Exercise,Advice while recovering,"Looking for some encouragement and advice. I was in a rollover crash at the end of May that has left me with a shoulder injury that is still being treated. My back, neck, spine, and ribs have all healed, but my shoulder is still a problem. Concussive movements are a problem, so running is out and walking still causes pain.

Before this, I had worked my butt off for a year to get from 345-225. I’ve crept up to 245 since the accident, and I want to get back to exercise and losing weight for my wedding next year. Nothing as extreme as my original loss… just to get back to a comfy level of health and maybe a little lower than where I was.

Any advice (diet, too… it’s been easy to use snacking as a coping mechanism) is greatly appreciated. I know that it’s hard considering I’m still dealing with the injury, but I desperately want to get back to lifting as soon as I’m able and burn this belly chub off!",kitsunecutie,self.Exercise,1634501607

Exercise,Exercise with ankle injury,"About six months ago I fractured my ankle and did some pretty bad ligament damage. I ignored it until a couple months ago (stupid I know) but I'm now getting it looked into, just churning through the public health system slowly.

Ive recently become seriously committed to bettering myself overall, and I want to exercise in addition to diet to lose about 45kg.

Are there any exercises that I can do without placing strain in the ankle and relying on it particularly heavily?

I can walk, but only for about half hour to an hour before I need rest. I can't stand solely on the one leg (left) and generally I try to treat it pretty gently. 

I will be getting physio. Just looking for a way to lose weight using the rest of my body while I recover.

I'm pretty lucky genetics wise for my legs never had to go super crazy to build them, every 4 days was my old routine. AND I NEVER SKIPPED LEG DAY. Curently calfs are 18"", with the smallest layer of fat, maybe .5"".  Thighs 28"". Arguably about 1-1.5"" of that is fat.

Is once a once a week workout going to be enough to maintain this for my calfs and still build some additonal thigh muscle just to finish sculpting it out again?

Exercise,The importance of balance in muscle(in my life)and lessons:,"I never exercised consistently to begin, I ran and also lift random things when asked but I haven't regularly exercise in 3+ years. Im 21. When I was 19 I was told I needed to skate to have the job I applied for(carhop at sonic, so you skate) I decided for some reason only training my left side was a good idea. Here is the results over 2+ years:

Tho I became very good at what I did, I didnt realize my improper form would destroy both my body and skates in the long-term. My right wheel to this day doesnt roll bc the bearings are shocked. Bc all my weight was on the left side of my body. Iliac, tricep,abs, you name it. I decided i'd do one side at a time.
*NEVER DO THIS*

My bed became lopsided bc my left side was too strong to keep an even mattress.
Everyday life became harder as, the way your muscles work, is contraction amd subduction. If one of these is canceled(i.e constantly not subducting the right to lift the left) YOUR BODY will moprh to find a way to do so. Its a a painful process to both do and undo. As today Im practicing on holding my left still while doing the right. Everyday until you become balanced you will be in pain, discomfort. Like something needs to be fixed which mentally tells you you are not in the right place in your life. 

You search for answers where there aren't instead of realizing the situation.( As your body grows accustom to the pain and movement)because youre always uncomfortable you tire quickly,Cant seem to exercise, lose courage etc

It really tells you how the bricks you build your pyramid of, makes and affects the final construct.

I still sweat and I still pant a lot,  but i dont take breaks anymore and that heavy feeling in my chest in every routine is gone.

Cause even the hiit workout i can finish without pausing for 20 mins and that concerns me because i give it my all,  but people say u should feel like u are d///ying when doing this.

I was around 225lbs at 5'10"".  I ended up with a compression fracture in my lower spine. That same day I found out that I have a degenerative disc disease on top of arthritis all in that area of the spine. I lost my job (due to not being able to do the job anymore) and my doctor told me I couldn't run anymore due to it crushing my spine even more so. You see running was my thing. I used to run 6 miles every other day even at my weight. I just enjoyed it alot.

So here's my problem, I can't do the exercise I loved anymore. Also, any time I ask my doc for a exercise program to do at the gym, all they do is give me stretches (I know they help with my problem). I have been gaining so much weight from a now sediment lifestyle (my fault I know) as I am now 275lbs. At this point I'm losing my mind and I have another baby on the way. I am in greater pain than I've ever been in before due to progressively getting fatter. I want to work out but I can't find many fitness programs to cater to my back needs.

Exercise,Looking for help designing an at home workout.,"Ok so I'm a 22 year old male, around 5'8""-5'9"", and last I checked I was 150lb. I used to weight a constant 130lb but after I moved out into my own place a few months back I started eating more chicken, less unhealthy foods, and even cut out caffeine from my diet. I still intake some sugar but not nearly the same amount as before.  


Idk how I gained 20lb after quitting soda and making a small attempt at eating better foods but I did. I'm sorta the skinny type, ectomorph body type if that helps. I work in a kitchen so I get some exercise but I'm not happy with my look, I've got a noticeable but not overly big gut now, somewhat strong legs, and skinny arms so I feel mismatched and I want to work on getting a more lean and toned build.  


I don't have much time or money for the gym so I was looking for a good at home workout routine that might be good for me. I'm no expert on exercise and finding someone to just... build or provide a good workout plan for free isn't something one can hope to expect. Thats why I'm coming here to hopefully find some helpful advice and suggestions. I also have ADHD so staying motivated and keeping to a workout is hard for me as I procrastinate and do things that hold my interest more.

Exercise,How to lose fat? (male - 15),"Hello all! So I'm a 15 year old boy who wants to lose fat.
I am overweight. Not like unhealthy fat, can't walk or anything like that, I just have too much belly fat. I'm around 162cm (not measured myself for quite a while, but this is approximate) and around 65kg. These are rough numbers, not 100% sure about them.
So, I'm generally not very happy with my body, and I'm really not comfortable with my body around other people. So now is the 13th of October. The summer is coming in next year, and I am going on a summer holiday with a bunch of my friends in August. I wanna transform until then. I wanna be comfortable with my body so I can enjoy my holiday. As I've calculated, it's around 9 months from now.
I really don't care about the number that the scale gives me, as I know that muscles are heavier than fat, so I know I will gain weight if I workout (lose fat, but build muscles). I just wanna get fit and start building muscles (but I don't wanna be a bodybuilder or anything, just have some abs and muscly arms,..)
Currently, I have belly fat, and my chest is big, and I don't know why that is (is it fat too or what?)
I cycle regularly, going for my first 100km ride this weekend, but I won't be able to ride my bike during winter so much.


What is the best way for me to lose the fat? What workouts to do? And can someone please tell me more about calories intake/outtake and how I wanna measure that, etc.?

As I said, I have around 8 months to accomplish my goal, and I know change isn't coming overnight, but I think 8 months is a pretty reasonable timeframe for my goals.

Very much thank you to all of you!",PensionOdd5369,self.Exercise,1634080070
Exercise,"Wanting to Exercise, But Feeling Drained. Advice?","I’m a 22-year-old male who weighs 157, so that makes my BMI 26.9, which means I’m overweight. I’ve been wanting to do exercise for my health, as well as lose weight. I used to go to the gym at my college, and weighed around 140-145 (can’t exactly remember but it’s around that range). 

However, since the pandemic, I’ve been stuck at home, doing nothing but lazing about and eating unhealthy. Fast-food is sometimes my comfort, and sometimes I eat out of boredom. It’s also been draining my wallet. 

I often eat with large proportions at night, and usually have some sweets too (like iced coffee, which I have to have sugar and milk with). I also eat a large amount super fast. It’s hard to quit, cause I get my cravings a lot. I’m also very picky, and don’t eat a lot of vegetables. I do eat fruit from time to time.

I’ve tried pacing the times that I eat, but at night, I get so hungry that I just want to shove as much food in my mouth and call it a day.

As for the gym situation, I’ve been having a lack of motivation. My college is 20 minutes away, and I often refrain from going due to the effort of driving back and forth. Just to go for an hour. In addition, I go there twice a week, with very late afternoon classes. So I’m drained from that. I also work too. 

I tried a one-day pass at a gym next to me, but I didn’t want to spend money each month. The college gym is free.

I have some equipment at home. I have two 20 lbs. dumbbells as well as a pull-up bar, but get drained easily, and I just want to put them down. For the pull-up bar, I used to do a lot, but now, it’s hard to do so cause of my weight. 

I’ve been very sensitive about my body and I’ve been called out about it by a few people. I honestly feel that I need to change, but I feel so unmotivated that really don’t want to do anything. 

Any advice for a lazy guy?",Speedster012,self.Exercise,1634078706

Exercise,I have no idea where to start and nobody to ask for help with exercise,"Hello. I guess I should give a general bg on myself; I'm 27, Female, about 5'3 and haven't weighed myself in so long but I'm definitely overweight (last time was 3 months ago, and I was at 165lbs). Weight loss isn't my main goal with exercise. I spend all day in bed, and I feel myself being dragged into another depressive episode. I've recently moved to another country all the way across the world, and I'm all alone. With Covid, I have very limited access to gyms and I'm also a student and can't afford expensive memberships. 

I also have a big problem with motivation; that is, getting up and moving. I get motion sickness from some movements (like burpee), my boobs hurt when I jump, and I get bored very easily. (ADD) I have wanted to try boxing for the longest time, but I've asked around and the general consensus is that I'll die if I start with that. I just need to really get this across, when I say I don't move I mean I don't move: I don't leave the housse unless I absolutely have to. This might mean once a week, or once every 3 weeks! I don't do exercises at home either. I rarely even sit on a chair. I'm 99% of the time lying on the bed. (Even as I type this up now) 

I know walking is a good start, but I won't do it. I'll do it for 1 day and then just won't. Is there anything else that can get me off my ass almost every day?! My goal is just to move, and then hopefully like moving and then start going to the gym and losing weight and ... For once in my life liking how I look? But for now, I just want to find something/anything that means moving. I do enjoy swimming, but I'm so very shy about going to a public pool and it's also difficult with Covid. I can't think of anything else tbh, so I'm hoping someone has an advice for me. Thanks.",copHerBoom,self.Exercise,1634076834

My concern is that do i need to push for the resistance training more and would that lessen the fat percentage or do i need to first shed the weight by pushing cardio and then focus more on resistance training? 

I like resistance training more than cardio and if the solution is more of full body workouts then that would be a better motivator than having to do more cardio.

However starting in July a bunch of stuff hit me, including a close friend passing away suddenly, my workload increasing, etc. Point is a lot of stuff hit me all at once and I stopped going to the gym.


I’m starting to pull myself out of the slump and want to get back into it. These days, I have a new dog so im walking her at least one mile a day in addition to my normal amount of walking. I’m also cutting down on caffeine and drinking more water.


Thing is I agreed to do some sporting events that are happening end of October through November, and its coming up faster than expected. First one is in 2.5 weeks and I don’t want to look a total fool.


The sport mostly relies on leg and core strength, and cardio is decently important too. 


Based on my personal schedule, I can only manage to go to the gym 3 days in a row followed by a rest day, and I can be at the gym for 1 hour each day.


What kinds of workouts can I do on this schedule, with a timeline of 2.5 weeks, to improve my fitness so i dont totally flop at my sport events? should i do legs, core, and cardio each day or have one day at a time to focus on each? any ideas are great, thanks!",ElephantsRTasty,self.Exercise,1634056894

Exercise,Anyone else get more sore doing at-home workouts than higher-weight machines?,"just got back to the gym last week for the first time since right before covid hit, and i was doing a mix of different youtube videos, running trails, or biking every day. the only weights i had at home were a pair of 5s and 3s, so for my strength-focused days i'd combine them, but even with that it was only 8-10 per hand/side total. 

so, when i returned to the gym and lifted heavier weights and did machines, i really thought i'd be insanely sore. like after some leg days at home with only the light dumbbells, i'd be sore and wobbling while i walk for a couple days after. so i'm really surprised i wasn't at that level of soreness after leg day for the first time, just slight soreness.

is this normal, common, expected? what was your experiences returning to heavier weights and machines after months/years exercising at home? could it be be that the at-home workouts have you doing standing, non-machine exercises more often, so it gets you sorer compared to machines where you may be sitting? idk, i'm just surprised! maybe i should try to change up the machines i use at the gym or do more free weight type stuff.",00evilhag,self.Exercise,1633911794

Exercise,Muscles more sore than normal - is that a protein deficiency?,"Background: I was bulking for 10-11 weeks starting in May, then cut for six. Now I'm back doing a bulk and my weight has stopped increasing. Granted I hurt my shoulder so I'm taking it easy on a couple fronts, so some lack of weight increase isn't surprising.

What is surprising is that, I started working out where I stay at max reps for all my exercises until I can complete all the reps for every set of every exercise, then I move it up. So if I have three leg exercises, and two are at 50 lb and 15/15 reps per set, but the third is at 50lb and I'm doing 14/15 for any number of sets, next week the weight stays the same. Otherwise they all go up to 55.

More importantly, my muscles are significantly more sore doing this than they were when I was cutting or initially bulking. Could this be a cause of a protein deficiency? 

I've looked this up and found stuff indicating that it is, but I'm hoping to get some direct responses to make sure I'm covering my bases.",Spacemage,self.Exercise,1633653555
Exercise,Exercise Bike at Home?,"Hey guys, 

So I live in an area where gyms have been pretty spotty about letting people use their equipment. You can go inside but because of the pandemic, you may have to wait for a spot on the equipment while they clean it down (every time someone uses a machine it gets tagged for cleaning). So an hour-long gym session can quickly turn into 1.5 to 2 hours.

**Because of this**, I was thinking about getting an at-home exercise bike to join my weights. I finally have the money to buy a decent at-home bike, but **I don't want something linked to the internet.** I just want to cycle without the bike feeling like it's about to fall over on every peddle. 

Avid home workout people, can you recommend a brand or specific type of exercise bike you like to use or wish you could buy? 

Again, I do not want to go down the Peleton style route. I often use my workout time to listen to my own thing, like a meditation of sweat. I am not interested in being a buff B-witch, just healthy enough to occasionally enjoy some take-out.

I would much prefer to do it of a night (9/10 - 11/12) as I have confidence issues and don't like to be around many people, especially in a gym environment. 

2) How should I diet to maximise losing weight? I do want to gain muscle as well, but my priority is losing weight as that causes me the most distress.

I get that I need to minimise (if not cut out) the saturated fats and sugars I intake, they are the main two aren't they? I should probably try drinking water more, too, as I don't do that enough anyways. Are there any types of foods or drinks or whatever that I should know about (whether it be to eat them or avoid them - also keep in mind I am rather picky about food)? 

3) What can I do at home and in my day-to-day when not at the gym to encourage my weight loss? 

Would I be good for me to be more active in my day-to-day, would it be necessary? Should I avoid sitting for too long? I hear that you should always have breakfast as it starts up your metabolism, is this true? Anything that I should be aware of! 

4) How should I change my sleep schedule, if necessary?

My current sleep schedule isn't very good. I'll typically sleep around 2-4 AM and wake up between 12-14 PM; if I work, that usually goes to about 1-2 AM till about 7-9, depending on the work of course. Is a good sleep schedule really required for losing weight effectively?

And of course, anything else you can think of that I should know! Whether it be about actual exercise or dieting. It would really help. Thank you for reading.",OyaHikikomori,self.Exercise,1633613399

Exercise,Achieving my goals,"Heyyy all, just wanted to ask if anyone can reassure me (or redirect me) that I’m on the right path for my fitness.

I had a baby 6 months ago and had a rough recovery (emergency c-section, lots of blood loss, infection etc) but have been signed off for exercise for the last three months. Prior to having a baby, I didn’t do much weight lifting, I was more cardio- I ran 5 days a week averaging 40+ km per week. Not being able to exercise in pregnancy and for three months afterwards was a mood killer and tough on me mentally and physically.

For the past three months I have been working hard in the gym. I knew I couldn’t just get back to running everyday without injury so my training schedule is as follows: two runs a week of 5km each time (building distance up gradually, I’m finally at 5k without needing to stop for a rest), three gym sessions per week (I run for twenty mins on the treadmill and then do a mixture of weights and body weight exercises- back squats (I’m upto 40kg so far), deadlifts (I’m at 80kg now), chest press etc, for an hour each session. I leave feeling sweaty and exhausted but pleased.

In terms of progress it’s really hard to get a good view on this- I don’t use scales (have encouraged some disordered eating in my past) but my partner firmly believes I’ve lost some. Does this routine sound ok? I’m a bit new to weights and I think cardio in the past has stripped weight off me quicker so does weights take longer to show results?",Kindly_Rate_9,self.Exercise,1633444681

I now weigh 11.5 stone but I still have more weight to lose so have signed up to a local gym to try and speed things up.

My main aim is to lose my man boobs but I'm aware I can't control where weight drops off so was wondering if anybody could help with some advice/ recommendations?

If I do 15 min cardo session each morning accompanied by 20 min weights each session focusing on my chest area - high reps low weights - will that not promote weight loss in my chest area?

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a spin bike yesterday off of Facebook market place. I thought I was buying something used - but when I showed up it was in a box. I didn't think much of this at the time, but as I was driving home it dawned on me that this was probably a bad sign. Live and learn. While I was assembling the bike, I noticed that the wheel doesn't fully line up with the brake pad all the time, because it isn't straight - it's slightly curved. The wheel has a wobble to it, when you pedal it lines up perfectly with the pad, and then moves to the right, then to the center, then back to the right. It never completely leaves the pad - but it goes more than half way off before coming back. I've been looking around online to try to see if this is by design or not - but I can't find any information on this. The brand (HONRISE) doesn't even seem to have a website? Just third party retailers. [This](https://www.amazon.ae/HONRISE-Exercise-Shock-absorbing-Cycling-Adjustment/dp/B08FHTGQ33) is the model, I guess they don't carry it on Amazon where I'm from (Canada) because this links to the UAE.

Add to that the requirements due to weight training regimen 3x a week, and I am just *not* able to meet my daily protein requirements. I have a scoop right after workout, but that's it. Natural foods I consume during the day include eggs, milk, seeds, almonds, lentils, etc. But I am not even coming close to the large quantity of protein I need daily to lose weight and build muscle.  
So my question is, it is safe and effective for me to consume another scoop of whey protein during the day, as a snack? I wish I could eat meat, but I just really can't, so considering all this, I'd love some advice here!

Exercise,"Legs ""locking up"" while running - curious if anyone has any strategies to avoid this","The weather where I live is finally getting nice enough to run again. A friend of mine invited me to go running on a really nice scenic run weekly that is about 10 miles in distance. I'm running into an issue where even though my cardio health feels fine - I'm not getting super elevated heart rate, and my breathing seems OK, and I'm not uncomfortable in that aspect, I find that my legs just absolutely start locking up and tightening. It gets really uncomfortable as early as 3-4 miles into the run (we load up the first part of the run with hills.. there's two ways to go and we can either take the hills at the start or the end, which we opt for the start).  

The other activity I take part in is crossfit 3-4x a week. I have been at it since about October of 2020 (so close to a year now) and we do a lot of leg workouts there, but most of our running is sprinting. The massage therapist I go to mentioned that my IT band is like a rock and that it shouldn't be that way. We do a lot of leg work outs at my gym, but I usually have 2-3 days of rest before the 10 mile run which is typically enough for any soreness / fatigue to go away. So I'm usually starting the run pretty fresh.

I stretch before and after every work out (including the run), and roll out my legs often, and even do cupping treatment on my quads / IT band. 

I guess my questions are:

* Is loading the hills at the start of the run a bad idea?
* Does anyone have a recommended video on youtube or something that could help me identify good running form to avoid this?

Exercise,Dealing with Fat loss,"Well I’m not sure if this is the proper place to ask this but here goes:

So over the past couple of months, I lost quite a bit of fat and built up a decent amount of muscle. Yay! The problem now is, because of the fat loss I’ve been feeling a lot colder lately, and going into the winter months this may suck because I also have poor blood circulation, does anyone have any advice on staying warm? I can always put on extra layers but if there’s some body or exercise technique I can use I’d appreciate any advice.

Exercise,Running - the king of cardio?,"I may just be rambling here, but from personal experience I have to say running is the king of cardio. That is, speaking from purely a conditioning standpoint. 

I’ve worked out for 20 years (now 34). I was a fat kid. Started walking, then jog walk, then running. Gradually I stopped running and switched over to weights, exercise bike and jump rope. My resting heart rate is/was 48. I’m 5’11, 207 lbs. I lift 3 days a week, cardio 3 days a week. I thought I was in decent shape. 

Then I ran a 5k outside. 

Talk about being humbled. Couldn’t even finish the hills without taking a breather the first week. I ran a 30:37 and now 3 weeks later I’m at 28:30. Would love to get down to sub 25.

Im mainly just posting this because it was very eye opening for me. I’ve researched “which cardio is best” and the answers seem to vary. Obviously running can be taxing on your knees and back, so there are cons. But I’m absolutely convinced now that running is levels beyond any other cardio for pure endurance. 

If you disagree, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.

My muscles are fine and I rarely have issues there, it's just my lungs/stamina that's the issue. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to start getting in better shape when I can barely get through a workout? Right now I'm doing Couch 2 5k and while it seems like a great program, I can't even fully complete the first set of exercises (it's interval training with 8 sets of 90 seconds walking and 60 seconds running. I can only run 5 or 6 times before I'm about ready to collapse)",faithandfatherhood,self.Exercise,1632513610

I really want to use it but am really worried that if I use it on an uneven surface I’ll injure myself but putting too much strain on one side of my body. Any advice for this? Is it indeed dangerous or at risk for straining one side of my body?

I can’t have it inside, and there’s no even surface in my yard ( it’s not uneven to the point that the bike will fall or anything, but you can definitely see it leaning more to one side). The reason I am adamant on using my bike is because it was my favourite piece of equipment before I moved to my new house.

Exercise,Lower back,"I (M70) re-started exercising about 2 1/2 years ago and have seen a significant improvement in my strength, weight and shape. I use 1.5lb wrist weights, 2.5lb ankle weights and dumbbells, which are currently set at 10lbs each (they were up to 15lbs but this year I scaled back). I have a routine which I try to keep to which is exercising on Mon, Wed, Fri. The exercises hit areas from the ankles to the neck and the areas are spread out over the three days. I have been focusing on my arms, chest and core most. There are only two exercises I was doing on all three days and they are 25 - Around the worlds holding the wrist weights and 15 - Mountain Climbers. On two days I was doing wide push-ups (sometimes hitting 15) but lately I have not been doing the mountain climbers or push-ups because it has been bothering my lower back, particularly the right side. Are there any exercises I can do using only the equipment I have that can strengthen my lower back  without the stress of floor exercises like the push-ups and mountain climbers?

Exercise,I feel like I'm plateauing in my cardio health,"Hi folks,

I'm hoping a few of you have encountered this and have some advice on how to get past it. While in quarantine I really let my cardio health slip and I promised myself that when I got fully vaxed, I'd throw myself into exercising. I turned 30 this summer and heart health has been an issue in my family and it's something I want to avoid. Since I started doing a lot of cardio I feel loads better. However, I feel like I'm hitting a plateau in my cardio exercise. 

My routine since mid-June has been to do about 30 minutes of high intensity interval training every weekday morning. My fitness trackers on my apple watch showed noticeable improvements on an almost weekly basis. I could feel the progress and it was really encouraging. In the past couple weeks I increasingly feel like I'm hitting a wall though. Whereas before, when maybe 45 seconds to a minute of high intensity exercise would get me to my target heart rate, I now have trouble getting up to and holding my target heart rate. It's not that I'm exercising less intensely either, if anything I can tell I'm putting in even more effort than before. It's basically like my heart health has improved so much that the old exercises aren't as much of a challenge anymore. 

I've tried upping my goals, going more intensely in my interval training or trying to do longer intervals and I've had some success in that. Except past a certain point I feel like I just run out of gas. Basically, it feels like my cardio health is so good now that I don't have the energy when I exercise do actually give my heart a workout anymore. In some ways, this feels like a good problem, but I'm frustrated because I'm still not where I want to be in terms of my overall heart health.

I've been using body glide for my thighs (I'm a bigger guy) which has helped with me stopping chafing. I suppose I could give it a try on that toe if it's friction to see if that helps any. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",xxteargodxx,self.Exercise,1631973907

Exercise,Should I lose fat first or build muscle first.,"I am 5'9 and 170lbs. According to my BMI this makes me just a bit overweight.  Body fat percentage is 22% which is fine but by no means indicative of any great fitness level. I would imagine a healthy weight would be around 140-145. Anyway, I want to put on 10-15lbs of muscle, putting my final ideal weight at around 155. Should I put on the muscle first, hit 185, and then try to lose the 30lbs? Or would it be easier to focus solely on losing the 30lbs now and then add muscle after? I'd imagine it would be easier to do things with full range of motion if I had less weight so I'm leaning towards the second option but I'd be curious to hear what people think if you have any similar experience?",thekielbasastore,self.Exercise,1631907323

Exercise,New to consistent exercise. Did I over do it?,"So for a while now I have been wanting to get into shape. Its been a long time since I've had an active life style (9+ years) and felt that it was time to change. I went out and bought a smart treadmill and installed it in my garage and started my fitness journey. 

I started jogging/walking 2 miles every day (except for sundays) for 1 month total. I made sure I had a good stretch 15 minutes before and after my sessions on the treadmill. It was going great and I was working up a sweat every time. I felt good and it was going smoother than I had imagined it would. I was watching my calorie intake, making sure I had enough carbs and protein for fuel and making sure that I was always hydrated all the time. 

After this one month passed of me exercising consistently, I can feel fatigue in my legs/calfs. I can get out of and into bed fine, but walking for a decent period of time and attempting to go for my usual jog/walk on the treadmill is impossible right now.. No matter what position I am in whether its standing or sitting for a long period of time, It feels like my legs are shaky/weak. I can feel it especially in my thighs and for a short period of time it felt like I had shin splints. That eventually went away, but the fatigue in my legs is still present and slowing me down. So I was wondering if I over did it with the amount and pace I started at? Has anyone else experienced something like this before?",mariolink93,self.Exercise,1631884575
Exercise,Will rubber grips on dumbbells create calluses on hands?,"I bought some new dumbbells that come with rubber grips, and I’m somewhat forced to ditch my gloves because these rubber grips are wider/thicker than the other dumbbells I have been using. So if I use the gloves, my grip strength begins to tire and the dumbbells begins to slip on me. Without the gloves, my grip strength is stronger. I don’t care much about the calluses, but I also don’t want it to get out of control.

I do have lifting straps, but I use them only on a few exercises. Very soon I’m about to begin doing hand grip exercises to have less of a problem with gripping the dumbbells. Hopefully at some point I can ditch the lifting straps.",OracleTrucker,self.Exercise,1631866892

Exercise,Are stationary bikes -- or electric bikes -- an effective way to burn calories?,"Right now, I'm in a bit of a rut. I go to work, then go home, that's about it. I can't use the gym at work anymore (they're still requiring people to book ""time-slots"" to protect against covid), and there's only one ""gym"" within 30 min of my house,  and it seems mainly dedicated to being a yoga space, no real weights or anything.

For reasons beyond this, I'm considering moving, but have considered either investing in a stationary bike, or possibly an electric bike (hear me out before dismissing it!).

Honestly, my *only* goal right now is weight loss. So burning calories is great, but just as important *for me*, is just ""time spent doing *something*"", that isn't thinking about eating. I've never been in great health, but I've definitely noticed that the more bored I am, the more I tend to ""snack"". I've gotten rid of pretty much all that type of food, but I feel like I need some sort of mental stimulation.

The other idea I've considered is picking up an electric bike. The idea honestly never crossed my mind, until a coworker of mine was talking about it, and mentioning he feels way better. I sort of laughed at first, thinking ""don't those things basically ride themselves?"", and his response that he only really uses the ""electric"" part of it, when he's going up particularly difficult hills, or if he's been riding all day, and just feels exhausted.

He made kind of a compelling case for it; that when he had a normal bike, he only went for a ride once or twice a month, but because the electric bike deals with ""the hard stuff"", he's actually going riding pretty much every day because it's so much more enjoyable. Particularly if I wind up moving back down south near my family, I could also see something like that being useful for my father, who has back issues but really *needs* some amount of light exercise.

I mean, at least with the electric bike, at the very least it provides some amount of ""entertainment value"". For a stationary bike, though, I'm unsure how useful those are for actively burning calories, or if that's just an expense that's realistically unlikely to make much if an impact on my actual weight-loss journey?",Jcorb,self.Exercise,1631722237

I knew something happened but I assumed I slightly pulled a muscle or something since it’s just ping pong. The pain quickly subsided and today is my leg day in the gym and as soon as I did one set of squats, the pain came back fairly stronger (but not unbearable). I obviously stopped leg day there cause I don’t want to risk injury and did arms instead. My question is, what do I do now? Do I wait one week and try again to see if the pain goes away naturally?

Exercise,Need advice on chest injury due to exercise," 

Hi guys so I'm new to fitness and I need advice about my chest injury. I did some delt stretches with cables two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure it caused my chest injury due to incorrect form. I'm not sure how serious it is but it has been plaguing me for 2 weeks now.

I first noticed it when washing my hands or hanging my towel but I thought nothing of it. A couple of days later it still didn't get better but it is barely noticeable so I had my chest day (bench press, cable fly, dips, push up). I didn't feel any pain until the following day when I sneezed really hard. From then on it seems like the pain increased sharply. Washing my hands no longer hurts but it hurts if I sit up from a lying down position. It hurts if I sneeze or cough or have hiccups. But it doesn't really hurt if I do bench presses or push-ups which is weird. Wider push-ups hurt a bit more though.

I took some meds a few days ago and it seems to be getting better but just now I sneezed really hard again and all of the pain came back. Btw I stopped doing ALL exercises since last week. Idk if I should go see a doctor or physical therapist. For routine, I mostly copied Athlean X's perfect exercises.

Edit: It hurts the most if I do a particular core exercise: Opposite side elbow to knee when in the plank position and I try to touch my left elbow with my right knee while supported by my right arm and left foot.",Nighgaler,self.Exercise,1631280706

Exercise,recommended exercise for someone who has weak lungs and wants to lose belly and man boobs?,"so before i am a guy about 100 kg and because of the pandemic i got fatter, i am now at around 105kg 

i plan to do some exercises during the weekend morning, saturday and sunday only since  i have a regular job during weekdays from 8am to 5pm 

as the title already says, i have a big belly and some man boobs, any exercises that you can recommend to me to lose this? 

i did some google-ing and i saw that most of the exercises to remove man boobs are  barbell press, bench press, pec deck etc.. which all require gym equipment and i dont have those nor the money to buy them.. most of the gyms in our country are also closed because of the pandemic 

i also have weak lungs so i get tired very easily and i catch my breath easily but i can do high intensity workouts if needed 

any recommendations for people like me?

Exercise,What exercise can I do? Exercise induced panic attacks.,"Hi folks, hoping for some advice. I'm 25f, healthy weight maybe leaning towards the lower side, looking to get into some kind of exercise routine. I get exercise induced panic attacks which makes things hard.

I used to jog/run and did it pretty consistently, did some 10k races and a half marathon etc but honestly it made me very depressed and anxious. The majority of the time I would either get a panic attack or feel so low that I would harm myself after. So I said bye to that, but I was probably at my fittest then (2019). I love hiking and hillwalking but don't have any peaks near me, so can only go inconsistently. I love walking but feel like it doesn't do enough to raise my heart rate. I have a gym nearby but the cost and not knowing what to do scares me. I used to go to a private gym and work out in a small group, but I mainly ended up on the side with panic attacks (I was also super depressed at the time lol). I used to skate on a roller Derby team which I loved, but covid ended that. I also used to do yoga semi regularly but now I'm out of the habit when I don't have space inside. I've tried getting into a routine of body weight exercises but they rarely stick and when I go hard, I just panic badly. 

I have a small outside space that I can use. I've tried looking for bodyweight routines on YouTube but I'm lost with where to begin. Everything just feels so overwhelming. I've recently changed jobs which allows for a lot more time to exercise, I just don't know what I can do and where to begin. It sounds dumb but I could cry thinking about it. I have GAD so that might go some way to explaining it, and I feel like this is all actually classic GAD avoidance/excuses because it gives me a lot of anxiety about getting panic attacks. But I want to have something in place, I just don't know what. 

Does anyone have any advice? Anyone had experience themselves or of someone else with exercise induced panic attacks?",lucwhy,self.Exercise,1630880411

Exercise,The transformation,"GOOD MORNING EVERYONE!

What a day to be alive. Hope you’re all striving towards your goals. 

I just wanted to write this to anyone pushing late nights/ early mornings/ struggling to do either. Whether it’s working or not, I’m proud of you for making the decision to change. 

I was once where you were. Wasn’t happy with my body, was eating junk all day long, was pretty depressed and was giving into instant gratification all day long because I didn’t have that motivation or drive to get to where I needed to be. 

I know a lot of you have been trying really hard to either get your body back in shape or come back from a dark place. Some of you want to start exercising regularly, while some have been doing it and not getting results. Some just need to make that mental change. I understand you. 

It’s crazy looking back at the old me now. I was so lost. I’m just here to tell you that your destiny is completely under your control no matter who you are. Everyone has a different story or a different way they need to approach their goals, but all of us are going to make it. I’m not going to settle until I get everyone in this group to their goals, or simply changes their mentally so you all can get at your goals yourselves. 

The old me used to watch YouTube all day long. It took me a while to realize why this was, and now almost 3 months later, I can now say that I’m exactly where I need to be. 

You can do this. Current you struggling = future you proud. We either do it now or regret it later. 

My goal is to change 1000 people’s lives this year. I’m already at 255 starting from March. Whether it’s mentality, weight loss, muscle gain, getting into running or anything else I’ll probably be the right fit. 

What are you struggling with currently? I’ll see if I or someone else in the comments can help you.

Exercise,"Discussion: Has anyone tried palm or extremity cooling to increase work volume (from Huberman Lab podcast, episode 19)?","I've been listening to the Huberman Lab podcast and in episode 19, he describes a study where cooling your palms in-between sets radically increased the number of reps a person can do (300% for dips!).

The idea is that hyperthermia limits performance and cooling through the extremities prevents that.

Huberman claims that this methodology is being used by lots of sports teams and that they've been getting great results.

Frankly, this sounds way too good to be true.

[There are a number of peer reviewed papers demonstrating the effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22076097/), however:

* They're from the original authors, who started a company to commercialize the technology
* The company was founded in 2000 and don't appear to have been able to bring anything to market in the last 20 years.
* I found a couple examples of replications that don't show anything like the effect size the original authors see, plus the results don't show a proper dose/response.

I'm tempted to try this myself to see if there's any validity to the claims (easy enough experiment and claimed gains are enormous).

Exercise,Why are the NHS protein recommendations so low?,"I've been trying to eat more sensibly in order to make sure my working out isn't going to waste. I've started logging my diet on MFP and have been recommended 112g per day based on what I do.

What am I missing? I'm not looking to bulk up but that strikes me as one hell of a gap between those two figures. And it's not as if the NHS isn't authoritative.

Exercise,I need some advice on what direction I should take my workout routine in.,"So, I've never been fit at any point in my 26 years of life. I've just kinda been average. Recently in February I started jogging around a local park for 30 minutes semi daily 3-4 times a week. I no longer get winded and I kind of enjoy the exercise.

About at the beginning or middle of July, I got a gym membership. I started going about 3-5 times a week. I know this might trigger people, but I always do 30 minutes on a treadmill, then 3 sets of push up, 3 set of horizontal dumbbell squat, 3 sets of 10 5 pound set ups and 3 sets of 15 Russian twist.

I usually reserve weight lifting for the weekend since it's empty. 3 sets of 15  60 pounds bicep curls and 3 sets of 15  60 pounds barbel chest press.

I know this is sloppy, but I really don't have template or general knowledge of this subject matter.

Im requesting some advice on this one.",deepwoodmot,self.Exercise,1630429213

Exercise,Knee Joint pain after taking a break from a 6-week straight daily walk,"Beforehand I'd like to mention that I'n not exaaactly sure this is the subreddit to ask, as I've never really relied on reddit for exercise tips. Nonetheless, here is some elaboration:

I'm a 21-year-old 162 cm (5' 4"") male. I started walking for exercise on the streets of Lebanon after finally putting myself on a program to lose weight. When I started, I was 105 KG/231 lbs. I dropped 7 Kilos down to 98 KG/216 lbs. This was all between July 16 and August 27.

I started walking exactly 1000 steps/0.4 KM a day and gradually increased it to 13,000 steps/10 KM (which is the most I've ever walked in a single day) These walks I do are on Lebanese streets, which are far from the standard flat-surfaced sidewalks in other countries. Throughout the program, I've not felt much pain from the walking besides the standard soreness and, once, numb feet for a few hours after a walk.

Now, three days ago, my family and I went up to our village in the mountains, and I decided to take a break from walking for at least a week while I'm there. After resting for a full day, I woke up the day after with severe pain in my Knee Joints. They don't hurt when I cross my legs or keep them straight, but hurt like a motherf***er everywhere in between. It's very hard to walk in the house, let alone a 13,000 step walk.

Three days have passed with me sitting most of the time on my bed, feet straight and a pillow underneath, and yet, nothing has really changed. So, as I sit here wanting to go on the beautiful escape that is a long walk, I decided to ask reddit to find out the source. Aaaany advice is hella appreciated 🙌🙌",Jwawad,self.Exercise,1630424843

It's a small grocery store where I'm the only employee at any given time, and I mostly either sit or stand and wait for customers. Now I was wondering if there were any exercises I could do while there's no one there, it's not a very popular store and I can go hours without a customer, so I can set aside a while to exercise. Preferably something for my legs that doesn't require me to go on the floor lol, I pretty much only know of squats. Any ideas, folks?",yahwol,self.Exercise,1630407143
Exercise,Settle an exercise related debate for me please,"I recently started a 14 day exercise regimen with my friend (we both have been very sedentary the last two years). After day 1 I realised that I'm in no position to finish all the exercise that were a part of day 1 (squats, weighted curls, planks etc) because I was not able to do any of them for the prescribed 50 seconds time.
I think that I should first concentrate on getting my strength and endurance up by slowly building up to be able to finish day 1 properly and then continuing the 14 day regimen, but my friend thinks that I should half ass the daily exercises and finish the 14 day regimen in 14 days (because doing just day 1 repeatedly is pointless and useless, according to him) 
My point here is that if right now I can hold only a 15 second plank and I'm just okay with that level of stamina and half ass all the other exercises, what exactly am I gaining here?
So which one of us is right?

I hope this post is not breaking any rules. If it is, then please let me know",cuppycakebaby123,self.Exercise,1630407060

Exercise,Inviting comments on my treadmill exercise plan.,"I'm a 41yo male with a job that's not completely sedentary, but doesn't keep me fit either.

I have a treadmill that's been sitting in the basement for a couple years, a couple weeks ago I brought it out and made it usable again.

In my past attempts to get fit, I've had a pattern of being too ambitious and either burning out or hurting myself. This time, My strategy is to start with a long term plan to gradually ramp up. My treadmill has speed increments of 0.1 mph and inclination increments of 0.5%, so from 0% inclination at 2.2 mph to 10% inclination at 10 mph, there are 1659 combinations of speed and inclination. If I do a different combination every day, it should take me about 4.5 years to work up to max out my treadmill. I've read that 4 miles per day is a sustainable amount of exercise without wearing out knees, hips, etc... So my tentative plan is to do 4 miles a day, each day at a different combination of speed and inclination, until I'm maximizing out my treadmill.

I've made a spreadsheet to track my progress...
https://1drv.ms/x/s!AsGMDZhentC3g85WMBf6_8xmZe-XTA

I'm trying to fill in boxes kinda sparsely until it starts getting difficult so that I'll have some easy ones to come back to in the future on days that I don't feel up to a more vigorous work-out. At the same time, I'm trying not to ramp up too fast either... Trying to maintain a balance.

I know that walking in place counts as steps ( a lazy way ) 5 years ago I could do a set of 100 push ups. ( just fast one’s with bad form ) and I was in a lot better shape. 

While in bed do leg extensions or finding lazy ways to get the burn help? I know that there are a lot better things to get your blood flow going and I’ll be starting them ( actually walking around the block ) and doing things that I wouldn’t have to ask about. 

Are there any ways to get your blood flow or circulation better while lying down ? I know it’s a lazy way, but just in a short term sense. 

Had to get an ultrasound on my legs to check for blood clots. I have to begin slow as well so a brisk jog right now is actually too much. I know I’ll move past this, but rather then staying in one position?

Then onto a vegetarian diet, also with exercise, and then to vegan.

I want the exercises to target the same parts of the body, but I also don’t want my muscles becoming accustomed to those exercises, so that they may skew the results. What should I do to prevent this?",South-Marionberry,self.Exercise,1630004730

I know this may sound stupid bc it is too obvious to some people, but i really do not know what to do and would genuinely appreciate some advice.

Context: i lost 10kg (22 pounds) due to gallstones and since i’m waiting for surgery, i do wanna recover at least 5 kg as too skinny from my perspective. The problem is that my round gets fat easily, and i will try to avoid that.

Should i do some concrete exercises to prevent that, or do i just have to train all my body? i honestly do not know if that way the fat would become muscle or something like that (if you could explain it to me or smth but that’s opcional). As you can see, i’ve never trained in my life haha.

I've cut out most of the destructive factors (drugs, cigarettes, booze), but gained 20lbs since covid without golf and other activities.  Physical actually was a lot better than expected- only out of range factors were LDL Cholesterol and GGT for Liver. Everything else was within normal standards. I live in a middle eastern country, so alcohol will be zero for upcoming year and am going cold turkey on cigs - I had gone from 3/4 pack/day to 1/2 to 1/4 to 2 cigarettes/day, but cold turkey from here on out...I feeling good about these.

Exercise though - I love playing sports and was very active until late 30s, but not in the gym.  I actively dislike weights and running, but this is where I have to overcome and find the joy/benefits of working out.  I plan on doing the 10 story stairwell (just did a down/up all flights and got a good heart rate going after going down and climbing five and powered through back to top floor) I'll hopefully find a lightly used treadmill or exercise bike and stick to the plan. That's the goal at least. I've got starter pics, but not too proud of them, so I'll wait until some progress is made.",Braunnoser,self.Exercise,1629908537

Exercise,Preventing Catabolism during Cardio,"I’ve recently started riding a stationary bike, at home.  I noticed two nights ago and tonight, that my sweat has started to smell like ammonia after about 45:00min.  I read that this is muscle being broken down because I haven’t had enough carbs and my body is burning muscle for energy.  Tonight I had pasta for dinner about 2-3 hours before my work out and I had a protein shake at lunch that also has carbs in it.  My goal is to slim down and gain muscle at the same time by working with free weights EOD.   What exactly do I need to eat and how long before the work out to prevent this, from happening?  Could this be that the supplement Whey Protein shake is really what smells so awful being sweat out instead of muscle protein?  I’m ok with that I guess.  I don’t know what other info you need,  I ride for an hour at an average of 16 mph, and am able to keep my heart rate bouncing between cardio and peak zones.  Then I ride a cool down of about 5-15 min at a leisurely pace so my legs don’t cramp up, and I can bring my heart rate down slowly.  Is there something I should eat right after?  Like a hand full of pumpkin seeds or something. ( I prefer food to supplements if I can).  I’ve always seen food as pleasure rather than fuel, I’m just starting to try to educate myself on using food for fuel rather than pleasure, the opposite got me to 275lbs at 38.  I’m down to 248 but want to make sure that I am losing fat instead of muscle weight.  Thanks I’m advance for your replies.",Texanic,self.Exercise,1629807720

I tried doing a mixture of both but I don’t know if it’s as effective as a different method. The way I mixed the two was for example, for my chest and arms day which looked like this:

Dumbbell Flies (high reps/low weight)
Curls (high reps/low weight)
Tricep Extensions (high reps/low weight)
Lateral Raises (high reps/low weight)
Dumbbell Flies (low reps/high weight)

1) when i go to the gym, i usually just use the machines because i otherwise have no idea what i'm doing. is that good enough to gain muscle?

2) are there any good, reputable workout regiments online that are tried and true to help bulk up?

3) i'm not a huge fan of the belly i've got. i'm by no means obese or fat, but i'd really like to be more lean. i know a lot of this has to do with diet, but if i consume a lot of food in order to bulk up, wouldnt my stomach get bigger too? and if i do cardio to lose weight, wouldnt that cut back on the calories i'm trying to gain to gain muscle?

Exercise,Trying to lose weight and tone up. Am I doing this right?,"I am a 5ft 4in female. 22 years of age and go to the gym 3x a week, MWF. I started at 215 lbs and am now 212 lbs. I have been exercising with this routine since July 8th. I am trying to lose 70 lbs by this time next year to start. Is my workout regimine going to get me to my goal within 1 year? What can I do to target fat loss in addition to this? I currently cook all my meals and eat chicken breast, and half of my meal consists of a nutrient dense veggie like Kale, Spinach, cauliflower, mushroom etc... I don't like pasta or rice but i make 1 cup of rice and that lasts me 4 meals. I'll usually make rice 2 or 3x a month for filler. I'm trying to cut out most sugar and replace it with fruit. Most of the time I don't eat breakfast or I'll have a protein shake when I get home. However I do snack heavily and am cutting down on buying junk food to replace with whole foods. I eat Sardines or tuna as a late night snack, but slip up with junk sometimes so I don't buy it anymore unless I've been consistent for 3 weeks straight. Also no more food orders except for 3x a month. 

My workout includes: 

3 sets of weighted sumo squats with 10 reps each. Set 1: 10lbs. Set 2: 20 lbs. Set 3: 35lbs
100 bicycle kicks
50 side crunches on each side
100 crunches
10 minutes walking on a treadmill 

Hip adduction/abduction machine (5 sets of 10 reps at 100 lbs for abduction and 60lbs for adduction). 
Leg press: 5 sets of 10 reps @ 200 lbs of weight. 
Hamstring machine: 50 lbs 5 sets of 10 reps. 

For arms I use bicep (25 lbs 10 reps; 5 sets) and tricep machines (35 lbs 15 reps; 5 sets) as well as a rowing machine.  This workout will take me about 2 hours then I walk home mostly and get about 7,000-10,000 steps in to and from the gym since I'll walk to the grocery store to pick up veggies before I head home and feel energized. I don't feel tired after this workout and have seen a big improvement in my strength, but I'd like to lose fat as well. Or am I just being impatient? 

I got this workout from the personal trainer at my gym but want something to target fat loss as well since I haven't seen physical results in fat reduction after over 1 month.",Angrboda229,self.Exercise,1629493626

Exercise,Early Morning Protein Usability,"Hi,

Something I’ve been curious about for some time is the issue of whether protein ingested long before a workout will actually aid in muscle protein synthesis, or if it will simply be used for energy.

There’s information about eating windows online, but much of it pertains to whether protein ingested a short time before a workout will aid in growth. Obviously, if you have been working out with weights within 48 hours of the meal, then your body will be a heightened state of protein synthesis inherently, so in that case it’s easily assumed that protein intake early in the day will aid with that. However, assume that the individual is untrained, or has simply had a few days off training. Will protein ingested at 9am aid in muscle growth for that day if the workout doesn’t occur until 5pm?",Being_Honest-,self.Exercise,1629287983

1) Can anyone recommend me on a suitable swimming routine to start with that will help me achieve my goals? 
2) Do I need to subsidise swimming with other exercises such as weight lifting? 
3) I eat generally pretty well but I am vegetarian and am wondering if buying protein will be beneficial alongside swimming? 
4) Finally are there any tips that helped you when you started swimming?",SoundSerendipity,self.Exercise,1629232886

Exercise,Beginner that needs some advice,"Hello all, first post here, I’m trying to get in shape and I’m looking for advice. I’m a 6 foot male and 200 pounds, looking for advice. I’ve been losing weight since January and I just recently decided to start adding exercise into my life, and I’ve got some questions.

What are some good exercises for burning fat and good exercises for building muscle? I’ve got a weight bench at home I can use. So far I’ve been doing bench press, low weight and high repetition, I usually do about 15 reps of 10 every workout, over about 30 minutes. I feel that may not be intense enough so would like others opinions on it.

What types of foods would be beneficial, both as a snack to eat before hand and recovery, as well as just general food tips.

How would intermittent fasting affect me now that I’m starting to be more active?

Now, at the age of 33, I'm out of the woods in terms of health, I doubt that I'll ever digress so now I can focus on going to the gym and get big, **but the question is, should I?**

Through these 18 years, I've played around with getting big. I did get noticeably big but never defined.  In the past 2 years, I've been playing with intermittent fasting I've gotten small! (COVID made me scared and mostly lazy but I'll get over it)

When I was big I was about 76kg

Can it be dangerous to work out this often and for 2.5 hrs at a time?

I do rest in between sets, especially when I am on my “max working” set. I also try to keep my reps between 8-15. I’ve been doing this for almost 2 years, but most of that time I was only working out to maintain my strength, not necessarily for growth. So I was working out once every 1-2 weeks.",OracleTrucker,self.Exercise,1628723870

Exercise,Running games?,"Hi everyone.

I used to love jogging on the Wii Fit. (Well, not “love”, exactly, but “hate marginally less than other forms of exercise” sounds a little negative.) It was very simple: put the controller in your pocket, and its accelerometer would determine your approximate jogging speed as you ran on the spot, with your avatar running through a much nicer world than the one you were actually in.

That was fourteen years ago. But I can’t find anything that comes close today. The closest I can find is Zwift, but leaving aside the fact that it’s littered with endless menus and lists of stats and is clearly aimed at serious people who do lots of running/cycling, you have to buy a pretty expensive “foot pod” to actually make your avatar run at the speed you’re jogging at. I have a treadmill (my wife’s anyway), but Zwift’s own foot pods seem to be permanently out of stock and alternative ones are hopelessly expensive.

There’s an app that promises to get around this: Treadmill Smart Speed, which you put on your phone and then use the phone like the Wii Fit controller of old, sending your running speed via Bluetooth to Zwift running on another device. This is exactly what I want! Except that it doesn’t work. It doesn’t register my speed most of the time; when it does, it has a huge lag; and it sends the speed to Zwift only intermittently.

So this is my question. I want an experience like Wii Fit jogging, where you put a phone or something similar in your pocket and a character on your TV screen runs through a virtual environment accordingly. Ideally I’d like it to be something simple enough for a small child to use - just like Wii Fit itself. Does anything like this exist on any platform? Or are we stuck endlessly running round Wiifitty Island for ever more?",JonathanCRH,self.Exercise,1628603058

Exercise,Getting back on the grind,"Hey everyone, 

Like many of you, my entire life has been flipped upside down the last two years. As of this morning, I decided to get a gym membership. 

I just left feeling a bit inspired but also discouraged. The gym is huge, with so many resistance bands, free weights, workout machines, and so many classes. 

I decided to walk around the gym, get familiar with some machines, then went on a 2 mile run (21 mins). Felt proud of myself, but I know there’s way more to this journey. 

So my question to y’all; do you have any specific workout regimes to build muscle, while remaining slim/slender. I’m 6’1 (male 33, sw 200, BMI 25%) and my ideal weight would be 185ish. I’m committing to 4-5 sessions a week, upwards of 2 hours a day. Thank you in advance.",abdoolah,self.Exercise,1628534564

I only did the routine for 3 days. In the second I got the soreness, but, in my chest, it came way stronger on the muscles right below my armipts, on the 2 sides of my chest, with barely any soreness on the muscles of the front chest.

Exercise,Tips for squats?,"I injured myself doing squats. I’d been doing them every day for a few weeks when I started noticing that my lower back was getting sore. I thought it was just regular tightness from working out. 

One morning, my lower back was stiff and even sitting down hurt. I realized it wasn’t pain from building muscle, but pain from overuse or poor form. 

A friend of mine took a look at my posture and said I might be overextending my back. 

I’ve heard that when doing squats, you should always keep your knees behind your toes and your butt should stick out. I think that might be why I overextended my back. 

I’m not sure how to continue doing squats, as I don’t want this to happen again. I’ve had to stop my workout schedule in order to allow time to heal, but two days ago I tried to work out again and the pain got worse again. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to do squats correctly? YouTube videos have been okay so far, but they don’t really help address proper form too much.",gateriijuice,self.Exercise,1628469868

Exercise,Help needed to spice things up,"I am 5’11” and have reduced from 82kg to 78kg (for reference, I was 76kg when I moved, but actually looked bigger than I am now - would post picture If I wasn’t self-conscious)

I used to be really active, and I played cricket at a pretty decent level before I moved very far from home (other side of the world). I know what it takes to ‘workout’, and had a set routine based around the sport I played. I could go to a gym and know what I was doing to benefit my performance. Since moving away, I can’t really play the sport (the standard is not really good enough to commit the time taken to play), but I remained active in other pursuits and felt healthy. 

During these Covid times, I gained a little weight, and have managed to reduce a little myself at home. I don’t really have the time to make it to a gym to work out in the way I am familiar, and I don’t really want to be around other people in a place that encourages spread of virus/bacterium.

I am not familiar with working out at home, and have limited materials.

I have been basically doing 4 day, trying to work on specific areas with the equipment I have (very minimal) and I am looking for some variety, or organisation of activities to maximise benefit whilst not increasing time. 

Equipment:

* Skipping rope
* Push-up handles
* Resistance bands (reasonably high max load)
* Dumbbells (you know the York ones in a box, not high max load)
* Recently bought a rowing machine (identical to a c2 - stoked on this tbh)
* Yoga mat

I’ve basically been rowing 30 mins a day (no skipping) or 15mins rowing and 15mins skipping depending on how I feel (side note I hate running, but sometimes run 5k), along with targeting - Chest/triceps, back/biceps, Shoulders/core and Legs

I am wondering if anyone could help me to:

A) provide me with some variety using the materials I have 

B) help to suggest exercises to help with getting bored doing the same thing/suggested exercises or muscle groups to target on specific days",SSJ4LYF,self.Exercise,1603323805

Exercise,How long does it take to develop ab muscles so they are visible?," 

ok so first things first: please do NOT tell me about the balance between weight loss and muscle growth. That does not answer my question at all. I strictly want to know how long it would take someone to make their abs noticeably larger.

For example, if someone were to go from the right picture to the left picture, how long would it take. [http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg](http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg)

(and please don't tell me the time it takes depends on the quality of the training either. I want advice that's actually helpful...)

I've heard that abs can be trained every day so let's assume we're doing an ab workout every day and eating protein in amounts somewhere around 0.8g/lb bodyweight and in a slight caloric surplus (250 kcal). yes i know it depends on the person but i just want a ballpark number. all the answers online are so useless and say cop-outs like ""everyone's different"" or ""you have to lose fat to see abs"" and they never even attempt to answer the question.

Exercise,How to motivate to work out in the morning?,"Hello everyone! First post here so sorry if anything is off.

I always worked out in my life, because I have a back problem and depression, so exercises helped me relieve my back pain and helped me stay happy. However I did pilates in a group of 4 people from 12 to 20 years old, and from 19 to 21 I started belly dancing classes and zumba, and I realised only then I didn't like working out with other people, so I quit everything and started working out alone at home. Everything was perfect until the pandemic came.

Before I woke up early, did my exercises (just dance, wii fit and solo workouts, varying each day), took a shower, breakfast and went to college/work. There were days when my laziness got the best out of me and I slept until I couldn't, but most days I was happy with that routine.

Now everyday seems a huge effort to get out of bed to do the exercises. I sleep until few minutes before class/work and eat breakfast while watching the professors and working. I really need tips on how to get motivated again to wake up early and do my routine. I'm starting to gain weight and I really don't want that after all my effort last year.

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: I used to wake up early every morning to work out but now in the pandemic I stay in bed until minutes before class/work. How can I get motivated again? Thanks in advance",EeveeNagy,self.Exercise,1603283395

Exercise,Are 15-25 minute HIIT workouts on my exercise bike enough to lose weight?,"Hi all. I’m 23 and have been majorly unhealthy the past few years of my life since I started university up until now. Last week, I said to myself enough is enough, I hate my body (I’m not a big guy but certainly “overweight”) and my mental health was terrible due to no exercise and junk food over the years.

For the past week and a half, for the first time in a long time, I’m feeling good. I am doing 15 to 25 minute HIIT workouts on my bike and cooking actual meals MOST of the time (i have had a day or two of takeout junk food, my major addiction) - but I am mostly eating pasta with veg and chicken on the daily basis. 

My concern is, am I doing this all wrong? Am I going to be seeing no progress if I continue to do these exercises everyday? I get overwhelmed easily with all the numerous articles online stating it’s not enough exercise and I’m eating all wrong, but some say it is the right amount to lose weight.

Exercise,Problems with exercising,"I am new to exercising. F24 and i'm pretty thin bordering on underweight i've always been this way no matter how I eat so I have started exercising to at least build some muscles. I always get problems whenever I try to exercise in the periods I have tried. I've gone to the physical therapist my fair share of times and gotten exercises from him because I suffer from overpronation. I have had shin splints three times, the last time (a year ago) it got so bad I had it for 5 months and needed ultrasound treatment because nothing else worked. I get shin splints easily, I had only gone on walks then. My mother suffers from arthritis, for many years they told her she doesnt because it wasnt visible on x-ray yet and  now its gotten to a bad point and not until then have they said she has it. I have asked doctors and my physical therapist if I could have it but they say its impossible due to my age. The reason im wondering is because maybe its a reason why I get so much pain in my joints when I do certain things and maybe then I should exercise differently.

Now when i've exercised i've first started experiencing hip-problems on the right side. I've only done mild exercises, stretched too and nothing intense at all. Yet after like 2 weeks my hip started snapping whenever I lift my leg so now I cant do many of those exercises. At first there was no pain with it but now there's soreness in my right hip that comes and goes randomly. My thighs are sore too and feel very weak even though i've rested for like a week now, it just started hurting as soon as I try to do ONE squat. It feels painful right above my knees and the whole front of my thighs hurt. It even hurts to stretch them. And i've started experiencing back pain and shoulder pain since I started exercising those body parts which I also do very carefully and now I haven't done it in like 2 weeks or more but it still starts cramping randomly. My back hurts when I walk. I don't know if that has to do with my overpronation or if it's something with my back itself.",lilybaeby,self.Exercise,1603199603

Exercise,"Doing planks on a stretchy, rubbery mat?","**TLDR** what kind of exercise mat is best for planks?

Currently doing 45 second planks, and just started doing 17 seconds side planks. 2 sets.

Problem with the side planks, is that I yelp in pain whenever I try to support my weight with my left elbow on my hard wood floor. I don't know why, but it's been the case whenever I've tried to do it, which is for about six weeks or so. Just seems that that part of my body is particularly sensitive. 

**So I've had to resort to using this cheap, rubbery, stretchy mat that my aunt gave me. Problem with that is I can feel it stretching beneath my feet and forearms while I'm planking. **

Does this reduce the effectiveness of the exercise, given that it's probably forcing me to change my posture while I plank? If so, I obviously need to invest in a better mat. So what kind of mat should I get for planking?",DefamedPrawn,self.Exercise,1603085321
Exercise,Can anyone make any recommendations to my following exercise routine?,"Hello! I would first like to note that I am new to exercising and my goal is to lose as much belly fat (I'm around 20-25% and weigh 135lb)as I can and increase my weight. I would also like to build muscle throughout my body with the limited equipment I have.   


My first question is the right/amount of food to eat? I would say that I eat similar to the average person with the exception of breakfast as I go for brunch. This may vary from pasta, meat, etc. Dinner is 100% rice mixed with mincemeat. On the side I drink a little water, 2 canned coke zeros, and milk.   

As for my exercise, I exercise every day mostly on cardio. It is before dinner where I start off with this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sEeVJEXTfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sEeVJEXTfY) and then hit the treadmill for around 45 minutes (usually the first 10 is just walking) and end my exercise with the same video above. I also ride my bike on occasions depending on the weather, it's getting colder outside so I don't go out as much as I used to.

Exercise,"Is 10minutes 4x a week enough of a starting routine for someone really out of shape? (For my bf, a 31 m)","My (25f) boyfriend (31m) hasn’t exercised in years due to back/health problems, and wasn’t super active apart from biking/skating before that. He’s really underweight and is challenged by 10 minutes of very basic exercises- (jumping jacks, dead bugs, hip hinges, squats.) His nutrition is really poor and he smokes.

I want to help him come up with a safe exercise routine so that he can build endurance, strength, and kickstart other healthy habits so he feels good. He doesn’t like feeling out of shape either and wants to make these changes. 

After a while the idea is to increase the exercise time and maybe see a doctor to do a full health evaluation, so for now, is it enough to do 10 minutes of the very basics until he can get through that? Should he do 10 minutes of basic exercises and follow it with a walk? Is it enough to start feeling a change after a month? 

He is the nicest guy and I really want him to experience feeling physically healthy and prevent any health problems now or down the road. I’ve played competitive sports my whole life so I also don’t want to push him too hard too fast. Thanks for any input!!

TL;DR: Is 10 minutes of very basic exercises done 4 times a week enough to start feeling a difference in someone who hasn’t worked out in years?",Buff-Pup,self.Exercise,1602979849
Exercise,Exercising your glues....when you have damaged/injured knees?,"Put simply, I have a very bad case of man pancake butt that I want to work on to give it some shape...the problem? My knees. I won't go into overly detailed, but my knees (left primarily) took some major damage in my mid 20s and now (33) they are 100% out of commission when it comes to anything like Squats or pretty much anything involving heavy pressure focused on the knee(s).

So with that in mind...what other exercises are available to me that can provide heavy work outs to my glutes that do not depend on heavily using your knees? Pretty much every work out routine I read up on for glutes involves things like squats, barbell lifts, step ups, and such. All of those are 100% out of the question for my body.

Exercise,Motivation.,"I don't know if this is a good motivator or not, but I finally decided that im just going to do cardio. I will not seek to lose weight, gain muscle, endurance, or anything. The reason being is because I always find a reason why I can't. You have to exercise at the right time, after you eat, but you have to wait a certain amount of time after eating so you can avoid bloating or something. But there are too many interruptions within that 30-45 minutes that you are waiting. You get asked to to to the store, your younger siblings want to hand out, bla bla bla. So finding time is difficult. I also worry if I'm doing the exercise right. I may think im doing it right but no my pelvis needs to be in a certain position. Because it wasn't, I did the exercise for nothing cause now I'm not going to get the correct results. 

So now, I'm just going to get my heart rate up. That alone is good and healthy enough. Exercising like that is better then not doing it at all. I don't even need to lose weight. I'm healthy for my height. I was just hoping to tone up. But the regulations and strict guidelines keep me from it. So again, I'm just going to exercise for the heck of it. 

That's a starting point anyway.",Not_For_Anyone,self.Exercise,1602875034

So I'm thinking about buying her a machine for her to start moving within her house, and rest when she needs. I've thought about a treadmill so she can at least walk, then gradually increase the time she's on it. But there's other options like stationary bike, or elliptical.

Exercise,Am I going about losing weight correctly?," 

This might be a bit vague and unreasonable as well, but I wanted some advice. I have been working out pretty consistently for the last 3 weeks. I work out Sunday through Friday for about 1-2 hours. I do strictly cardio. Right now, its been exercise bikes on high resistance, 30 minutes on a stairmaster at about 60 steps per minute, but occasionally lowering it because I can get pretty tired. I also started using a rowing machine this week, and I like it. I also tried lifting weights for probably the first time in my life a couple days back, and I really pushed myself and felt awesome about it, but I have been SORE as hell the last two days so I haven't done it again yet. I likely will tomorrow.

Anyways, I am working out to lose weight so I can join the military. I started at 232 pounds, started dieting about 2 months ago, and working out the last two weeks. I am now at 218ish(it fluctuates by a couple pounds). I am trying to lose the weight as quickly as possible because I hate my lifestyle right now and have wanted to join the Army my whole life but never really did anything about it. So I have the following questions:

1)Is strictly cardio a bad idea? Should I also include muscle exercises regularly throughout the week?

2)Is doing cardio OTHER than running a bad idea? Will I find it easier to run the more cardio I do that ISN'T running, or do I need to run?

3)Is six days a week too much to work out? I have heard that I need recovery days so I picked Saturdays.

4)My heartrate will occasionally hit 190BPM and very rarely a little bit higher when I am pushing pretty hard. Is this dangerous or natural for my weight and inexperience?

That's about it. I know it's a lot. Any help would be much appreciated, and any extra advice as well. Thanks!",BogusMachineElf,self.Exercise,1602715414

So, I'm interested how accurate is that. I know that it's not as it shows, because it doesn't consider my age, sex, weight and height. 

Today's example, according to my bike, I cycled for 58 minutes, I crossed 28.5 kilometers and burned 650 kcal. That means my speed was 29.5 km/h (18.3 miles/h).

Exercise,What exercises should I do with two dumbbells at home (beginner)?,"I powerwalk on asphalt (no alternative where I live), for 45 minutes every day. When I get home, I am very tired and all I have access to is two 5 kg. dumbbells (with the pandemic and all).

I would, please, like some advice on exercises I can do daily. I used to work out, but have not for a long time. It has to be daily, or else the risk of me stopping again is too big - has to be routine, same sets at the same time, ever - single - day! :)

I would like to work on my pecs, biceps and shoulders. Do as little as possible in the beginning, but still be able to see some results after a while.

Does anyone have any tips on what I can do daily?

Exercise,How to exercise at night,"So I've gotten a bit chubby, I really want to lose weight. I find biking incredibly fun so I often go on bike rides. However I am EXTREMELY self conscious, so I like to go out and exercise when it's dark so nobody can see me. Last night I went to an empty parking lot and just rode really fast and did some loops for about 30 minutes to an hour. This seems to be the best way for me to exercise. However I'm not really sure how efficient it is. Is it too late to burn all of the calories I've gotten throughout the day? Should I be eating a snack before going out? My primary goal is to lose weight, I couldn't care less about my health. So if the way I'm going about it won't have me losing weight then there's no point. I just need to make sure that I'm not just wasting my time.

Exercise,Knees cracking and crunching and hurting with any leg exercise,"
23F- healthy BMI

Every time I do squats even with no weight my knees crack and crunch and then are in pain for a few days after. They hurt more than the burn of the squat!  And the sound and thought of them cracking really puts me off the squats too even if the real pain doesn’t come until afterward.

Since I was about 10 years old my knees have clicked every single time I straighten / bend my knees while lying or sitting down without fail . It’s impossible for me to straighten or bend my knees without them clicking. Idk if that’s relevant lol

Any help is Appreciated as although my weight is fine I’m a very physically weak and unfit person , I want to start some light exercises but this problem is putting me off doing anything at all except abs exercises and even then my knees will play up when I do the leg raises etc.

Exercise,Help me come up with a long term plan to get healthy,"Hi everyone, please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on.

I have been unhealthy for quite some time now (no exercise and eating a lot of fast food). I have decided it's time to change. I have tried to start working out many times before. Every time I try, I tell myself I will take it easy in the beginning so I don't get burnt out, but when I am nearing the end of my first work out I think ""fuck it, I am already working out, might as well push myself as hard as I can"", and I do so, but then I am completely unmotivated to keep going the next day, and just quit.  I am in no hurry to get a shape, I just want something that will keep me healthy in the remaining approximately 60 years of my life (I am 20f). So, I had the idea to start with something ridiculously easy the first day, but make it harder over time. An example would be to do 1 push up a day on days 1 and 2, and every other day I increse it by 1, so in a years time I would be doing more than 175 push ups a day, and I don't see how I would end up quitting. I can for example set a maximum, and once I hit that maximum I will stop increasing it. I am interested to see what peope think about this plan, and any tips you have. I have some specific questions as well:

1. Should I focus on just one thing like push ups, or should I have some variety? For example, let's say on a particlar day my ""number"" was at 30, then I could do 15 push ups and 15 sit ups for example.
2. Is it important that I spend some time in the beginning before starting figuring out how to do these exercises with the correct form? At the moment I am pretty much clueless about form for push ups, sit ups, etc.
3. Which exercise, or exercises, would you recommend I do? I don't have any specific goals like building muscle or anything, I just want to make sure I don't die early haha
4. What is a suitable maximum? I realise of course this depends on which exercise or exercises I choose to do
5. Should I take break days? Or perhaps days where I do less than usual? For example rather than going 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 23, 23, 24, 24, etc. I could do 20, 10, 21, 10, 22, 11, 23, 11, 24, 12 etc.
6. I would prefer to pick something that is easy to just knock out whenever I want, like for example while I am cooking I could knock out a few push ups, then later in the day I could do another few, etc. Will it be fine to spread it throghout the day rather than doing it all in one session?

Exercise,What is your internal motivation to exercise?,"Recently, I realized that I was only so fit prior to this year because of external motivation: wanting to look good at events, look good for potential dates, be a certain weight just for the sake of being ""skinny"", wanting to be fit because I'm in the medical field and I have to walk the walk,  and exercising so that I can be healthy for my loved ones.  

Now for the past 8 months I haven't gone on a single run and have 0 motivation to do any type of exercise. I love the way I look, feel confident, am medically healthy, but I need to exercise the same way every person alive should exercise. Tried Orange Theory, home yoga, home HIIT, and nothing sticks. I can't even go on a short walk. Everything is good and happy with my home life, but I'm desperate to find a spark and love for exercise.

Exercise,Becoming exhausted very early in workout,"Hi everybody,

I work out in my condo using a set of adjustable dumbbells and body weight exercises. I do pretty much only weights and zero cardio.

I find that during my workouts, I become completely exhausted to the point I feel I cannot continue within the first ~ 20 minutes of working out.

For example, today I did 10 sets of goblet squats with varying amounts of weight (body weight to bodyweight +50lbs), 3 sets of bodyweight lunges, and 2 sets of Bulgarian squats. By the time I was done all of this I felt sick to my stomach which seems unusual because it took me all of 25 minutes. I had to stop and go shower cause I didn't think I could do another squat.

I was wondering if this could indicate a deficiency, poor cardio health, or something else. Thank you for any information.

Exercise,I need your help getting started in exercise,"Pretty much the title..Hello everyone, hope you are doing well!

I'm going to post a little background about myself and my fitness goals. I'll also post my concerns and what's holding me back from starting. Any advice for some or all of the categories will be greatly appreciated. Here goes:

What: I want to start with a realistic fitness goal.. nothing over the top. Probably 30 minutes for 4-5 days a week (as I imagine rest days are needed). I want to do a multiple, different exercises (a program, for example push ups, stretches of some sort, followed by lunges..I don't know) that require NO equipment (except the floor and walls). I also prefer to exercise alone. Speaking of no equipment...

Where: I prefer to do my exercises completely at home..hence, no gym equipment. The park is ok as well when the weather is nice. I just don't like gyms: the distance, the ambiance, the cost, the sweat on the equipment, thinking about where to store my stuff, the people (I'm somewhat antisocial..Hur Hur), it just does nothing for me.

How: This is where I need your help. I need your help as to which ""equipmentless"" exercises I can do at home. Perhaps 3 or 4 different types that I can do in a row for a grand total of 30 minutes?  

Desired result: I don't expect nor desire to be jacked (like the stereotypical bodybuilder). I suppose I want a lean or somewhat toned look if that makes sense. I'm currently skinny in both the arms legs (with legs being much stronger). I have a very slight gut, but I want it to be a least flat. In the end, I want to feel more energetic and stronger in the upper body/arms  (though I'll train the lower body too obviously). I'm a guy in his mid-twenties for context.

My experiences with exercise: My experiences have ranged from meh to mediocre/indifferent at best. In high school and college, I have tried various weight training programs with little reward. While I've achieved short term results while I was in enrolled in such programs, I wouldn't go back to the gym when the mandatory programs ended. I don't know..I just didn't enjoy using weight training equipment..I liked how I felt afterwards sometimes yeah..but it always felt like a chore . The coronavirus also doesn't encourage me to go to an enclosed space where everyone is rapidly breathing..no thanks.

Conversely, I plunged myself into Tai Chi for a short period and really enjoyed it. The reason I don't do it now is the lack of a structure or teacher (and being lazy).

The only current exercises I do regularly is long walks (everywhere..I have no car). I also stretch..but only for a few minute intervals when I need to feel better (after working on my computer for a while).

Things holding me back:

1) Too many choices and conflicting information: The number of exercises available is numerous. Worse still, the advice that follows is of often confusing and conflicts with other advice. Looking this shit up is mentally taxing. I'm also confused by the various definitions, methods, blalabla.

2) Diet modifications: I typically eat in moderation and avoid junk food..no problem there. I'm mostly concerned as to how much stuff I have to ADD if I start working out. Do I need to learn new recipes? How many servings of this or that? Do I simply add protein to the dishes I already know? Should I drink a protein powder (which is often expensive)? Ugh..

3) Lack of structure: I don't want to go to a gym.. maybe I can read your exercise suggestions and search them on YouTube. I don't want to half-ass it without knowing if it's getting me to my fitness goals or not. I also want suggestions for how many reps or sets for each exercise if possible.

4) I don't enjoy it: I'm trying to change this attitude..tai chi gave me this sense of hope. Perhaps other ""equipmentless"" exercises can do the same. I see the benefits, have genuinely enjoyed it a bit before..and wish to take the plunge. 

5) Fear of improper training: Lastly I fear that I'll exercise ""unevenly"" if that makes sense. I don't want to focus excessively on one muscle area over another as I risk the injury and akwardness that comes from an unevenly developed body (hence those skip a leg day jokes online). I don't know how much time or what exercises to dedicate to which part of the body..hench the confusing and conflicting information that come from the fitness world.

Sorry for the long text..I just hope I was as clear as possible in my text. Thanks again!",Jida-polysavoir99,self.Exercise,1601711978

I’ve been running as my main form of exercise for quite some time now, but lately I’ve started to get this intense pain in my stomach after a few minutes. It started like two weeks ago, and after a few days of having to cut my runs short- I also started having breathing problems (also outside of running). It lasted until I got medicine for asthma (I have not been diagnosed with it, my doctor just gave me the medicine). So, yesterday I brought the medicine with me and everything went rather smoothly. I struggled to breathe, but there was no pain. However, today there is and I am once again unable to finish the run. It’s so annoying, and I don’t know what to do.

Exercise,How long should you cut?,"Hi there.

I have been cutting for last 9 weeks and I plan to do so for 3 more weeks. My body fat dropped to 15 percent. My target is low-to-mid 13 percent but I dont suppose I can reach that in 3 weeks. I am planning to go little aggressive on my diet for next 3 weeks.  I am so used to dieting now that I would probably not want to lose my leanness after 3 more weeks. However, at the same time, my gym performance is not improving for the obvious reason.

Is it a good idea to cut for more than 12 weeks when you have been able to reach 13-14% body fat and a good FFM with around 80 percent muscle mass?

And, how long should you bulk? Is 12 weeks an ideal time?

My plan right now is to complete my cut and then go with 2 weeks of maintenance and then start bulking.

Exercise,Is my diagnostic scale realistic?,"Hello, I am starting my weight loss journey, I rarely measure myself, and I don't want to focus on the weigh itself, but I still want to keep on track somehow. 
I thought of buying a diagnostic scale that measures body fat, bone mass, muscle mass etc. and mainly tracking body fat as that is what I want to go down. 

I bought one of German brand, so I assumed its good ahaha...

All in all I am 21F, weight 66.5kg with bf 29.8%, and muscle mass of 35%. Water percentage is around 51%. And in theory everything seems to be around average, except the body fat that I'd like lower, but I am not sure of the muscle mass? 

I am not sure if this is true to the state of my body, as I checked the ""average healthy stats"" online, and seems my muscle mass is in the ""high"" for women my age. I do think that I have pretty bulky legs (thighs and calves) since forever, but I don't exercise regularly tbh and I have no strength at all (I can lift heavy things like bags of animal food or cement etc and maybe carry them a few meters, but I can't do a single push-up for my life), although I did some weight lifting for 2 years like 3 years ago, but since then I did nothing. I have always eaten a lot of protein (meat, eggs and milk, as I live on a farm) so maybe that's another reason.

Exercise,"I experimented with a shorter, higher-intensity cardio workout today, and I’m not sure how I feel.","Around last week I started making a commitment to visit the gym regularly for cardio workouts. For most of it I’ve been doing mildly brisk walks (3-3.5 mph) on moderate inclines (2.5-4.5) for 60 minutes. 

Today I felt dissatisfied with how low my heart rate was, so I switched to 4 mph at inclines from 3.5 to 5, with longer “active” intervals and shorter “rest” intervals over a 25-minute period. I’m not fit, so 4 mph is a jog for me, meaning this was considerably more intense. 

My peak heart rate for this exercise was about 40 to 50 bpm higher than my 60 minute one, and my average heart rate was about 30 bpm higher.

I was satisfied with that, but I was unsatisfied with the fact that I couldn’t keep that pace up for longer than a minute or two, and had to lower the intensity in broken, irregular intervals—mostly because something is wrong with my left leg that makes it tired very quickly when walking or running. 

Because of this, I was left conflicted. I wasn’t sure if I was pushing myself too hard or if I wasn’t pushing myself hard enough. Though I was tired and sweaty after the session, I still felt like I could keep going, and wanted to, but I’m not sure if that’s because I actually could or if it was just runner’s high.

I’m not quite sure what to do going forward, and was wondering if any cardio enthusiasts had any advice. Should I lower the intensity? Increase the duration? Should I switch back to the 60-minute one for now? Should I cycle between them?",No_Mither_No_Problem,self.Exercise,1601140447

I have come here to receive a bit of advice. I have been overweight practically my whole life, and I have realized quite recently that I need to get my act together.

My request is that they are arthritis friendly, so no push ups, unless someone can help me with an alternative way to do them. I have a limited range of motion with my right hand (as in I cannot bend it back and it sits at a bit of a forward angle) and I am afraid of replacing the palms down with fists because of the lack of stability. 

Some exercises I have been trying at home (with the help of an app) are: wall sits, lunges, squats, curl ups, high steps(?), and planks. I also go on at least two walks a day (depending on if I work) that are about 40 minutes long each.

I dunno, haven't had health insurance for awhile, can't get health insurance because it's more than we earn, I've been on the waiting list for 8 months to see a doctor because there's only one cash pay doctor in town. Before all the other dumb suggestions roll in, yes, I have tried to get a job with health insurance. Yes, I live in the USA. Why yes, I do have a college degree. AND yes, I am moving to improve my situation, waiting on my immigration to Canada. No, my college degree isn't in the arts, it's in accounting. 

Now that all of that is out of the way, here's the deal. I'm trying to exercise, but, of course, my heart just seems to have a brisker pace. So, today, I did a very basic treadmill exercise, some inclines, but, never faster than 2.3 MPH and incline no higher than 12. So, beginner treadmill routine. I kept adjusting the speed down when my heart rate went over 185, but, one time I missed it and accidentally got to 202. I shut off the treadmill immediately and just walked very slowly around my living room until it came down into the 170s. 

For heart rate, I wear a Polar monitor, the basic chest strap version and the results are very similar to the fitbit I'm wearing. So, I doubt both of them are wrong. I can count my own pulse, but, obviously hard to do when it's that fast. lol

Anyhow, that's pretty much all I can do right? Is there a better guide for a safe number to aim for? I'm 37 if that makes any difference. I just don't want to accidentally die on the treadmill.",Jenniferinfl,self.Exercise,1601066799

Exercise,Losing weight,"Hello everyone!
I've always been a skinny guy. One day covid-19 came along and I couldn't leave my house for 3 months, because of this I did nothing but play video games and eat everyday. I am now 50 pounds heavier then I was and it has ruined my self confidence. All of my clothes are too small, and a lot of my weight went to my thighs and my butt, this makes it extremely hard for me to find pants that look nice on me. I've always been heavy into sports and I've always played at least 2 sports a week. This pandemic severely got me out of shape and I am struggling to get back into shape. I want to lose the weight I have put on, I've cut calories, started playing baseball again, and started jogging but it doesnt seem to be putting me back into shape, I just get beat out after about 20 minutes of jogging and then I feel like I can't do it anymore. I've lost about 4 pounds already but I'd like to see some faster results. If someone could please tell me how I can get to my goal it would be greatly appreciated.",LeFreeze-12,self.Exercise,1600972827

If I could find a site that does the whole X mile radius circle thing and also crosses over with google maps or a similar app so I can pick a point along the diameter and make it give me a route to my destination, that'd be perfect.

*I know it'd be really easy to pick a park with a mile long trail and walk it 5 times, or something along those lines, but it makes it really easy for me to quit because it's boring and tedious. If I'm 5 miles from home, work, or somewhere else I have to be, it's easier for me to stick with the exercise because exploring my city stimulates me and I'm already on my way home/to work/etc (happy mood), so all I have to do is just resist using public transportation.*",BlankImagination,self.Exercise,1600917027

Exercise,Clarifying the confusion,"I've been weightlifting for about 3 months now and watched several weight training YouTubers and read several related articles but seem to get conflicted results. I'll list them below and hopefully someone with experience and knowledge can clarify them up for me.

* Frequency of Training
   * Some articles and videos suggest training every single day for a fixed amount of days is perfectly fine. (i.e. Train 5 days straight Monday - Friday, weekends rest)
   * Other info states you must rest every other day (i.e. Lift MWF, rest TThF)
   * Same story with certain muscle parts (i.e. the biceps - the biceps are a small muscle group, which some articles have indicated that they can be trained every single day. Others have conflicted and stated they need more time to recover since they're small)
   * I personally do a full-body workout since I'm a beginner
* Eat Window and Protein Amount After Workout
   * The math on this one is all over the place. I currently weight 165 pounds. About how much protein do I need to intake after my workout?
   * Is it true that if you don't eat after a lifting session, you just wasted your time in the gym?
   * What's the window after you leave the gym to consume the protein?

These are the big concepts I'm still a little fuzzy on so people with knowledge and experience - please drop a comment. Thanks!",Newyorkntilikina,self.Exercise,1600875880

Exercise,Treadmill adventures,"Hi. First time poster here. I am a 61 yr old woman, who, until recently, lead a very sedentary life. I owned an elliptical for year, used it rarely, and hated it every time. I finally sold it and got a treadmill. 
Since getting it over a month ago, I got the iFit app and have been using it religiously, only taking 1 day a week off. 
Recently, I've been doing a series of the Grand Canyon South Rim, down to the Colorado River, and back up to the top. I just finished part 9 of the series, and here is my take.
Today's interval training, going up the Grand Canyon, to the South Rim, from the Colorado River, was 19:46 minutes of pure sweat and hard work. It was an elevation gain of 219 feet, .86 of a mile, with an estimated calorie burn of 120. All of it was up hill, mostly a steep climb, in intervals of a normal walk, to a fast walk, 2/1 ratio. I did it though. I didn't slow down, or reduce the incline, but rather, was able to keep up with the trainer this time. It is part 9 of this series. I am not sure how many parts are in this series, but will continue for as long as I can, trying like hell to make it back up to the top.

I've read posts from other people doing 5+ mile hikes, and even longer and harder. But for me, someone who's barely exercised more than walking into the kitchen to get coffee, this is a huge thing. I've been doing this for over a month now, religiously, taking only 1 day a week off.

So far, my rounded total stats for my treadmill adventures are:

Total Miles: 41
Total elevation gain: 3,347
Total Estimated Calorie Burn: 4,401
Total Time: 16:19:08

Not gonna lie. I am proud of myself for changing my negative inner talk, only to once again fail. I am committed to continuing as long as I can, and making this a lifestyle of healthier living.

Exercise,Am I doing too many sets?,"I’ve been regularly working out since February and up until recently I’ve been happy with my results.  I’ve lost weight and increased muscle mass a bit.  In the past few weeks I’ve found that during and after some exercises I feel great, strong, and energized.  During others I feel exhausted and totally wiped.

I started doing some research and I think that I might be doing too many sets.  I’m pretty inexperienced when it comes to exercise, so as I progressed, I simply increased reps and sets.  Now I’m thinking that’s not necessarily the correct method to gain muscle.  My regular exercise routine is:

Jump rope x 120 - 5 sets
Push up x 25 - 5 sets
Sit up x 30 - 5 sets
Dumbbell bicep curls 30 lbs/arm x 10 - 5 sets
Double arm tricep extension 30lbs x 17 - 5 sets
Pull up x 7 - 5 sets

First off- I know I need to incorporate lower body exercises into my workout.  Jump rope isn’t enough.  I hope integrate that when I change the number of sets.  Second- am I correct in thinking that I should decrease the number of sets I’m doing?  

My goals are to increase strength, gain mass (I’m 5’10”, 132 lbs), and stay toned.  I’ve considered doing a couple sessions with a personal trainer to get a good routine down.  

How many sets should I be doing per workout?  Thanks for any advice or recommendations.",cpt___kidde,self.Exercise,1600375407

Exercise,Need some advice on weight loss and exercise,"Since 2016... I've lost 75kg... But during 2019 it started to stall and I only lost 5kg the entire year.

Since xmas and partly due to stress during the pandemic... I've gained 8kg.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few weeks ago I started walking 2-3 times a day... I can't do much as I have a spinal problem as well as a major problem with one knee and a pretty knackered ankle... old injuries from soccer when I was in my teens and twenties that mean I can't run any more.

&amp;#x200B;

I started out slow... half a mile would take me 15-20 mins and I'd do that twice a day. I'm now doing a mile in 15 mins.

&amp;#x200B;

I've slowly built it up over 4 weeks and had lost 2kg... then for some reason... and no.. not over eating... and after increasing my walking distance each week to 2 miles a day... I put it all back on in one week.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I've increased my walks even more... I'm averaging 2.5 miles a day now and at an average speed of 3-4mph

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm stuck at this weight and can't seem to shift any of it... My food intake is around the 1500-1800 calories a day mark, I'm drinking at least 1.5-2lts of fluids a day. My carb intake is probably a little higher than it should be... but I have some dietary issues and am unable to get the recommended 5 fruit/veg a day (only have 1/3 of a stomach left).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doing ten times more exercise than I was before... during lockdown I was eating all the wrong stuff... baking cookies, cakes and brownies... Stopped all that over a month ago... But I'm exactly the same weight I was 5-6 weeks ago in spite of eating less and exercising 10 times as much.

Exercise,Are glute bands causing my hip pain?,"Hey everyone! I've noticed recently since I got back to the gym 1.5 months ago that my right hip has been getting tighter and tighter and right now it's kind of radiating pain. My left side is fine. I'm flat footed but I'm able to hold my arches up when needed to ensure proper alignment. However when I go really deep the arches do start to collapse in (so my heels don't lift). My right foot is slightly more flat that the left. I have extremely long legs and a short torso so squatting is already kind of difficult for me to get right. 

my current lower body routine, not necessarily in this order (crowded gym I have to be flexible):  
\- leg press (high/wide stance, feet slightly pointed out)  
\- smith machine squats w/ glute band  
\- hip thrusts w/ weighted barbell and glute band  
\- cable kickbacks  
\- calf raises

So I have two theories, the glute band I'm using is pushing my legs to close together during squats causing them to twist inward OR it's the feet collapsing or combo. I've heard of thrusties causing hip problems too. Just curious if anyone knows where I should start so I don't make this any worse than it is.

Ive tried many times to be fit, but this time around I've done some actual research beyond ""good workout for biceps, calistentics"". Before I was doing like 5 or 6 random upper body exercises for 4 sets. Then the next day lower body/core. Then rinse and repeat for 6 days, taking sunday off. 

This didnt work, I wasnt tracking my progress, I had no idea what I was doing, no goal, no idea what exercises progress (like if I can do 5 million pushups, what's next?) When to add reps, sets, or move on to a more difficult exercise. Soon I became unmotivated, and I started doubting myself, thinking wow it's a month and a half and I see no results. Probably doing it wrong. 

I was impatient for sure, but I'm happy I was. I know I'm doing slightly better this time because my upper body exercises are split into Push &amp; Pull Days with the 3rd day being Core &amp; Legs. So Mon &amp; Thu Push, Tue &amp; Fri Pull, Wed &amp; Sat Core &amp; Legs. I was also running 3 miles on Wed and Sat.

My biggest issue right now is how much I'm struggling with (what feels like on paper) a small amount of exercise. 

My push days are 3 sets, 5 reps each as recommended by some fitness site.
Diamond Pushups, Dips, Pike Pushups, Decline Pushups, and Bench Dips. 

Pull is also 3 sets, 5 reps of Pullups, single leg deadlifts, chin ups, and upright prayer rows.

I started doing 5 of everything, and each week added 1 extra rep because I read progressive overload is important. However, I struggled doing this workout. Pretty much on the 2nd set I would start hitting failure at like 3 dips. After that I couldn't do any of my exercises completely. I'd stop half way, stretch my arms and barely finish. 

So my adjustment was to cut back everything to 5 and only add 1 rep to 1 exercise per week. And I started giving myself a 30 sec break to stretch my arms between every exercise. I still struggled so much, and it frustrated me. Am I just weak as shit? 

It annoys me because I feel like on paper my AB &amp; Core workout is the hardest. I do both in one session. 

Lower Body, 3 sets
15 Squats, 10 Glute Bridge, 15 Calf Raises, 15 Lunges, 5 Inchworm 

ABs 3 sets
25 Crunches, 45 secs Planks, 5 Knee Raise, 30 secs Russian Twists, 30 secs Plank Twists.

I feel so good doing these exercises. I sweat like crazy, I feel my abs burning, I reach a struggle each set (esp on the planks, last 10 secs my body shakes). But that struggle doesnt turn into failure. I'm progressing every exercise, and taking no breaks while doing a set. The struggle while being able to still finish feels like (in my head) what my upper body exercises should feel like.

TLDR - The difference in upper body exercise vs lower body/core. 

Upper Body - No momentum, constant breaks, once I struggle the workout declines so much its unmotivating, no progression being made because I can only do one set entirely correctly. Feel stiff but never sore.

Lower Body/Core - No breaks needed, get a good sweat, feel the muscles burning, feel sore after (for a couple hours, sometimes all day), feel good about myself once I complete it.

So what am I doing wrong? I cant go any lower in upper body exercises right? I'd be doing like 2 dips, 1 push up, lol do you even progress at that point? Any tips for me? Going into this I thought my core would be by far my weakest area.",RKTV11,self.Exercise,1600148571

I recently sustained a serious injury (knee, already operated on and many months down the line) and I'm annoyed at myself for not seriously thinking it through before.

I personally found all the standard health/activity trackers like the average sports smart watch, (android) health apps, etc seem to not have, say, a section that takes into account an ""unusual"" situation. i.e. injury or say if you're a regular wheelchair user, you may not have a proper ""step count"". And you couldn't convince me without serious evidence that crutch use isn't as, if not more, intense as walking! 😅

I imagine such apps may be off putting because they're designed for a person who is generally able-bodied. And the ones that connect to ""communities"" are also comparing you to majority able-bodied people, providing encouragement on the same basis.

Besides, my situation is temporary, what about those for whom injury or disability isn't? Are there apps that do? Maybe I'm not looking in the right places?

5""5.5 
Current weight: 178 
Goal: ~140 

((There's a TLDR at bottom if you don't wanna read a bunch))


So for a few months I've been walking on a treadmill for 30-45 min a day, and 3 weeks ago I made it so I walk an HOUR a day. I walk about 2 miles a day on my treadmill. 


I also am eating 1,200 calories a day. (I went to the doctor for a checkup and told her this- she had no issue with it. Don't worry). I've cut out most carbs and sugar, except for a very occasional toast or small serving of cereal. 


My mom said she doesn't want me to weight lift but maybe I can talk her into getting me some 5 pound weights so I can build some muscle? The gym isn't too far but my family is always busy so its not like she can just take me there every day. 


About a year ago I got an ultrasound on my throat to see if I had thyroid issues, and I also got blood work done. Both the blood work and ultrasound came back fine even though my neck looks big and I have issues losing weight. A few of my family members had issues so I easily could have them. (I'm saying this just so you know it might be harder for me). 


How do I lose weight super fast??? I literally hate my body so much even though I'm not even 200 lbs. I want to be skinnier every second of every day and it just makes me so upset. 


Obviously nobody can give me real medical advice. I just need basic info..

Exercise,I have very little motivation whatsoever to exercise and my body is suffering from it.,"I’m 41 and a male. Former college soccer player at a high level school and stayed pretty active up until a few years ago. Especially lately, I have no motivation. I golf a few times a week but ride in a cart (just bought a push cart to try). I have pretty bad lower back issues (have had epidural steroid shots) and it makes a lot of activities impossible to do. I always hated exercising just to exercise. Like running at practices... Put a ball in my hands or at my feet and I’ll go until I’m falling over. But just exercising to exercise sucks. Even now I have a small tear in my shoulder and doing simple rehab for 45 minutes is so tough to wrap my brain around. And my body is getting worse because I don’t stay active enough...

So my question is, what do I do? Just try out walking for golf? My wife is a hardcore fitness girl and boxes, walks, runs, bikes, etc. 5 days a week. I go on a couple mile walk with her once a week and I hate every second of it. I am not working much in the past year or so but am fortunate to have good income from real estate.

It is mostly body weight exercises (isometric/calisthenic) and daily walking as I have very bad joints, but still I have been really happy with the visible results and have toned up all over. Except for the area above and below my belly button, the very middle of my abs. It seems to be just a loose layer of fat I just cannot get rid of, when I do push-ups with core tight it actually hangs down a bit and is really embarrassing. I know there's no such thing as spot targeting but I would welcome any tips or moves that may help. As far as my diet, I have eliminated caffeine, alcohol, added sugars, white/simple carbs, most gluten and dairy. I have done so slowly while listening to my body as I have always had complicated digestive issues and these changes are helping greatly.

Exercise,Bouncing back after a cardiac episode,"So about 2 months ago, I (34F) had some kind of cardiac episode that my heart rate spiked to 180bpm+ while I was driving and I had to pull over and have and ambulance take me to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. I see a cardiologist, have had bloodwork, ekgs, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, and even wore a monitor for a month, coming up empty and no sign of any issues. 

I was the type of person 2-3 years ago that I would be in the gym before work 3-4 days a week, watching my diet, lots of walking, great shape. With Covid now changing my lifestyle severely in the opposite, if I take more than 1,000 steps in a day, it’s an achievement. I work at a computer and try to walk laps through my tiny apartment just to keep moving. I have a suspicion that’s the root of my cardiac episode. 

My query to all is this: how to work up to where I used to be. Doc said I can go out walking, but I find that the heat spikes my heart rate and I start feeling sick and it’s not even that hot out. I want to push through but I also don’t want to keel over and get carted to the hospital again before my next check in with the cardiologist. Any recommendations on how to proceed? I know, seek medical advice, next cardiologist appointment is in 2 weeks so it’s on the list of things to discuss. Not sure if there’s anything I could be doing in the meantime to get me back on track to improving heart health.

Exercise,Please recommend exercises for someone with a bad knee.,"My mom is 64 and has hypertension. She could afford to lose 20 pounds, but has a busted knee that is holding her back.

She has full control of her knee and it flexes well, but has fluid in her knee due to busting something in there. We live in Spain and the doctors are telling her she’s still too young for knee surgery (I don’t know what the hell they’re waiting for; a miracle?).

When we go out for walks she starts to experience pain in her knee around the ten minute mark. She’s a fighter through and through so you won’t hear her complaining, but I know she’s in pain. She has developed a bit of a limp due to this.

She does enjoy going out on bike rides. However, we use the city’s electric bikes because they’re softer on her knee, so I don’t know that it’s really putting a dent on the weight loss since it’s mostly riding for leisure. I know any bit of activity is good, but she only gets to ride on her free days as she does 24 hour shifts at the clinics she works in. At work, she isn’t on her feet all the time, and she isn’t busy all the time, she’s just on call for whatever patient needs tending to. This gives her plenty of free time to do SOMETHING in her private room to keep her weight under control.

Yoga and running are mostly out of the picture, as most of the poses put a lot of stress on her bad knee and my mom wouldn’t be able to kneel for child’s pose much less assume a table top position or transition to downward dog; and running or walking would just aggravate her knee even more.

Swimming is a nice option but again, I need to show her something she can do every day and not just on her free days. 

My main goals for her are: weight loss and avoid further aggravation of the busted knee.

I love my mom and I want to see her get better. Losing weight would also lift her self esteem and she deserves to feel happy about herself.

If anyone here can recommend any exercises that can work around her limitations I’d appreciate it very much.

I'm talking I have to stop and scratch my legs so much for it to go away and I honestly have no idea why it happens.

The symptoms often do get slightly better if I keep the exercise up but it's always still there. I am not sure whether it's a blood circulation or problem or funnily enough, have an allergic reaction to working out? (sounds insane, I know)

When I started working out at 24, I was a legit skeleton. Barely even weighed 140 back then. Over time, I bulked up. Went to the gym 3-4 times a week for a long time, and it worked well. I’m happy with my body right now.

But I definitely want to improve. I’m confused what to do. I’d like to weigh more, 5-10 more lbs would be ideal. But I’d ALSO like to lose a bit of fat in my stomach so that my abs show through more.

How exactly do I go about gaining weight as muscle, while losing fat around my abs? I’ve been told by a lot of people to eat a ton, and that it doesn’t matter what, because my metabolism is so fast. But I feel like that’s definitely going to keep a bit of fat around my abs.

I really want to focus on arm muscles and abs, but people told me that you need to train every (important) muscle group, because it’s better for you. I didn’t want to do leg, chest, back, shoulder exercises but I still did it of course.

Now I do 20 minutes arm exercises, 40 minutes abs exercises, 20 minutes leg exercises and 15 minutes shoulder/back/chest exercises a week. (Almost every shoulder, back, chest exercise is an exercise that also trains arm muscles so yea)

I'm wondering what there is that he can do without putting tons of strain on his arms, I suggested he starts with really light weights to gradually break him in to it but I'm not sure if that's good advice. We will not be going to a gym, so needs to be stuff we can do from home.

Exercise,"Advice for helping my daughter (14F) get back into better shape (goal = STAMINA, not weight) for when swim season starts in a few weeks?"," So she was out of the pool from late March through mid-July, and like the rest of us, was a bit of a lazy slug. Got out of conditioning, put on 8-10 pounds. Coach found a local pool in a park they could use, and so they resumed practices for 4-5 weeks in mid-July through a couple of weeks ago, plus we started watching more what we were eating, and she did lose a few pounds (She is right now about 5' 6.5"", 130 - she was about 135). But that pool closed a week or two ago. So we started jogging

My daughter goes back to swimming in a few  weeks, and Coach has demanded that all the girls keep a regular exercise  regimen, so I'm having her do short distance running: miles and  5Ks. Problem is, she's a bit out of condition, and she has no real technique/form for running. I don't even know how to give her a good pre-run stretch routine, or how to monitor if what she is doing is  optimal in terms of pace, stride, and minimizing the impact on her  knees, hips, and back. 

She  did a 5K three days ago, and she was miserable the last 1/3 of  it. Like wailing in discomfort. But to her credit, she did not stop and  never slowed to a walk, and she ended up with a not-great-but-not  terrible time (average about a 10:40 mile, I think it was around 32:57 -  I'd like to get that down below 30:00, preferably below 28:00, which  would be a 9-minute mile pace). She said her chest was hurting, she had trouble breathing, she kept feeling like she was going to puke, towards the end anyway. She got some side stitches, but those went away. I was happy-ish with her 32:57, because 5 months ago, I had her run a 5K just to see if she could still do it (I figured for a competitive swimmer, it would be easy) but she ran a dismal 35:31. So I was happy with the big improvement the other day. 

The day before yesterday, I took her out  for a mile - which I figured would be super easy -  and she clocked a not-so-hot, but decent for her, 8:44 (if I  remember correctly). And again, she struggled with pain. of course, she was not pacing herself as gently as she tried to do for the 5K, but she can swim 400m (500y), so I figured jogging a mile would be a breeze. I guess not? 

I mean... Her  times are decent times for a kid off the street, but not for a  competitive swimmer who needs stamina. So I need (she needs) an expert's  help 🙂

She has never enjoyed exercise, and she doesn't even enjoy swim practice all that much. She is the typical teen with multiple devices and distractions, and would be a couch potato if I didn't threaten her to get off her butt. Today I told her to get ready for her run, and she plopped down on her bed and played dead. But I know that most of it is because her stamp is such that she knows, going into each run, that it will be unpleasant.

Exercise,Advice on building up conditioning,"Well, I’ve always been a big person, in 2014 I lost like 150~ pounds (and I was still big) but because I was working jobs that were on my feet the whole time I felt like my conditioning was okay.

Now I’ve been in quarantine, I’ve essentially been in bed for the past six months. I’ve gained a pretty big chunk of weight back, but the toughest part is the fact that I can barely walk half a mile without being completely destroyed.

Exercise,Waist meausrments,"Recently it came to my attention that waist size is a good indicator of health, better than other things like body fat or BMI.

So  I am now monitoring my waist. I am 1.84 (at the higher end of 6'0'' but  feet and inches are less accurate than cm and ml). Blood work is  health, not cholesterol, muscle mass is ok (not a gym buff by any  means), and I do have a small beer belly which is expected for a 41 yo  man. The belly is more noticeable when sitting down but if you see me  standing you will say I am actually skinny.

Having  said all that my waist is 95cm which is on the border. I'm looking at  this one chart and they say a 6'0'' man can have a 75cm waist and be  healthy. I really don't think so. They will be deemed a freak if they  ever existed. This body frame simply does not exist (someone with 75 cm  waist and 185 cm high - the hips will be too narrow.)

My questions are:

\- how accurate are these charts?

\-  what is the best way to measure the waist? should I stand and suck my  belly a bit or maybe protrude it a bit? because no one, I mean no one 6  foot can have a 29 inch waist.",zenmate122,self.Exercise,1598618905

I've been going to the gym every day, I'm getting good at making music, I listen to ppl like Alan Watts and David Foster Wallace all day to help me understand my situation better. But with that greater awareness comes a deep well of inescapable sadness that sucks the life and energy out of me. Because the reason why I'm doing it all is for those around me. But the problem is that I am alone. And it's my fault that I'm alone. I've pushed everyone away because I've just been hurt by friends, family, and everyone else over and over again. But here's the real issue: my environment. No matter how much I improve myself will fix the world around me. Did you know our society is completely backwards? The reason our species can display such intelligence but also barbarism is because our development was easily won. The planet supports human life perfectly. Hunter gatherer tribes collected some crazy variety of nutrients that people nowadays don't get anymore. Agriculture was basically a stupid fucking idea which a few of the shittiest members of our species used to create capitol and enslave the rest of the world. Thats what we mostly are. Slaves to money and impulses and those are both controlled by very few people. There's no way to argue against that anymore. A few people have all the money in the world while there are others starving in the streets. And everyone else just tries to be content with what little they have. And all of it reflects in us. I spend most of every day working a pointless job making money for the few people who are literally killing the planet. And I come home to my sad mother. When I look in the mirror I see someone strong and beautiful and brave. And its going to waste because I also see a history of bad men. We're not lazy or stupid. We're strongly affected by the shitty actions of others who we have no control over. Our society is a deadly waste of time and it will end some day because of that. As will I and my role in it. The reason I know all of this is because, when I'm at my worst, the only thing that gives me strength is the chance to see all the people I love smile again. But I feel as though I never will. Because it would be my eyes looking at them. For clarity, I am an American.

I’ve never been a great runner (childhood asthma and being a “fat kid” never helped) and I’m not terribly strong in the grand scheme of things. I have until the 12th of September to get as much exercise as I can in before I have to run an obstacle course (total of 450 feet) involving a 5-foot wall I have to jump over, a 150-pound body drag, and other assorted items. I’m looking honestly for any advice regarding exercises I should be focused on for this task. I am currently jogging each day, doing “shuttle runs” and “suicides” to try to run faster/get my breathing better, and push-ups/pull-ups (I cant do many at all; maybe a handful). I’m doing very beginner yoga as a warm-up for stretching. I just want to give it my all for this test and I want to be ready. Any help is appreciated.",shadow_knight0,self.Exercise,1598289860
Exercise,"If my muscles aren’t sore after working out, am I still getting any benefits?","Okay I’ve been trying to find the answer online but there seems to be a lot of contradicting information, so I figured I would just post about my specific situation.

I’m super unfit. Well, I must be. I have a normal BMI, but before two weeks ago, I never used my muscles or my cardiovascular system for anything other than walking around the house. 

Then two weeks ago I started doing home workouts, mostly leg and butt exercises. The first time I did it, I was super sore for the next two days. On the fourth day, I did it again, and I felt only a little sore. After that I worked out my legs/butt every other day, and I haven’t really felt sore since. I haven’t added resistance bands/weights to my workouts, but I have increased the number of reps.

So, my question is, am I doing something wrong? Do I need to add resistance/weight already? It seems odd to me that my muscles would get stronger after only two workouts, especially since I consider myself very weak, so I feel like I must be doing something wrong.",MajesticKittyPaws,self.Exercise,1598284401

So, I' started eating healthy and working out from May. I have a history of eating disorder and PCOS ( I've been taking medications).

I've been patient all [along.](https://along.in/) In July, I had my periods for almost a month so I wasn't able to do much. I started on medication from august 4. And I've lost around 9 kg.

Okay now coming to the point, at the beginning of May I used to do a lot of cardio. Then, I slowly started doing resistance training with the resistance band, and Now I've finally got weights (5kg Dumbbells) and I'm loving it. I also walk 10k steps (one and a half hour). I try to do weight training with dumbbells for an hour. I try to eat around 1400-1500 a day. I've been very disciplined when it comes to my diet :)

when I was younger, I was SUPER fit and did all sorts of physical activities.  now I'm old (well, 30) and chubby, but I recently came to the realization that I still love doing jumping jacks and jump roping (and even pogo-sticking, if I could trust myself to balance), but I'm just too chubby to really enjoy those things.  the way my stomach flops around hurts enough that I give up pretty early on.  I keep thinking to myself, ""if i diet and lose a little weight, it'll be much easier to exercise!"".... but I've been yo-yoing with the same 30ish lbs for the past 3 years.  and then I get a depressed and eat myself back into my heavier weights and have to start all over again.


so I've decided to just start trying to add some exercise to my routine.  disciplining myself to do it every day is going to be a real serious challenge for me, I know, but it'll be a lot easier for me to  get motivated if it didn't hurt so much.  I know that it'll be hard work and I'll be sore, but if my belly (and boobs) could just stay in place a little while the rest of me bounced around I know I'd give it a better shot.


so I was wondering- does anyone have any products that they could recommend or tips to help my chub stay put while I exercise?  thanks for all your help!",ICanHazAdvice2,self.Exercise,1597966657

They say that as I eat 3,000 calories a day, running will use a lot up, so it'll be harder to gain muscle. 1 PT says that if I wanted to be active every day, I could go to the gym 5 times a week, and run once.

Do you think it is possible to expand the lung capacity through deep breathing?

I take as deep of a breath I can through my nose, then gradually add more and more air through my mouth by sucking the air in by the corner of my mouth, then shut the lips and swallow air down. This way I am able to fill the lungs up really full. When I can't fit any more I just keep it in for a while.

One could think this method would ""stretch"" the lungs out, or at least make them used to be filled up so you could maybe hold your breath longer or increase breathing capabilities during cardio etc.",Amund-Jaeger,self.Exercise,1597765042

Exercise,Will 50 push ups and a 1 minute plank a day for a month help define core/ upper torso and arms?,"Hey folks,

I (17M) am considering doing the above for 30 days to see if I can get some definition in my core/ upper torso and arms. As background, I am 1.82 metres tall and weigh 60kg. I am underweight, although not by much, and have never exercised like this before in my life. I am a pretty decent runner, and can run 5km no problem in about 20 minutes, no breaks. I started doing both exercises today, and got through 1 minute of plank no problem. I did 20 consecutive push ups in maybe around 40 seconds, and then took a 10 second break, did another 10 push ups, took another 10 second break, did another 10, and then took 20 second breaks and did 4 more sets of 5 push ups until I got to 60 push ups. All in I don’t think that’s too bad for someone who never does this type of exercise. 

So the question at hand. I am not asking for instant abs, or huge arms, my arms aren’t terrible as it stands, but they are not at all defined. I have a flat stomach, but again, not at all defined. So I am asking here if the above workout every day for a month or so would get me some definition in the mentioned areas, even if only a little, but still a noticeable amount?

Exercise,Grip Training,"I've gotten more and more into grip Training this year, while I thought my functional fitness training would aid in my grip strength I've learnt that to do more pull ups and to train myself up to the one arm fingertip plank I need to focus more on specific grip Training.

I'm not reinventing the wheel you can find everything online but haven't seen many posts on grip Training and forearm mass on this forum. 

There is a major advantage to having great grip strength, your grip is the last thing to go, ever shake hands with an older gentlemen and think damn are you shaking my hand hard on purpose ?? Take it easy. 

It also can help adding more reps to your pull ups and push ups, building up great strength endurance, or it can help with your jujitsu or wrestling.

Ever shake hands with a wrestler ? They are one of  most powerful athlete's out there. Alot of boxers back in the golden days of Jack Dempsey use to train grip/forearm  Training regularly, he was one of the hardest hitters of all time along with Rocky Marciano who put a boxer in a coma for awhile with his powerful punches.

This is something I wish I would of trained more when. I first started bodyweight training, but better late then never try not to rush through the progressions slow and steady wins the race 

Push guide 
First progressing 
Knee push ups on knuckles (pronated position) 
Knee push ups on knuckles (neutral position) 
Do 2 sets of 20 on each exercise, once you have comfortably completed all reps and sets go on to the  next progression 

2nd progression 
standing fingertip push ups
Stand against the wall with your fingertips extended 
For best results aim for a 3 second tempo while in the flexion position then press away. 
2 sets of 40 reps. 

3rd progression 
Vertical fingertip push up 
Put yourself in the pike push up position but extend your legs a bit further then a standerd pike push up see where your most comfortable extend your fingertips and proceed to do the pike push ups with your fingers extended. 
2 sets of 20 

4th progression 
Fingertip push ups on knees 
Standard push ups  elbows close to your body but again extend your fingers and proceed to do push ups 
2 sets of 20 

5th progression 
Fingertip plank 
Hold the plank for 1 min for 5 sets add 30 secs to your plank every week until you can get to 4 mins each plank 

6th progression 
One arm finger tip plank 
Hold as long as you can and build from there it's a very difficult feat to hold for a minute from here sky's is the limit for you.


pull progressions 

1st progression 
Standing row hang 
Best on a post hold the post with your fingertips and pull back griping the post with all your strength using your finger tips. Hold for 1 minute 8 sets 

2nd progression inverted/Australian row hang 
Hang for 2 minutes while keeping your body straight and core on 

3rd progression bar hang
Grip onto the bar and just hang once you feel your forearms starting to burn acivate your shoulders and bring scapula down just like a scapula pull hold for 2 minutes 6 sets 

One arm hangs 
Same as above but with one arm hold for as long as possible then switch sky's the limit when you reach this progression hey it might help you achieve the one arm pull up an extremely great feat to pull off 

Good luck

Exercise,I need help putting together a workout plan.,"I’m so lost. I literally understand nothing about fitness, weight loss, and building muscle, and I’m tired fo going back and forth looking at different exercise programs only to end up trying to figure it out on my own.

Over the last year I’ve bounced back and forth between different exercise programs recommended to me and my own plan that I made. And none of them have given me any results. 

I’m committed to my insane task of trying to lose body fat and replace it with muscle. But nothing works. And at this point I’ve lost motivation because what’s the point of trying something if the chances of it actually working are so low, especially for something so time consuming.

I know there are no guarantees when it comes to exercise. But if anyone has a suggestion for a weekly workout plan that reduces body fat and helps to build muscles, that actually does show results, instead of just wasting my time for 4 months. Then I would really really really appreciate it, because I’m tired of trying over and over to lose weight and getting no visible results every after months.

Seeing results in a short amount of time in really important because it keeps you motivated.

A rewarding thing to hear is when a client says they got a compliment from other people noticing their body changes. Although it's good to be toned, there's other benefits you'll get. Other areas of your life like work and leisure can improve.

When it comes to body toning, you're looking at working the muscles, getting your heart rate high, and keeping controlled meal sizes. The better you do and the more effort you put into doing these things, the quicker you'll see changes in the mirror.

Initially you need to be patient for a few weeks and put in the work. This is why I created my online coaching platform. It keeps you going in those first few weeks while you might not see changes instantly. This is the time that most people either give up, or lose hope, or put in less effort.

I track clients progress, and make sure they're completing the exercises with quality. My online platform and coaching techniques allows me to do this. And that's how you're going to see changes. You'll be energized to push yourself hard.

Right now I’m getting back into it, also bouta buy a pull up bar. Now my questions, am I doing enough? Cause it seems like i’m doing too less excercise to gain muscles. 2nd suestion: Is it good to (except for the sit ups) only do arm excercises? I only want to have much arm muscles but I dont really like working out on other parts of my body, right now I can still see some fat, I do want to NOT see much fat anymore if you know what I mean. Last question: Any of you guys have a good workout plan for me? I want to focus on arm muscles but also want to remove body fat.

Exercise,"Alright. My 66 year old neighbor, alone and very depressed thanks to covid, has never seriously exercised. My encouragement is a total disaster. She now feels no amount of exercise can help her, she's a lost cause, etc. Any idea's on how to shake her from this mindset?","That was a helluva question, sorry for the long explain. But I just mowed her lawn and am reeling from yet another sad conversation with her. She is the greatest person alive, she just is. Kind, sweet, giving, the neighborhood grandma.

She, I feel guilty writing this, but, does have a body of someone who has never worked out. If it didn't bother her, fine. But it does A LOT. She doesn't have muscle tone anywhere but is about 20 pound overweight. Her weight is steady.  And here's the kicker.  She's not trying to be a body builder. She just wants to tone up, feel stronger and, the major goal, to have energy and hang on to good health. But, nooo, she is 100% absolutely convinced her ""ship has sailed"", past of no return, all downhill from her. 

Here's my one and only plan I have come up with. A friend of mine, yes very young at 30, but said he would take her on for free (I'll pay him back somehow but he's just seriously a great guy, too. Very patience, not intimidating. They would be a perfect team). 

This turned into a rant. Sorry, guys, just want to help this wonderful person who does nothing but help others. I want her to feel healthy and strong, too. How do you change that mindset, though. She really thinks even a walk around the neighborhood would do nothing for her. Personal trainer? Or finding some role models her age that she could work out with (how?!). A walking group or something? 

It's so good she wants to take care of her body and then so freaking depressing that she is convinced nothing will work.  Now I feel helpless at a situation I know is not!

Thanks for idea's. It's sad to think people, like her, say ""fitness is for young people."" She needs it more than anyone, especially with the depression. I hate all this. Anyway, thanks again.",GawkerRefugee,self.Exercise,1596909829

During exercise my heart rate is anywhere from 130-160 but lately I’ve been experiencing post exercise panic attacks because I just started to look at my heart rate. When I wake up in the morning my heart rate is around 65bpm and resting during the day it’s around 75-80bpm. When I get home from my walks I’ve been seeing that my heart rate is still quite elevated, around 120bpm for the first hour then 100bpm the second hour. Is this normal?? Not knowing if this is normal or not causes me to have panic attacks which make my heart rate even higher and breathing quite difficult. It takes me about 20 minutes to calm myself down but then I find myself obsessively checking my pulse over and over again. Does anyone else experience this or have tips?

I, and my doctor, have concluded this hat I can no longer lift heavy weights, even lightweights can hurt with certain exercises. I would love to stay active and quite frankly I get depressed and more anxious without weights. I have been running for the past 6 months without it disturbing my back too much, which is so great.

Threads fraying and a hideous white material around the back pocket that they try to cover in the image. I wish I would have paid a little more attention. They supposedly offer a money back guarantee, but when I tried contacting them they just gave me the run around and then said they couldn't help me. They do not stand behind their product and there is no guarantee. My case was escalated to a manager and I never heard back from them. Terrible product. Terrible customer service. DO NOT BUY.

Exercise,Do you think mental health is related to physical health?,"https://herts.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/SV_6S9Ur3epRmyJZWd?Q_CHL=preview

Hi, I’m doing research for my PhD into how weight loss issues can affect mental health. I would really appreciate it if you could fill in this questionnaire which should take about 10 minutes. All the questions are multiple choice so it’s very easy to complete and you don’t need to to write anything. You’ll only need to give a first name and your answers will be anonymised. You can also withdraw from the survey at any time.

The more responses I can get the more accurate the data will be which is really helpful:) I hope this research will help to bring mental and physical treatments closer together which I believe can only be a step in the right direction.
Thank you for your time, Elvis

There is a history of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in my family.  I want to get myself back to a better place health-wise and I was going to start by just taking one short walk around the block per day.  But is that starting too small?

Exercise,I have been depressed and overwhelmed so I haven't been exercising since January,"I'm just here to ask for advice on many things so please comment even if for a small piece of advice:

I'm a very small (4'11) 23F and I haven't done any kind of exercise in a very long time. I notice the lack of exercise is affecting my mind and my body. I feel like lately my muscles are losing their strenght and power. Since I'm in a bad place atm it's been difficult to get motivated to exercise. For example, the only time I have to work out is in the mornings and I can't do mornings because I have trouble getting out of bed for that purpose.


My question goes in two categories:

* Which exercises are good to start to get more ""in shape"" without really leaving my home (bc of covid)?? I heard skipping rope is good.

* What is a good way to motivate myself to get out of bed and do exercise?? 

*I thought of a third question: any good online exercise programs or apps?

i get shoulder pain when doing bicep curls, i barely feel an ache in the bicep, i do feel the tightness though, but i barely feel much ache but a fair ache in the shoulder, not a jabbing pain just an ache. i also have done concentration curls but it still helps, no matter what type of bicep curl i do and how much i try to limit any form of shoulder movement, it still aches, any reason?

also i do shoulders a day before bicep, perhaps i should put bicep and shoulder day in one?

Exercise,Sudden active lifestyle = Blisters?,"So as the title suggests, I've suddenly become more active in my life for work. While not outright as active as most people would consider active, I've went from about 1K steps a day(for about 3 years) at most to putting in 10K a day at work to start a healthier lifestyle. 

In just one week I've found myself to get a large blister on my foot. I've never had problems with my boots and find them comfortable, until recently when walking. They're snug but with some wiggle room, and a friend who works in the oil field had suggested them as he wears the same brand.

Exercise,My 40 day weight loss transformation (200lbs-190lbs),"To give a little background I’ve been lifting for 6 years and seriously for the past 2.  During quarantine I wasn’t doing any home workouts and had zero discipline with my diet. I gained 15lbs during this time and once the gyms reopened I decided to lose the weight and get back into shape!

I worked out 5-6 days a week for 60-75 mins.  My workout routine was chest, back, shoulders/arms, and the legs.  I incorporated abs at the end of every workout and did 15-30mins of steady state cardio every other day. 

I was eating 2.2-2.5k calories everyday.  I focused on getting enough protein and consuming low calorie dense foods.  I didn’t really track macros but if I had to estimate it was 50-60% carbs, 30% protein, and the remainder was fats

Exercise,A change in perspective,"I used to be a really skinny kid. Like, 5'8"" and graduated high school at 140 lbs.

Then, I got really sad my first year of graduate school, stopped working out, started eating and lounging more, and ended up around 190ish when the second year rolled around. Now, my weight has settled in the low 180 range with pretty regular exercise.

I desperately dreamed of getting back down to the 165 I was at 22 because I thought that was the peak. Now, I'm back in the gym regularly again and I'm content with my weight. Changing the mentality to working out to get stronger, not slimmer or super lean and ripped has helped me tremendously. I feel a lot better, and a lot less pressure to lose weight. I'll be happy with wherever I end up weight wise, so long as I'm in decent shape when I get there (:",HipsterCactus,self.Exercise,1595950769

I've avoided exercise in the last 18 months because of this and now am feeling quite unfit and my asthma seems to be flaring up a bit (I'm on medication for this) which I feel is due to me being inactive and spending so much time indoors.

Hi, I’m doing research for my PhD into how weight loss issues can affect mental health. I would really appreciate it if you could fill in this questionnaire which should take about 10 minutes. All the questions are multiple choice so it’s very easy to complete and you don’t need to to write anything. You’ll only need to give a first name and your answers will be anonymised. You can also withdraw from the survey at any time.

The more responses I can get the more accurate the data will be which is really helpful:) I hope this research will help to bring mental and physical treatments closer together which I believe can only be a step in the right direction.
Thank you for your time, Elvis

My height is 1.83m (6”0), I started at around 90kg (198lbs) and I’m now 84.4kg (186lbs), I currently don’t see any change in my appearance since I started with him except with this numbers, we did try to check body fat percentage but he claims they are inaccurate some of the times and that we shouldn’t focus on them.

We meet at a local park for our workout and not at a gym, where he brings some equipment (t-Rex strap, an 8kg weight and mattress for some exercises).

My diet is compromised with the same meals every day in order to make it simple for me, I log them into the “MyFitnessPal” app and at the end of the day I send him a screenshot of the daily summary.

My diet

Morning:
- Salad (cucumber &amp; gamba)
- Egg
- Cottage (5% / 3%)
- Protein drink

Afternoon
- About 2 chicken breasts
- Couscous
- Kebab

Evening
- Sandwich (whole wheat bread &amp; yellow cheese)
- Tuna

This sums up to about 1800-2000 calories a day with amounts of protein 2 times my weight (170) as my trainer advised me to.

Now, because I don’t see any changes in my appearance, I’m afraid his methods aren’t working, so I would really like to hear others opinion on the matter.

Do you think the diet is ok?
Do you think (from the little I described) that I should already see changes in my appearance?
Do you think this types of workout (outdoor and not in a gym) is a good way to get fit?

Exercise,In search of inexpensive low impact workouts,"Hello, I hope this is the right sub to ask this? When I was 15-18 I pushed myself way too hard. I spent 20 hours a week on average weight lifting, running, swimming, dancing ballet, and playing a variety of sports with a group of other homeschooled people. Around 19 I stopped completely, because life and major depression got in the way. At 22 I gained over 100lbs in two years because of a medical issue that has sense been resolved, but the weight is still there at 27. Because I pushed myself so hard when I was younger, I now have nerve/muscle damage in my shoulders that doesn't allow me to raise my arms for very long or they get tingling/pain/numb fingers, and I have bursitis in my hips. You're not really supposed to get bursitis so young, my orthopedic said that this is most likley from jogging too much too often. I've been trying to loose weight through a diet recommended to me by a dietitian and my primary care. It's not working well, and I can feel myself getting weaker and less flexible too so I want to be exercising. I would love to swim again but the closest pool takes an hour to drive to. Nothing beats a brisk walk or a jog for a couple miles, but I can't do that anymore. I have full range of motion everywhere except my hips, and my spine (doesn't bend backward well.

Exercise,Exhaustion day after swimming - cause/how to combat?,"Hi all, I've been incorporating swimming in to my exercise routine for about 6 weeks. I swim at a lake (always with a buddy) once a week and typically cover about 1.5 - 2 km per swim. I swim at a reasonable clip but if doing 2 km it usually takes me about 45 - 50 minutes. I usually tack on about 15 extra minutes of treading water in the middle of the lake. This summer's the first time I would say I swim regularly since at least 14 years ago.

In addition to swimming, I do some combination of a 5 - 10k run, HIIT and resistance training 4 days a week. I would say my fitness level is good. I'm 32F, 5'7 and 140 lbs.

Here's my question: how do I combat the INSANE exhaustion I get after swimming? I was tired to the point of nausea last night after my swim, and all day today I've been groggy and a little cranky. I have felt this way the last couple of times I've gone for a swim so I planned in advance to drink lots of (non lake) water during the day, I always coat myself in sunscreen... but today I am so tired today that walking the dog was a challenge let alone another full workout. Can anyone recommend something I can do (or not do) to combat this fatigue? Or is it simply a question of my body needing to toughen up after not swimming for so long?",nindiesel,self.Exercise,1595713110

Thank you for taking time to read this quick post. So i've recently started exercising from nothing to 30 minutes a day cardio workouts. I'm 23, 6ft 3"", 228lbs (last time I checked), and I've been experiencing some weird stomach/bowel ache (or what feels around that area. I eat my 1600 calories a day which is what was recommended for me to loose weight. It's healthy calories too. Granola, Nuts, Turkey, salad, low fat pasta and veggies. Could this stomach ache be linked to me literally burning off the fat? I've never really experienced what loosing weight feels like at all, so now because of my anxiety, i'm worried that i've developed cancer or something dumb. Can someone shed me some light saying that it's normal and it's just me actually burning off fat?

Exercise,Treadmill magnet above tablet stand -- dangerous for tablet?,"I recently got a treadmill for personal home use. It has a tablet stand that hangs a little below the main screen system, and a Bluetooth connection to sync with an app on the device. It also has one of those magnet clips that shuts off the treadmill if the magnet is disconnected to clip to your clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

The stand isn't very low though, or maybe my tablet is just tall, but if I were to use it, the top of the tablet would be resting directly on the magnet. I was trying to find out how risky that is for the tablet -- I see some sources saying stuff like weak magnets like the ones on your refrigerator aren't a risk to electronic devices, but the treadmill magnet seems stronger than that. How could I tell if the magnet poses a risk to my tablet? 

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm planning on putting an end table next to the treadmill to hold a pitcher of water, so I could put the tablet on that table instead of on the stand provided by the treadmill, but it's more convenient for the app to be right in front of me if I can put it there.)",Davymuncher,self.Exercise,1595456391

Exercise,First exercise in 10 years!!,"Please be kind because I’m really proud of myself☺️

I’m on the really heavy side of life-a combination of 44G (UK) boobs that I struggle to find a decent sports bra for, a knee injury from playing football at 15, and a pretty bad smoking habit.... Pre-knee-injury I’d walk to and from school 1.5 miles each way, do a 12 mile run every other day, weight train on alternate days to running, as well as football training 4-6pm Wednesday and Thursday, with matches on Tuesdays and Sundays. 

When I damaged my knee, my doctor refused to refer me for tests, saying it was just a sprain (18 years later I still have a heavy limp, can’t do stairs without pulling myself up, or go down stairs without my knee giving way- now written off by doctors as due to my size) meaning I had to pretty much give up all my training overnight... I did not, however, stop any of the rather large calorie intake until about 4/5 years later. Aside from a halfhearted attempt at going to the gym once a week a few years ago, not much has been going exercise wise for me lately... As a result I am huge. 5’8 and 25stone. I don’t have a problem being huge, but I also wouldn’t have a problem being smaller or at least a little bit fitter. 

So... My friend lost her mum last year, and decided during lockdown to start running a couch to 5k in the hopes of doing a charity ‘marathon in a month’ kind of thing in her memory. I’ve been watching her progress over the past few weeks and she’s done great, and raised double what she wanted to raise. She told me she didn’t think she could do it, as she has worse fitness levels than me (I walk 2 miles to work everyday whereas she drives everywhere) so I’ve been telling her how proud of her I am every opportunity I get. 

What she doesn’t realise is that she’s been inspiring me to do something a bit more exercise wise. I’ve been walking to a shop further away than my local, getting off my bus home a stop early, walking round the local streets listening to ZombiesRun! on my lunch break, little things like that.... 

But TONIGHT!!! I got home from work after a crappy 13hour shift, and saw her latest update. 24.5 miles. She’s now aiming for 40 miles by the end of the month!! I am so fantastically proud of her I’m beaming at my phone. I realise that if she can do something as amazing as that, I can push myself a little bit harder too! 

I pull out my trainers, dust off my not-very-used gym knee brace, pull on my chest binder (literally the only thing that stops me getting black eyes when doing anything more than a slow walk) and drag out my brothers ex’s copy of the Insanity workout from behind all my other DVDs. 

Instant regret! I’m sweating from pulling on my binder for goodness sake, what am I doing attempting the fit test of the Insanity workout?!? Then I realise that actually, I’m doing ok. I haven’t missed any of the exercises, and ok they aren’t perfect due to my size (seriously, they need to do a fat person version because those skinny gits obviously don’t need to be doing this!! I don’t see them trying to do Spider-Man’s or jumping jacks with a massive belly in the way!!) but I’m managing to do at least one or two of each one, with the exception of the burpees-I don’t think my knee would like me tomorrow if I attempted them, and I have a 10 hour shift lol. Every time I start slowing down, I think of my friend and how she’s doing.... Couch. 5K. 5miles. 10miles. How proud of her I am at every milestone. How proud of me she would be knowing I’m at least trying. It spurs me on to try and finish the fit test. 

I managed to do over half an hour of intense exercise. I’m sweating, wheezing, red in the face, I’m aching from muscles I’d forgotten I had, and coughing up half a lung from the 15 a day habit. I did every single exercise to the best of my ability. I had to stop a few times because I pushed myself too hard, but I got through it. 

There’s not going to be a happy ever after with this story. It’s not that kind of story. But I’ve spent at least 10 years thinking I can’t push myself to lose a bit of weight, or get a bit fitter; restricting myself because I don’t have a gym buddy, can’t afford the gym, too far from the outdoor gym, my knee won’t hold up, and all the other rubbish excuses I’ve made over the years. 

I’m not promising anyone, especially myself, that I’ll do the whole Insanity programme; but maybe I’ll do the fit test every couple of days. Maybe I’ll end up doing it every night. All I know is, despite currently wheezing from smoking too much, and the random muscle spasms from under-used muscles, I feel great. I feel like for the first time in a long time I feel like I can take control of my own fitness. And I owe it all to my friend who wanted to raise a little money for charity. ☺️",LesbianZombieCuddler,self.Exercise,1595373611

I’m looking for inspiration! 27F and I’ve lost 70 lbs over a 3 year period. Weight training for a year and a half. Luckily I don’t have loose belly skin but I have some loose skin (not extreme but noticeable) in my upper inner thighs, breasts, and maybe butt/hips. I mean maybe for butt/hips because there’s still a decent amount of fat there and it hasn’t gone crepey, but kinda feels like it’s verging on it. I’ve read that the best thing to do is fill in the space with muscle, but no actual success stories, just people suggesting it. I’m working on it, but I’m still losing fat which isn’t helping with the skin situation. Has anyone here successfully been able to tighten up loose skin by filling in the voids with muscle?

I’m 7 feet tall but I move very well for my height, I’m not an immobile/uncoordinated stick as one would picture at first thought. I can manage to do foot fires extremely slowly (nowhere close to the speed it should be) but once I try to speed up it’s almost like my legs just stop working and get stuck to the ground where I’m then just shaking my legs and starting to move backwards. I have poor hip and ankle mobility which I think may be a possible reason but even as I’ve been improving my mobility the past few months I have felt no improvement in my foot fires. The only other thing I can think of is that it could be a slight neurological problem which would explain my legs almost shutting down when I try to change the movement from almost jogging on the spot to fast pulses the balls of my foot. I only say this because I’ve had a case of drop foot in the past but at this point I would love to hear any suggestions/tips that would help me out.

Never felt full after usual meal. Within 2 years, I gained 20+ lbs. I was an athletic body type. Now, I have extra fat. I feel self-conscious. My panic attacks and anxiety have gone down for months now. I am completely off the medicine as of Tuesday. Since March, I have started eating a plant-based diet and exercising 7 times a week because I weighed 124 lbs. before lexapro, I ate a plant-based diet and worked out 5 times a week doing the same cardio (HIIT and run). I easily shed 5 lbs of being 110 lbs in 1 month. 124 is the ever highest weight in my life. Before lexapro = 110 lbs at max. Exercise regimen since March: 3 days = run for 30 min with max heart rate at 180 BPM. 2 days = HIIT workout for 40 min with max heart rate at 140-180 BPM. 1 day of 1.5 hour walk or long hike. 1 day of 15 mil bike ride avg heart rate is 130-140; highest is 185 BPM going uphill. All I have done is gain weight. Body fat % stayed the same. Pants fit the same. In fact, I have to throw out a lot of my pants because they don’t fit anymore since March. So, 2 months ago I have been slowly tapering off lexapro. In the last week at 0.50 mg, I noticed after eating 1/2 cup oatmeal, I feel very satisfied.

Exercise,I got cocky,"I've been working on my health for a couple of months now. I quit smoking, quit drinking, started counting calories, focusing on what's going into my body. Every afternoon I go for a bike ride where 80% my heart rate is in the cardio zone. Every morning I get up at 5am and take the dogs for a brisk walk, and intermittently during that walk I'll break into a jog. All my numbers are going in the right direction, I found calf muscles and biceps, I'm feeling so much better in myself.

But I got cocky.

Yesterday I took one dog for a walk and broke into a jog. I was surprised by how easy it was, and the dog slowed down before I did. So when I got home, I was bragging to my husband about how much I'd improved and that the dogs were holding me back, perhaps I should try going for an actual run without the dog, I reckon I'd be able to handle it, no worries!

Spoiler alert: I could not handle it.

I set off today, started at a brisk walk to warm up, then when I crossed the highway I started jogging. I was determined to jog for a solid 10 minutes, how hard could it be? 

60 seconds in and I'm gasping like an asthmatic giraffe that needs to sneeze. 3 minutes in and I have to pause to vomit. The next 3 minutes I have so much saliva flooding my mouth and due to the aforementioned gasping, every time I try and breathe in, I'm choking on my own spit. I interchange 30 seconds of jogging with 30 seconds of brisk walking.

There's sweat pouring off me and I can feel my face is redder than it has any right to be.

At the 10 minute mark I turn and powerwalk home. My husband starts laughing as soon as I make it inside. I collapse face first on the floor rug and decide, nope, definitely not there yet!

Exercise,How do I get rid of my ass,"I’m a 5’8 18 year old dude. I’m about 180 with a 20% body fat percentage. I’m pretty muscular and have farm boy strength so I’m a lot stronger than I seem and I have SUPER naturally muscular legs. I did seasonal swimming for 4 years and power lifted before rona and just started again going 4 times a week, 2 of those days being legs and cardio.

Now that I’m done with my sports CV, I have a huge ass. Like uncomfortably huge. It’s mostly natural muscle and it’s the kind of ass that girls will be like “you’re so lucky I wish I had your ass” and I want to get rid of it because it makes me super uncomfortable and, to me, makes me look weird/disproportionate in my clothes.

Is there a better/faster/more efficient way to get rid of it outside of regular exercise/cardio?",Tenkomanker,self.Exercise,1595018428

Exercise,Effective steps to loose belly fat!,"I’m 28F and relatively slim. 5ft and 120ibs. I’m don’t really have any fat on my body just loose muscle that needs toning. (Except for my belly) 

I had a baby about 4 years ago to be honest afterwards my due to breastfeeding and hardly eating at all (new mum life mixed with ppd) my tummy was actually the flattest it’s ever been. 

Since then my diet has been awful. Lots of wine, cookies and coffee for breakfast kind of thing.

Iv now noticed that my belly is quite chunky, chunkier then Iv ever seen before, a lot on my love handles which Iv never had before. Any fat that Iv gained is solely conterntrated there! Iv also noticed Iv completely lost the shape of me waist. 

The past month Iv drastically changed.
Reduced my sugar down to practically little to no added sugar. No alcahol. Iv been working out a few times a week, 30 mins of low impact high intense cardio and then toning exercises as well as some stomach vacuums. 
Iv noticed a slight definition happening in my stomach ... mainly my upper abdomen where there is little fat. 

Before I go on trying to lose this weight and further to tone the rest of my body i would love some tips.

I am pretty straight all the way down and when I do gain weight it is almost strictly in my stomach.  For starters, I have always been very athletic. In high school I ran a lot and was very lean (but still gained weight in the stomach area). A few years later When I was playing a different sport and squatting around 180lbs, I was very strong looking and my legs, butt, and arms got quite a bit bigger (I also gained about 15lbs of muscle), in a good way.  Still didn’t have six pack abs at my most fit. Then after I quit that sport I lost all the weight and muscle and became very very lean with some abs showing. I stopped working out all together due to an injury and now I feel like my arms and legs are very skinny but my stomach holds some extra chub. What the heck is my body type???? I want to do effective workouts to lose stomach fat but I don’t want my legs to keep getting skinnier. I can’t ever lift as heavy as I was before due to my injury, and I also don’t want to.

Exercise,Advice on current workout routine?,"21M
Hi all. I’ve been working out for the past few weeks to try to lose some weight as I’ve been pretty overweight and worried about my health so I wanted some recommendations or advice to change my current workouts to help me out more as I don’t know much about how to work out or how much to work out. My plan for a while has been as follows:

Running 1-3 miles daily, I want to get up to 3 miles daily without being too tired. I’m doing okay with this, albeit slightly below average. I ran 3 miles today at a 12:25 pace. I got more tired as it went on as I started at around a 10 minute pace and I find it very hard to get any better than a 9:30 pace

Lifting every 2 days. I found a graphic on Pinterest and have followed it for the most part every 2 days. I do 3 sets of 12 reps each with 2 15 pound dumbbells.  Goblet squats, deadlifts, floor presses, rows, dumbbell press, front raises, overhead extensions, curls. I’m terrible at knowing how much lifting to do to gain any muscle so any help would be greatly appreciated. 

I would like to try to do push ups and sit ups daily but I don’t know how many I should do to see any results. 

After running I like to drink a smoothie with a cup of fruit, a handful of spinach, ice, a cup of almond milk, and sometimes a scoop of OWYN chocolate protein powder. I also take a cold bath followed by a hot shower and try to stretch some to help with any soreness that might follow.

As for the running, I enjoy it quite a bit and want to do it everyday but my stamina doesn’t feel that high. I have mild asthma but I never feel out of breath when I’m running. It’s mainly pain in my feet from running on rocks that stops me from running a lot without stopping. I have a path that I’ve measured to be .13 miles each lap and I run around 8 laps to get to a mile and I use a Fitbit versa 2 to track it. I can run around 1 lap at a time and not much more. Any tips on fixing this and being able to run longer without stopping?

Exercise,Alcohol and exercise,"Hello dear redditors of r/exercise.

I have a question about exercise that I have been pondering for quite a while.

I come from Croatia, and I am currently vacationing in Dalmatia. Here exists a drink called ""gemišt"", which is basically 100ml of white wine and a 100ml of sparkling water. I drink approx 5 of these a day (not an alcoholic , but I'm on vacation so why not).

Anyways, since I'm a long way from my gym, I decided to swim about 1.5km every day to compensate for my alcohol consumption on vacation. 600m of it is very vigorous and fast paced swimming, while the other 900m is light but constant freestyle swimming.

My question is: do you think this is a good regimen to keep my body condition until I come home, or should I add other exercise to my routine? I'm not trying to gain any muscle or anything, just keep my current shape as it is. 

And yes, I know drinking is bad. But I am in no way a regular drinker, and I don't intend to become one. I just really need to unwind from this whole year and enjoy these two weeks with my gf as much as I can. So please, don't lynch me for drinking as much as I do at the moment. I just want your opinion on my regimen and could it survive the next two weeks.

The only place i feel soreness is the area on the front of my armpit, to the side of my pecs if that makes sense. I feel sore with every other body part workout, but for chest I just don’t feel it. Any tips on where I’m supposed to be feeling sore?

Today I want to supply y'all with a great #abworkout I did this morning!

The workout:
(45:15 stands for 45 seconds working out; 15 resting)
45:15 leg flutters
45:15 leg raises
15 crunches
45:15 plank
45:15 russian twists
15 reach the ceiling crunches
45:15 bicycles

(repeat 2-3x for full ab workout!)

I do daily ab workouts. 
I've found the core adapts really well to habitual strain.
However, some days I skip abs because they feel weak some days.

That's why rest days are so important.
They help you maximize volume in your workouts!

Exercise,"Why, after years of exercising, is it still so painful?","I started walking about two years ago, I was 6'0, 180 lbs, yet 25% body fat. Even walking for 30 minutes left me sweaty and out of breath. I did the couch to 5k thing and in about 4 months I could run just shy of a 5k ~ 3 miles. But, I would be so sore that I couldn't run for a week afterwards and I would be so out of breath that I would be wheezing and coughing. 

I've increased the amount of exercise i get to around 3 hours a week, mostly cardio, some weight lifting and body exercises. Sadly I developed bad eating habits and now I'm 200 lbs, an inch taller, and 24% body fat. There were periods where I didn't run but I hit 10000 steps nearly every day, the days I run I usually hit around 15-20k. For the last 2 months I've started eating clean but I've noticed minimal results. Still, I'm going to stick with it for at least a year and see how it goes. 

My main problem is, everyday I get winded. And its painful. I end up coughing and wheezing when I run, i nearly faint when I get up after heavy lifting. I just feel generally unhealthy and I'm out of breath all of the time. My heart pounds in my chest for hours after a run, and admittedly the entire time I'm running I'm angry, bored, and not feeling well. I hate it. Every week or so I'll get a runners high if I'm lucky and that gives me like an extra mile to run, but it's foolish to count on it and idk how to achieve it consistently. 

I figured cleaning up my diet would help my cardiovascular health, but my arteries must be clogged or something because it takes no time to feel fatigued and winded and feel the chest pain that comes with any sort of physical exertion for me. I've had bloodwork done and the doctors have always said I'm fine, they listen to my lungs and say they sound perfect, my resting heartbeat is sub 60bpm, so maybe I'm just a wimp.",PhrygianNoodles,self.Exercise,1594411672

Exercise,Muscle Gain Tips,"For muscle gain, there are a couple of best practices that I’ve found while training.

1. Volume 
High correlation between volume in your workouts and muscle gain. 
For volume, reps of 10-12 of a challenging weight helped me maximize my volume in my workouts

2. Protein 
Try to eat a good source of protein at every meal. Helps a ton. 

3. Rest 
Make sure to get at least 8-10 hours of sleep for maximum muscle gain. Our muscles repair themselves in our sleep!

4. Water 
If you’re eating a lot of protein you need to drink a lot of water because protein as a macronutrient requires more water to be broken down than carbs and fats.

5. Consistency 
The more consistent you are with your diet and workout refining the easier it’ll be to gain muscle.

And that’s about it. Hope y’all have a great Friday!",Sam_Wick,self.Exercise,1594406934

Exercise,Question.,"So I'm a fairly heavy guy, started running around 9- 10 weeks ago along along with some weight lifting. I run for around 10- 15 mins. I was doing 100M relay style jogging but recently I have been trying to improve distance by (obviously) increasing the  distance i run without stopping or walking. I had pain resembling shin splints around 4 weeks in to my running journey and eventually they just went away. I've started getting them again and this time I feel like they are drastically reducing the distance I can run because they are making running a bit painful and just generally more laborious. I just wanted to ask people who are more experienced whether this is a recurring thing that happens every now and then and if there is anything I can do to stop or reduce the shin splints? Is this a result of over exercising and should I just run through them or take a break?

Last therapy session my therapist told me she doesn't care how much I'm moving at work (you can easily get 10000 steps in in 5 hours) and I need to start doing more outside of work.

Exercise,I’ve been working out for 3 months and I have some questions,"Male, 1.82m.

I’ve been working out 3 months now, 1 month was home workouts during corona and 2 months were normal workouts.

I changed my diet completely, eating egg salad and cottage every morning, chicken breast couscous and kebab every lunch and full wheat bread yellow cheese and tuna every dinner, I also drink only water.

At the moment I workout every other day (3 workouts a week).

My questions:

1. I currently can do about 15 (in my max) bench pushups (push ups from a bench) for about 2-3 sets, is that good? How many do you guys do (those who have been working out for a long time)?

2. I started at 89.4kg and I’m now 85.6kg, is that good for 3 months (considering 1 month was during corona)?

3. In some exercises I can feel my muscles afterward but in most I USUALLY don’t, does that mean I might be doing something wrong? Does feeling your muscles is an indication that you are doing the exercises right or is it irrelevant?

4. is it possible to achieve results without going to the gym? I don’t go to a gym, I meet with a personal trainer an he brings his equipment and sometimes we meet in his apartment studio where he has more devices (couldn’t think of the right word for that) I can use.

Exercise,"1,000 pushups &amp; 1,000 sit ups.","Since the start of Lockdown I've been focusing on working out a lot and had set a goal of doing 1,000 pushups and 1,000 sit ups in a day. The sit ups were slightly modified to make them more interesting. Every time I came up I lifted a 25lb sand bag above my head.

I have myself all day to get this done and would take breaks and just do a few sets at a time. I definitely underestimated how hard this would be. The first time I tried this in March I got to 750 a piece by 11 at night and I was totally wiped out. The raising of the sandbag above my head had absolutely crushed my shoulders and I knew I couldn't make my goal of a thousand.

I tried it again about a month ago and was making good progress, but then life got in the way and something came up that took off a few hours of my day and I knew I wouldn't be able to finish.

Yesterday I decided to try again. I started at about 8 in the morning. I made sure to eat lots of carbs and protein throughout the day. By the time I got to 500 a piece my left elbow was starting to hurt. I really wanted to hit this goal and just kept going. The last 200 apiece were so hard yeah, but it felt so good to hit the 1000 mark around 10:45pm

I had ran a half marathon in October, and I was surprised at just how much harder this was.

I know this was a very random goal, and honestly I think it tested more of my mental fortitude than anything else, but I am so glad I did it.",colocop,self.Exercise,1594315654

Exercise,Light or moderately active?,"Hello everyone!!!

I’m F, 23, 62kg, 164cm. 

I am not a pro athlete but I used to compete in social events (pre quarantine) and I take CF open quite seriously so I’m just an crazy wannabe CrossFitter athlete I guess lol. However, I’m finding a hard time setting good macros/calories for me that I can stick to without changing and adjusting because of the knowledge and things I read, but I realized that I may be underestimating the amount of physical activity I do, so if I set that.. I may figure out the rest! 

So here it’s (this is my routine in quarantine, of course it was not like that before, probably MORE intensity) 

1- I do strength training 5 times a week (an hour = one compound heavy lift + 5 to 6 bodybuilding accessories with moderate weight and mostly superset)

2- I do CrossFit WODs “high intensity” 3 times a week (12-15 minutes after my strength training)

3- I do 10-12k steps everyday. I finish 2000 steps during my workout, and go for a 40-50 minutes walk at night to finish my stay active and hit my steps. I’m also active throughout the day as my fitbit tracks every movement so the 10-12k isn’t by FORCE, I’m hyper! (I do steps even on my rest day)

Am I considered light or moderately active? 

My goal is mostly performance and stay fit! Not trying to cut or bulk, maintain and stay consistent.",666rabbithole,self.Exercise,1594270662

Exercise,A note about exercise programs," 

I've used a ton a training programs from Jeff Nippard, Athlean X and Greg Doucette as well as kinobody and BBM. I may have a couple of others as well. 

From my experience, I've tried a whole lot of them and I've found varying levels of success. In addition, there was a custom training program from an online coach.

My findings were quite interesting. Athlean X was quite underwhelming for me and I got the worst results form that. Kinobody was at roughly the same boat. The BBM templates worked quite well and the customizability made it a little better. 

I tried the Jeff Nippard Ppl and I got significantly better results than both the BBM and Upper Lower program of Jeff Nippard.

However, this is one thing that may shock many of you. I got by far the best strength and size gains while using the custom program. Of course not all coaches are equal but what I've noted is that cookie cutter programs, despite the cost, isn't worth it. The custom training plan that I bought was cheaper than most of the programs and better at the same time.

I learned a valuable lesson against cookie cutter programs.

Thanks for reading.

I'd like to know about your opinion on cookie cutter plans.

Exercise,"HELP! 15 years old male, no gains, need your advices, opinions and personal experiences (sorry if my english is not very good)"," Hi everyone, here is my problem:

It all started in august last year, when i was still 14. For 2 months I exercised daily, but I didn't see any gain, so I decided to stop.

With all this stuff of the quarantine, I realized that I had a lot of free time and decided to return into my project, since then I haven't stopped (almost 4 months). Unfortunately i got very unmotivated, because although I know the changes are not overnight, it seems that i just do not advance ( I still look like a noodle), but I have faith that with your help I could improve my body.

I´m 15 years old, I´m 1.70 m ( 5.57 ft) tall and my weight is 50 kg . due to genetics I am quite skinny and even though I eat a lot I do not gain weight. I understand that genetics greatly influences the shape of my body and genetics cannot be changed, so probably i won't stop from being thin but i know i can get a bigger body, so having said that, my goal is not to define my muscles but to make them bigger. My family unmotivates me by saying that I'm not going to change because my dad and grandfather were the same at my age, I understand that they don't say it to make me feel bad, but even so it hurts.

Also, my goal is to exercise my full body: shoulders, arms, legs, back, buttocks, chest, etc.

I train at home with an app that tells me the routine I have to do without any equipment, just my body, but I'm not very happy with this routines. Unfortunately I will not be able to go to a gym now or in the near future, but I have one 6 kg dumbell and a bar to do pull- ups in my house. I have never used these equipment anyway because i have searched a lot of routines in YouTube and none of them says how to start with them, they are all about heavy routines for advanced people or they need two dumbbells.

Well, the purpose of this post is to get help from people who can identify with my case, to know the routine you use in this cases and how to start with it and go improving it, from what area of the body I have to work out depending on the day, as well as your general daily routines ( sleeptime, feed routines or any other activities you did to improve your body)

I appreciate if you took the time to read my problem and helped me by commenting. And I repeat, I am 15 years old, so even if i didn't do any physical activity I am still growing. My goal is to get bigger, either by muscle or fat (if it is by both ways, then it would be great).

Thank you all, see you!",D0nAndy,self.Exercise,1594175685

Exercise,Anulom Vilom Pranayama - An exercise to stay healthy,"It's important to focus on our health (internally) as much as we focus on our fitness (externally)

Anulom Vilom Pranayama balances the physical and mental energy of our body.


.


.


**Benefits :**


•Increase in oxygen and effective decrease in carbon-dioxide.


•Improves blood circulation and purifies blood to toxins.


•Keep mind free from Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Mental illness, Hypertension and mind related problems.


•Keep away the heart-related problems.


•Improves concentration and mind in positive thinking.


•Give a great glowing skin with no Pimples and no skin problems.


•Keeps the body clean and strong.


•Helps to improve the functioning of lungs.


.


.


**Instructions :**


•It is suggested to be seated in a quiet, calm and comfortable position preferably in a cross-legged or meditating position on the ground. Make sure that your spine and head are straight.


•Shut your eyes and relax for a few minutes. This will help in unwinding from the surroundings and relieving stress.


•Sit in this position for a few minutes with your eyes closed until you are relaxed and ready for the pranayama.


•Now, take your right hand and slowly place it on the right nostril, while resting your left hand on the left knee.


•Press hard so that airflow through this nostril is temporarily obstructed.


•Now, slowly take a deep breath from your left nostril.


•Shut both the nostrils and hold the inhaled breath for a few seconds.


•Now, release your finger from the right nostril, which will allow you to exhale the air from it.


•While doing so, make sure that your left nostril is safely shut with the help of your ring and little finger.


•Be slow in the process of exhaling air from your right nostril, attempting to take a longer time than inhalation.


•Next, deeply inhale from your right nostril, while shutting the other one with the ring and little finger.


•Similarly, hold your breath for a few seconds by keeping both the nostrils shut.


•Lastly, exhale from the left nostril, while shutting the right one with the thumb.


•This will complete one full cycle of anulom vilom. The next cycle is begun by following the above steps and alternating between the two nostrils. 


Please [check here](https://youtu.be/2MH1xZkJ7uc) for visual reference


.


.


**Duration :**


•Perform this exercise 10 minutes everyday


•The favorable ratio for Anuloma Viloma is 1:3:1. That means if you take 4 second time in inhalation, then take 4 sec time for exhalation and hold the breath in for 12 sec.


•But if you are a beginner then start with 4:4:4 ratio.",Realgainsforreal,self.Exercise,1594171783

Exercise,Good resting heart rate to strive for?,"21M
Hi all. I’ve been attempting to run more and then eat better lately to lose some weight that I gained towards the end of high school. I’m currently 199 points at around. 5’9 and want to get to a healthy weight and am striving for around 190 by the time I go back to school in August and around 165 at some point to maintain that weight. I was around 240 at my worst last February as I’ve struggled with overeating and generally didn’t take care of myself. I’ve been running 2-3 miles daily to try to get my stamina up and burn some extra calories and strengthen my lungs since I was recently diagnosed with asthma. I was wondering what a healthy resting heart rate would be to strive for and can it be too low for someone at my fitness level? I use a Fitbit versa 2 and my resting heart rate according to it has gone down from around 69 at the beginning of June to 60-62 now. And it goes lower when I sleep, going to around 48 sometimes. I’m a very anxious person with hypochondria and worry myself a lot and worry about bradycardia. I know many people have low resting heart rates but it just kinda freaks me out with it going down so much in a short period of time. Does this indicate a healthy heart? At what point should I think of myself as being at a good resting heart rate and when should I worry? Thanks for any help :)",jdriver1212,self.Exercise,1594059432

Exercise,...so I broke my foot recently,"It wasn't a *huge* injury, it happened two weeks ago and I'm getting the cast off tomorrow to switch to a walking boot. The doctor said it was a tiny hairline fracture.

Exercise,"Hypermobile joints + obesity - looking for a bodyweight/resistanceband/dumbbell program (M, 32)"," Hi Experts

**I desperately need your help!** I'm 32, male, and I am obese. Technically, fat in a muscular body; in High school I was into bodybuilding, but having gained 40 kilos (88 pounds) since then, you can still see the muscles and the large chest, with a gigantic belly on top. I'm 184 cm high (Google says that's 6ft 7inch)

**Specifics**: I have hypermobile joints. Too much stress on them is not a good thing, as they can wear out and might be very risky in the long run. I can do pushups, situps, etc, but not overly aggressive - might be a major risk of injury.

As I mentioned above, i have some experience training, but that was a long time ago. At least I still have muscle memory and remember the techniques

**Goals**: I don't want to be bulky. I am, today as well. I have a huge chest and my upper body is quite large. I don't aim for growth at all; instead, condition, slimming down; endurance. I cannot care less for ""pushing up 10 kilos more""; Instead, I am aiming towards the guys who can just monkey around with 0 effort and just feel flexible and light.

I am fully aware no exercise will make my muscular body type into a slim, elegant one; but at least as much as possible.

Preferably, I would ask for a program that you train every day (if it's a good idea, you tell me) - it's far easier for me to build a habbit that is every day than one that is 2-3-4 times per week.

**Gear** \- resistance bands, dumbbells, I have a chin-up bar, and a stationary bike...

**Current stats:** Can do 10 classic pushups in a set, 12 crouches, no chin/pushups, 15-20 situps. I can do jumping jacks for up to 10 mins, I avoid running due to the joint issue.

**Other notes:** I was considering swimming, but that is a no-go at the moment. For diet, I'm doing lazy keto for a month now, lost 5 kilos already (\~11 pounds)",crypthon,self.Exercise,1593854090
Exercise,"Glute activation not there, feel it on my right calf instead","When I do one legged exercises such as lateral leg extensions, donkey kicks, hip thrusts, standing leg abduction, even leg raises, sometimes with squats, seated hip abductions, I can feel it a lot of it on the lateral side of my right calf (a little bit on my glute too), but I don't feel it much on my left.

Exercise,"build your press up, the press up will build you","Build and iron chest and horseshoe triceps with the simple press up, 

What's the difference between the press up and push up? Hands are inline with your torso and the elbows are close into the body as possible, 

Building them takes a lot of work, I've probably done over 10million press ups  in my lifetime, why choose it over the bench press? Well people who a great at press ups have a stronger heart if you can press up 25 your in the heart building zone. 


Before I do my press up routine I follow a strict stretching regime by doing these I've increased my press ups more and more 


Grab a towel hold it in front of you try ripping it into two I do these for 10 secs for 5 sets 

Above your head 10 secs for 5 sets 

Shoulder rotations grip a sock in each hand as tight as possible and in small circles rotate for 1 minute one way then 1 minute the other way do this for 5 sets 

Get into the press up position go down hold for 5 secs then up do as many reps as possible 


Now your ready for your press ups achieve 2 sets as many reps as you can,

Have fun

Exercise,Building an Exercise Routine and Burning off Belly Fat [18M],"I know that almost half the battle of losing the fat in your belly is your own diet, but right now I would like to focus on exercising, since frankly it's about time I took this seriously. I appreciate the help and I'd like to ask a few things as well!

For starters, my main goal is to exercise (a lot) so I can be active, fit and toned after the whole quarantine mess, burn off some of my belly fat and and maybe gain some muscle along the way. No access to a gym for me. 

Can you make the distinction between training in the gym and exercising in the house? (In my case, no equipment except dumbells) What are the separate benefits of these two? 

What kind of routine should I use in exercising at my house? What are the different types of exercises that I should do? Can I possibly gain some muscle?

In home, should I exercise with specific parts of my body in mind every day? Or should I just do a full body workout and rest the day after? 

I'm just completely puzzled on what kind of plan I should stick with, and it's hard to form one when I don't have any sort of idea or knowledge about different exercises and routines, what's good for me or not.

One more thing: Yoga. I know that there are many different approaches to Yoga, and I'm not planning on doing it on my own, as I'd have no idea whether I'm doing it right or not. But, is there a way to incorporate it into an exercising routine?",Jaguar_St,self.Exercise,1593791544

Exercise,Thinking about finding a gym with a pool.,"I find excersise boring. I would want a gym that has rock wall climbing, swimming, obstacle courses, and all that good stuff. Instead they have treadmills and dumbbells. I can't really complain about all that stuff since I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority when it comes to my interest. Not to mention all the people who are older and a typical gym would benefit them more so. However a typical gym is boring to me and thus I quit exercising. Even though it has good results and technically not a waste a time, I can't help but consider it a waste of time. I could be doing so much more entertaining things. 

I know some gyms have pools. I really like swimming and can swim for hours. So I was thinking about doing just that, swimming. 

I've never been to a gym with a pool, so I have some questions. Is it an empty pool or a pool that has those things that separates each swimmer? Also, I know not to act insane and jump in, but will I be able to atleast drive under like a seal? Scrape the bottom with my stomach and emerge up? Lastly, I have an (odd?) swimming style when it comes to going fast. I swim on the my side with my head under and use one arm, both legs, and a bit of body sway to push myself forward. I win fun races by doing this but I also think my feet aggressively hitting water is causing splashes. That's probably how I win so really I'm a loser. But my question on this one is would you swimmers be angry at my swimming even if you are far away? Simply be angry at the noise?",Not_For_Anyone,self.Exercise,1593662383
Exercise,Need Advice Please!,"So I am a 19 year old male who’s goal is reduce body fat percentage down to 14-16 percent or have visible abs before I start dorming in college in 2 months time. So I’ve been trying to do a calorie deficit in addition to working out and doing cardio. I need advice because I’m not confident if this will get me to my goal in 2 months

So here’s some of my body and nutrition info
Weight = 186 lbs
Height = 6’2”
So my maintenance calories are 3160 
I’ve brought I down to 1,910 for the deficit with (145 g protein, 55 g fat, and 206 carbs)
I believe my current body fat percentage is 23%

I’ve been following that deficit for about 4 days now and I’ve been doing full body workouts Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in addition to doing 30 minute jumprope Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday...

Exercise,Are Tae bo and Zumba videos + dieting good for weight loss?,"Just a quick note, Yes, I will be incorporating a good diet with this. I would like to aim around loosing 1.5 - 2 lbs a week by cutting out a healthy amount of calories, and using taebo or zumba to burn maybe and extra 200-300 calories.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 26 year old guy, pretty much sedentary with sedentary hobbies. Many people wouldn't consider me fat, but I have a gut and don't like how I look in the mirror. I'm 5'10 and probably weigh somewhere between 210-220 last I measured I was 212 lbs. I've never weighed that much but it changed because I went from working at Target (being on my feet for 5-8 hours a day for usually 3-6 days a week, and lingered around 170-180 lbs to sitting down for 8-9 hours a day, 5 days a week, with small short moments of movement and maintaining +210 lbs.

&amp;#x200B;

I am good at dieting but I think I mess up because I focus on too many things and burn myself out,  dieting, weight loss, macros, cooking and weight lifting, I focus on macros and try to maintain muscle mass while loosing weight. whenever I try that, I give up even though I see results.  I just get tired and stressed from other factors like work and money and the stress of meal prepping, coming back from work feeling mentally tired and not feeling like I have enough time to relax when i get home and enjoy my hobbies. I revert back to my starting weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking to go a more simplistic route and just focus on dieting (watching my calorie intake, eating healthy, but not stressing over macros and eating tons of protein) and doing zumba, or taebo workout routines for 30mins - 1hr a day.  I know that some activity is better than no activity, but I want to somehow mimic the rate at which I burned calories at my old job just by walking for numerous hours by replacing it with doing full body activities for a chunk of time 4-5 times a week, (or twice daily for 3 days a week)",KeatonTS,self.Exercise,1593545604
Exercise,Sedentary teen wanting to lose weight,"Hello, I'm a sedentary teenager and I want to lose weight since I'm getting fat because of the quarantine. My daily exercise before quarantine was walking a total of at least 4-5km (~2.5-3miles). It helped me maintain my weight even though I often ate fast food for convenience. 

It has been almost 4 months since the start of quarantine in our place, and I have never went out since then because they don't allow those below 21 to go out, I cannot do my daily walking anymore. I also don't workout at home because to be honest, I am lazy. My only occasional ""exercises"" are when I feel like going to the rooftop of our apartment (3 levels) or when I just feel like working out, which is only a few squats and jumping jacks.

I tried following a 15-minute workout routine once on YouTube; I have low stamina because of my lack of exercise, I feel like I'll run out of breath and pass out just after 7 minutes, but the video says to have only 5 seconds of rest, so I quit. It was a ""for beginners"" video too, which makes me less motivated. I also got really sore the following day that it hurts to move my body and thus, can't follow up with the routine.

I want to change though, which is why I'm posting here. I want to lose weight and I would really appreciate some tips on how to stay motivated throughout the whole process. I'm open to workout routines, which are hopefully ultimate beginner friendly for a sedentary like me - I don't want to feel like passing out again.

TL;DR: I'm a sedentary teen without any proper exercise for the last 4 months, but I also want to lose weight. Need tips to stay motivated, and hopefully some workout routines without me feeling like passing out.",Wilmoomin,self.Exercise,1593545222

Exercise,Here's why most people hate working out,"I believe that the reason most people abhor working out is that humans didn't evolve to deliberately expend energy. Homo sapiens lived in food scarcity much, much longer than we (most people in the developed world, anyway) have lived in food abundance. 

Why does this matter? For one thing, life is short and our free time limited, so why spend it doing something you hate? But also, research shows that the benefits of exercise are greater if you enjoy the exercise. 

What can we do about this? We can take a tip from the Blue Zones, the regions of the world with the highest life expectancies. Blue Zones author Dan Buettner likes to shock his audiences by telling them that individuals in the Blue Zones do not exercise. What he means is that they do not *work out*. Instead, exercise is built into their day; Buettner calls it *moving naturally*. People in the Blue Zones are shepherds, farmers, and gardeners. They hike miles to visit neighbors. They cook without many kitchen appliances (kneading bread is good exercise!).

So there you have it: there is no reason to go against our evolutionary grain and deliberately expend energy. Just move naturally. When I realized how much I hate working out, I went over my daily routine to find ways that I could replace a task with a more active version. I came up with the following:

* Bike to work and errands. A bike ride to work takes me about 40 minutes each way.
* Use a treadmill desk. These are expensive, so I instead bought a $65 portable under-desk treadmill to use with a makeshift standing desk (desk with textbooks under each leg). I can't use it at work, though.

These activities provide plenty of daily exercise. I just need to find a way to integrate arm strengthening into my daily routine, lol.",EnvironmentOverWill,self.Exercise,1593388683

Exercise,list of Morning Habits That Can Affect Your Entire Day,"Your morning routine is like setting up a string of dominoes: You line up everything to succeed, but a single false move can turn everything upside down. In order to set the right tone for the rest of your day, experts say you need to adapt the following seven habits.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. HITTING THE SNOOZE BUTTON**

It's tempting to steal a few extra minutes of sleep, but napping has a negative impact on your physical and emotional well-being, says Joanna Kleinman, owner of the Center for Extraordinary Relationships. Physically, pressing the ""snooze"" button makes you groggy and less productive because you keep waking up from a deep sleep,"" explains Joanna Kleinman. ""Emotionally, you're getting ready to be late, in a hurry and stressed in the morning.""

The obvious solution, according to Kleinman, is to get out of bed immediately (even if it seems impossible). ""If we listen to our minds tell us what we want to do, we can never make the positive changes,"" Kleinman says.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. PLANNING YOUR DAY**

If you wake up without knowing what you need to do, where you need to be or what you're going to wear, your day is already starting frantically. Psychologist and certified master coach Joel Ingersoll recommends organizing your day the night before. This way you will feel invigorated and ready to go in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. CHECKING YOUR PHONE**

Doing this in the morning stimulates self-criticism and judgment in your mind, Kleinman says. ""Your emails and texts are about things to do, things to buy, things to add to your to-do list,"" she says. ""It corresponds either to the things that others want you to pay attention to, or to what your mind tells you to do.

Even if you leave your inbox alone and stick to Instagram, you can hurt your psyche because social media pushes you to compare yourself to others. Bottom line: Checking your phone in the first place can wake up your inner review. To prevent you from opening Twitter immediately after turning off your alarm, charge your phone to another room. Instead, start your day with a habit that allows you to assert yourself, such as keeping a diary or meditating.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. DRINKING WATER**

You may want a cup of coffee as soon as your feet touch the ground, but what your body really needs is a glass of water, says Ingersoll. Since you have not had fluid in your system for at least six (or hopefully eight) hours, your body is dehydrated. You can have a coffee (see below), but your body will work better - you'll have less headaches, less fatigue and smaller pockets under your eyes - if you first drink a glass of water, says Ingersoll.

**5. SKIPPING BREAKFAST**

Have you ever been told to have a good breakfast? That's because it's important, says Bruno LoGreco, life coach and author of Stop Sabotaging Your Life. ""Eating a healthy breakfast of nuts, fruit and oats will satisfy your brain so you can have a tough day at the office,"" says LoGreco. It's best to avoid doughnuts and croissants, as they will give you a sugar boost and prepare you for an accident as soon as you arrive at your office.

**6. RISING EARLY**

A study published by the American Psychological Association found that early risers are happier and more efficient than those who go to bed late. They tend to be more proactive, get better grades, better anticipate and minimize problems.

Exercise,Rib injury. Advice?,"Hi all, a week ago I took a big hit to the ribcage while boxing. Since then I'm having a lot of pain from rib 6 to rib 8, just lateral of the mid-clavicular line on the left side. Yesterday I accidentally extended my thorax too far and I heard a ripping/crackling noise from the injured area, since then the pain is much worse. Both the ribs and the intercostal areas are painful on palpation and every movement, cough or deep breath causes severe stinging pain. There aren't any external inflammation signs.

I'm a medical intern currently working in the OR and with this pain and seriously compromised movement I'm having a really hard time atm. I know there is no real treatment for these types of intercostal muscle strains or rib fractures but I'm also not looking for a diagnosis or for suggestions to get an X-ray. I'm simply wondering if any of you went through the same injury and if you have some advice for speeding up the healing process, also because I want to resume working out in general asap. Do you know any specific upper body workout exercises which from your experience cause  relatively low stress on the intercostal areas (thus without the risk of worsening the injury) and that can be done without extreme amounts of pain? Also, how much time did it take for your rib injury to heal?

I'm 24 yo, 6ft4, 170lb, 14% bf. I supplement daily with magnesium, zinc, calcium, creatine, omega-3 fish oil, vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and I eat a healthy diet high in protein.

Exercise,Pain in finger - Help!,"I have been doing pull ups on a 90 degree ledge for about a month, they have really improved my finger strength and grip strength much better than a bar, as well as keeping me able to move my body weight around when unable to climb. The exercise is amazing and I really don't want to stop, it has taken a while to find an exercise that feels so good and has so many benefits.

However I have begun feeling a pain on the underside of the joint (the one after the knuckle) on my middle finger on one hand only, I have noticed I am now unable to fully contract my middle finger without external force and this causes pain.

Is this some kind of muscle spasm thing that will pass? Is there anything I can do post training as a finger stretch to stop this from happening? It would be great if anyone who has experienced this could offer some advice.

Exercise,The beginner prison workout guide,"First time posting on this subreddit, my story starts when I was 20 the first time I entered a prison, one thing is for sure I wasn't what you where called athletic or naturally strong, I had to find a way to build some muscle on my body quick and fast, but I wasn't aiming for a mirror body i needed functional strength, I need to be explosive,strong and have endurance, when I first entered the yard i was a fish, now if your a fish there's no chance of entering the weight yard, i had to find my own way.

This workout guide will work for anyone, it will make you strong, not just mirror strong but functional strong, it doesn't matter how much you bench press, doesn't matter how much you can curl, you don't need them here.

I've set this program up for effectively for people with limited time, no use using the set and reps i used in prison when we use to do 30 work sets, but this guide 
Can easily made harder or easier depending where you are in your fitness journey. 
I've catered this for beginners hope you enjoy 

You workout 3 days of the week.
Make sure to warm up effectively for 15 minutes before each workout 

MONDAY - push ups 
There are hundreds of different push ups but where going for the standard one here, you want to go slow, full extension no half reps if you cannot do a full push ups start with the knee version.

Push ups - 2 sets perform as many reps as you can slowly keep your core engaged , feel your muscles working, engage your chest and your triceps focus using these muscles when performing the push up 

STEP UPS -  find a step,chair bed anything, perform 20 steps ups each leg, you want to aim for 5 sets, this will get your heart pumping and legs growing, great for hamstrings and calf's.

Tricep dips - use a chair or a stable surface to make the workout easier bring your legs closer to your body to make them hard extend them out 2 sets max reps 

Cool down with some stretching, hold the stretch for 5 seconds rest then repeat do this a few times make stretching a workout 


Wednesday - 

Bodyweight row - build your back with rows the easiest version is standing rows, 2 sets Max reps 

Crunches - complete 3 sets of 20 reps 

Concentration curls - grab a sock bring arm straight with shoulder while squeezing the sock flex and tension  your bicep as much as possible squeeze the day light out of the sock 3 sets 10 each arm 


Friday -

Prisoner squats - place hands behind head get close to a seat bend down till you nearly touch the seat stand back up, if your proficient in your squats you won't need the seat, bend down to your legs are bent just passed 90 degrees and stand back up again 
5 sets of 15 

Side shoulder raises - grab your working arm by the wrist your arm will be at 90 degrees and straight in line with your shoulder at the top of the movement, place some pressure on your working arm as your lifting it 
5 sets 10 each arm 

Toe touch - slightly bend your knees and try to touch your toes hold for 5 seconds and slowly back up, this will stretch the hamstring but we are using it as a strength excersise as well.",Tora586,self.Exercise,1592810107

Exercise,This vs That: Traditional Gym or Kickboxing (9Round),"Hello everyone.

I'm curious on your thoughts about ditching the gym for a 30-Minute Kickboxing Circuit. 

I'll attach a link at the end of this post to the 9Round website so everyone can get an in-depth look of what I'm looking at.

I'm thinking about ditching the regular gym as I often feel unmotivated to go, and I feel I don't see the results I'm hoping for (Yes, I know it takes time and hard work) but I took a few kickboxing classes hosted by a local Martial Arts gym in college, and enjoyed the community, the work the coaches drive into you to push your hardest and the sweat I broke there was a much more satisfying feel than I've had at the gym.

While I know I do like the fast-pace of kickboxing more, is it possible to reap the same benefits as that of a regular gym in a 30 minute circuit?

Thanks for your insight, and remove the post if it's not allowed.

Thanks!

Exercise,Advice for losing weight?,"I'm young - underage - and quite chubby. I've never really talked about it but my body is the greatest source of my insecurity. Before the start of the year, I decided I'll finally do something about it, but alot of issues really interfere with it. My parents were never really big on staying fit themselves, they're hypocritical, often jumping between ""get off your lazy bum"" and ""you're not fat, you're healthy"" when wanting to lose weight; I don't really have any sort of privacy at home, don't even have a room for myself; can't get on any diets because I'm ""too young"" according to my parents and therefore can't meal plan either; plus rice is a three-meal-a-day type of food to us.

I apologise if this isn't really appropriate to ask in this subreddit, but any advice on losing weight even with those issues? I've been on the treadmill an hour a day for the past couple months trying some HIIT workouts since I'm not really comfortable with doing any other workouts around my family, but honestly I don't know if it's working and have always been too afraid to ask.

Exercise,Why does it feel like my intestines are dropping while doing jumping jacks?,So I try to workout everyday with Wednesday’s and Saturday’s being restdays. I end every workout with 100 jumping jacks and halfway through the workout I chug a 12oz-18oz protein shake(I change the liquid amount but never change how much powder I put in). Most of the time I can do all 100 with no problem however recently I’ve been noticing pain in the area right of my belly button(but a little bit lower)  and I’m pretty sure it’s my intestines. It almost feels like they’re being knocked out of place while jumping. Normally even when I feel the pain I can still finish my set but today I had to stop after 50. I can stand on one leg and jump fine so I don’t think it’s my appendix. I should probably mention that I’m 16M and was diagnosed with gastroparesis recently.

I  need to be sure I can lift those weights effortlessly. I can now but I will admit I struggle a bit, proven by a recent UPS visit. I lifted some dumbbells yesterday but as usual I feel as if later down the rode I will be doing those exercises and gain no results because I'm doing something wrong. I look at exercise like a math equation. You mess up in the middle of it then you will not get the correct results. 

What about I do? I looked up some things and my main concern is eating more. I don't want to risk getting fat...is that part really that important? 

Also do I need to do more exercises then just lifting? I've been avoiding pushups because I feel as if I don't do them right even though I can reach 20. Furthermore I hurt my tailbone recently because I was sliding down a creek down little waterfalls and my tailbone took a direct hit. So doing that movement cause discomfort.

Exercise,Started exercising to lose belly fat!,"I got fat and bloated this quarantine lockdown. I have no exercise, and I was just eating any food I want. I also got drunk almost everyday.

[Before and Present](http://imgur.com/gallery/SsbCQ8q)

So since June 3, 2020 I decided to lose my belly fat. 
I'm 160cm, 52kg current (I didn't know my weight last June. Maybe 55kg :p)

The steps I have been doing so far is:
1. Eating high fiber cereals in the morning
2. Not eating that much at night. (Although in some social cases I ate a lot at night)
3. Following this exercise in YouTube helps: 
[15min lose fat exercise](https://youtu.be/bleOTMDa3_4)
[yoga for back](https://youtu.be/CO3racIlTcg)

I try to do this in the morning and it really invigorates me. Makes me feel good for the rest of the day.
I have lazy days ofcourse that I don't really exercise the whole day and have been going to some friends house and not be able to eat properly. However I try my best as I can to do this 3 steps in order to lose this belly bloated fats I have. XD

I am planning from now on as well to be consistent with my exercise and log my progress.

Exercise,Trying to learn to enjoy exercising,"I really need to start exercising after work. However, I struggle with exercising for lengthy periods of time— I get bored, typically. Furthermore, I can’t do intense aerobic activities like running because I lose the ability to breathe if I push too hard (vocal cord dysfunction).

I have an exercise bike, a jumping rope, and some weights. My current plan is to just spend some time with each of them until I get tired, however long that is. 

Would it be a bad idea to not time myself and just go as long as I want until I tucker out? I know I’m supposed to exercise for about an hour, but every time I try that, I end up getting frustrated and quitting. How do you get into it?

I wish I could go swimming because that’s the one sport I could do all day long, but I can’t exactly buy a YMCA membership at the moment (thanks coronavirus) and while the beaches have lifeguards at the moment, my mother has a heart attack every time I suggest swimming in the ocean in the off-season without a lifeguard present. 

When the pandemic is over, would going swimming for like an hour a day be sufficient exercise?

Exercise,Losing weight in the wrong places,"A rationalization I’ve always mustered for not being in the gym and trying to slim down is that I never wanted to lose fat/shape in the wrong places. I’m 5’11 and ~245 pounds, but because of the way my fat is distributed/my general dimensions (eg. waist:hip ratio), I’ve never looked as heavy as I am. Still always wanted to get into better shape. The last 2/3 weeks, I’ve been getting back to a routine of intentional eating and working out like every other day. I try not to go by numbers at all (it gets me unhealthy mentally), but i look like even if I am getting lighter, my abdominal fat isn’t budging, causing me to actually look bigger?

Exercise,Does the temperature of the room affect the results of the exercise?,"I've been easing back into regular exercise during this summer. So far I'm doing a form of HIIT-like cardio in my bedroom, which gets quite warm in the afternoons due to the sunset blasting the side of the house where my room is located. Because it was a bit balmier today, I noticed that I was much sweatier and my breathing was slightly heavier, even with all my windows/door open and blinds closed. (I know it would be a bad idea to go overboard, so I paced myself).

I'm not really upset about the heat and actually prefer exercising during this time. But I'm just wondering if this external factor upsets or improves my efforts towards aerobic fitness. Like an extra ""strain"" on the body or something that may burn more calories - if that's a scientifically correct thing to say, apologies if it's not.",xrihon,self.Exercise,1592445742

So I was feeling really good this morning and I was running faster and it felt great! But then ... my last leg of the run was uphill and I started pushing myself really hard, focusing on my form and my breathing, but then my whole body started feeling tingly. It was the weirdest thing, like all of my extremities were tingling including my head so I came to a pretty quick stop because I wasn't sure what was happening. Is that what it feels like before you faint? I've never fainted before. Should I have just kept pushing myself? Mentally I know I could have kept going but I didn't want to pass out.

Exercise,How to get into exercises?,"Hey guys, I hope it's okay to post here, it seemed to be the right place.

I (F28) have unmedicated ADHD and *really really* should work out, so it doesn't get worse. But I struggle with two things:

1. **I. Hate. Sport.** Just hate it. Always hated it. When I was young my parents forced me into gymnastics, Judo, Horse-riding, but I would always try to avoid going to lessons and quit as soon as I had the chance. I'm naturally slim and look fit, but can't even run to the bus bc I feel like almost dying after 20 steps. I tried getting into sports several times, because people kept telling me it would get easier and I would feel better... nope. I just feel horrible every time, tired and in huge pain (heart, lungs, knees, headache).
2. **I am absolutely afraid of strangers.** Unfortunately, I live in a very crowded area, so when I go out for a 20 minute walk, I meet about 50 other people. So, naturally, I almost never go out for a walk, because I'm too afraid. I tried going to the gym, but it's impossible. The trainers would never leave me alone and I can't handle strangers approaching me without warning. I ran out crying and hyperventilating more than once, before I quit.

So my question is: Is it possible to get into a proper exercise routine as a total beginner and without leaving the house? And how to I do that? Please help...",36degreecelsius,self.Exercise,1592326941

Exercise,Sick after hiit,"Today is day 8 of HIIT for me. Day 5 was a rest day. Yesterday I was so exhausted after my 45 minute HIIT (took me like 3 hours with all the breaks, I'm pretty out of shape) and today I couldn't even finish. I am seeing results in my body quickly but I feel so sick. I already don't eat a lot of carbs and my carbs have been lowered. I've been eating healthier (but still enough, I think... Sometimes I don't eat enough, but I've been eating more these past few days). 


Anyways, I feel super sick again today. I've been in bed since working out. I'm mentally tired and my body feels numb. At first I was getting anxiety relief, but now it's making me anxious. I feel like I got hit by a bus. I'm not a big work out person (haven't formally worked out every day for like 10 years) but I've been easing in to working out. Now I'm doing the HIIT. I'm sick to my stomach and feel like I have the flu. 


I usually do 15 minutes (which takes me like an hour actually because I'm out of shape) in the morning after drinking a protein shake. These past few days I've had to finish the work outs later in the day because of other responsibilities. Been eating a lot of fruits and nuts and no junk food. 


Is this normal? I'm 24f and healthy, besides being a little overweight (blood tests/checkup were normal about a month ago). Is it normal to feel so fatigued? My friend recommendes electrolytes and I drank some powerade, but it only helped a little bit. Should I be drinking Pedialyte or Powerade? I have always drank a lot of water. Tomorrow if a rest day thank God, but I'm not going to keep going if this is abnormal",infinitestrength,self.Exercise,1592258837

Start with 10 reps of the pushup, then do 10 air squats, 10 situps, 10 burpees, and 10 lunges (1 on each leg counts as 1 rep). Then repeat, but do 9 reps of each movement. Continue this pattern, doing 1 less repetition each round all the way down to 1 rep.” 

Now this sounds like a pretty doable and good workout to me and it doesn’t seem to take to long, I’m just wondering if this is a workout that will actually be effective if done daily over a period of time and if anyone has any other recommendations for home workouts without equipment

Exercise,I never want to exercise alone,"I hate exercising, first of all. Despise it to be honest, it gives me horrible anxiety. That being said, I’m an adult and I understand that it’s unhealthy to not exercise and I have to do it anyway. I’ve discovered that I enjoy to dance as exercise, and even have fun with it in a way that I can’t with regular exercise. I was in dance classes as a kid so I’m guessing this is why. But even then, I won’t do it alone. I try and work up the energy or the will and it just doesn’t happen. If I have someone else to do it with, I’ll do it if I’m asked. Sometimes I’ll even ask. But then I can’t do it long because I lose all my motivation and start building anxiety to the point that I want to stop. It’s extremely frustrating and I want to find more dance exercises I like, and some way to motivate myself to keep going with a partner past my anxiety point, or in a perfect world just exercise alone I guess. Any advice will be appreciated. 

Should probably add that I have anxiety/stress induced non-epileptic seizures.",catstachi0,self.Exercise,1591892241

Hi all, I’ve got some qns on stamina for running. I’m a beginner runner, and have been training for a 2.4km run the past few months. About 2 weeks ago I was able to consistently run it under 11 minutes. But just today, I ran about 11:40 and felt like passing out. Was wondering of some potential reasons for this drastic decrease in stamina in 2 weeks? The running conditions and time of day was quite similar. I would say that in these 2 weeks, I’ve slacked abit on my diet and ate abit more unhealthy. My sleep cycle also got messed up due to some reasons, and it was quite inconsistent and I got generally lesser sleep per night. Any advice on how to mitigate this would be helpful, thanks!",birddamnbig,self.Exercise,1591884220

I’ve been trying to run a mile a day with a 10 pound weighted vest and cut my times down since I’m just now getting back into running to try to lose some weight.

Do you think a mile a day is fine to try to cut out some fat? And how often should I run? I’ve done a mile a day and haven’t felt any fatigue or soreness the day after so I didn’t know if it was recommended that I run daily or skip some days.

Exercise,[Progression] 11 -&gt; 16 (+5) pull-ups in 37days !!,"Hey guys! Increased amount of my pull ups are just a side effect **(the link to the video prove is attached below)**. Interested? So please read it.  
If you don't like to do pull-ups, but want to increase amount of them my experience can help you.


I think that you can get a better result for the same time, if you will not repeat my mistakes and will follow my right actions. I was pretty good with pull-ups, I was able to do 11 pull-ups. I really wanted to be able to do a Muscle up and I expected that I will be able to do altleast 1 muscle up after 10 days of training. Unfortunatly for a first muscle-up I needed 18 days and I needed 34 days for 2 good muscle ups in a row !

I put some pressure on my self and I stayed consistent and focused and tried to train everyday! I watched a lot videos, but every time when I was re-watching during my training days I found something new and helpful.

I tracked my progress on the video, that was a right decision and helped me to find me my mistake. I was focused on my regularity of training. Each workout I tried to do as many sets as my shoulder joints were able to do. I always allowed myself to relax a few minutes between sets, but anyway usually I was working out over pain. I tried to train every day, but I was getting  better progress when I spend 1-2 days to restore for my muscle and shoulder joints.

After 7 days of training I was able to do a chicken wing muscle-ups. It was difficult and looked bad, it was really painful for my shoulder joints, but defently it was a progress. I started to swing more, do slow negative muscle ups and try to do muscle ups with a jump. It also helped and after 10 days more of training and pain I was able to do a muscle up. Corn pain was awful!  Finger patches made it a bit easy for me! pain affects progress!  Training gloves can help you! 
Negative muscle ups help a lot to. Try to do negative transition part as slow as posssible. Swinging before a muscle up. It will help you a lot. When your muscle memory will understand what to do and body will be enought strong, you will be able to start to do muscle ups without swinging.

&amp;#x200B;

**I was working hard on it but something helped me more:** 
* - wide grip
* - slow negative muscle-ups
* - swinging
* - explosive pull ups
* - 1-2 days for rest and recover after a training day

&amp;#x200B;

I was happy. It is so good to feel a progress. Worth it! I felt that the muscle up was perfect, but I watched a video and I saw that a left (weak) hand had a slight delay. I thought that the next days will be easy and I will do a perfect muscle up in 3 days, but that was a mistake. Next days I wasn't able to repeat a muscle up. I continued to practice, I was feeling that my body was becoming stronger and I knew that the day is comming. I took few days to relax to my body and in 34 days from beggining I did two perfect muscle ups in a row. After that I was able to do a muscle up at any time. My muscle memory just has it! I was still swinging before a muscle up, but not too much already and I felt that soon I will be able to Muscle ups with out swinging.

**My history of results:** 

* \- Day 1: 11 pull-ups 
* \- Day 7: First ""chicken wing"" Muscle UP
* \- Day 18: First muscle-up with a little in 1 hand 
* \- Day 34: Two muscle UPs in a row 
* \- Day 37: 16 pull ups

&amp;#x200B;


**The main idea of this post is that you can find an interesting trick on horizontal bars, and train this trick and as side effect your amount of pull ups probably will be increased.**

I tried overdo myself, but practice showed me that it is a bad idea.  That is only way to finally do a muscle up: Practice, rest, practice, rest, and again.. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps for those that are still learning. Just keep practice and give the muscles time to recover and rest and sooner or later you will be able to muscle up.

If I.. a skinny guy did it, anyone can do it :D

I exercised today to “unfat” myself and man i’m just so disappointed in myself. My max push-up reps used to be low 70s on a good day and low 60s when sore. Now my max is 15... 15 push-ups... that is so insanely embarrassing. My running? man i used to warmup with a mile jog and today i felt like i was borderline going to faint not even half way through.

warmup has now become my goal, and man i’m just so mad at myself for letting myself slip.

Exercise,"Sore tailbone, should I rest?","I've been doing the Chloe Ting 2 week program just to get myself back into an exercise habit and to see for myself if the program works. It's HIIT workouts and there's quite a few moves where you balance on your tailbone, and when I got down to exercise today I noticed my tailbone suddenly hurt a lot when I tried those moves, and I had to just do different moves when those came up because it was too painful. It's fine now that I'm just chillin though I can still 'feel' it a little.

Should I keep supplementing those moves or just stop? Google isn't showing me much, though some results are saying to just walk and avoid high impact stuff.

Exercise,100 pushups a day for 30 days. My body result and strength result 33 -&gt; 45 (+12) push ups,"Hey guys! After working on it for 30 days, I just share my thoughts and results

My result is pretty good **(the link to the video is attached below)**, but I think that you can get a better result for the same time, if you will not repeat my mistakes and will follow my right actions. I was pretty good with push ups, I was able to do 33 push-ups, and I expected that I will be able to do altleast 50 push ups after 30 days of training. Unfortunatly I was sick at the moment of checking maximum amount of push-ups and I was able to do only 45 push-ups.

Decent result, but you can get a better result.

I did not do any physical exercises a month before the challenge.


I had a goal with a 30 days deadline in my head. I put some pressure on my self and I stayed consistent and focused! I tracked my progress on the video and notes in the phone, that was a right decision and helped me to see how my push-up results are changing and how my body is changing. I was focused on my regularity of training.  Every set I did as many push ups as I can. I always allowed myself to relax a few minutes or hours between sets, my goal was make 100 push-ups a day. Anyway first days I was working out over pain. I tried to train every day, but I was getting better progress when I spend 1-2 days to restore for my muscle.

&amp;#x200B;

**First day I checked my body-sizes and weight:**

* My weight was 55.5kg = 122.36 pounds
* Waist: 71,5 cm = 28,15 in
* Chest: 87,5 cm = 34,44 in
* Left hand: 27,0 cm = 10,63 in
* Right hand: 27,5 cm = 10,82 in

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I tried to trick my mind and I did 1 set of push ups as soon as I woke up and second set after morning bathroom time. It was begining of the day but I was half way of daily needed push-ups. After 15 days I was happy. I almost didn't feel muscle pain and felt strength of my body. It is so good to feel a progress. Worth it! I thought that the next days will be easy, but after 15 days of the training it felt laziness to do any push-ups. I did them anyway, but I hated that.

&amp;#x200B;

**My notes of the experiment:**

* Day 2: I already feel pain in the pectoral muscles, my triceps, my back
* Day 3: I skipped day number 3, because it was too much painful. I wasn't able to rise my hands, I wasn't able to do like 10 push-ups. It was really painful. I will do skipped push-ups during next days
* Day 9: I did 101 push-ups in 4 sets. This is definitly progress, because before I always needed to do 5 sets or more.
* I see already that my body became a little bit different. I started to see my abs. As I see visually my chest became a little bit bigger
* Day 15: I do 4 sets a day for more than 100 push-ups. I began to do explosive push-ups. They are more difficult, but I should get a better result. Explosive push-ups are when you push yourself up with maximum speed
* Day 20: All muscle pain has gone. I am very lazy to do push-ups, but I do them anyway. I did an experiment how quickly I can do a hundred of push-ups. I spent 19 mins. Ussually I do them without rush during the day.
* Day 21: I definitely feel more pain than in previous days, but not too much.
* Day 25: I became sick. In the last week of the 30-day challenge, I got a little sick and went to a lot of parties. That didn't help to do push-ups.


&amp;#x200B;

**Results after 3028 push ups:**

My belly area became smaller, but my chest and arms became bigger.

* Waist: -1,5 cm = -0,59 in
* Chest: +1,0 cm = +0,39 in
* L.hand: +0,4 cm = +0,16 in
* R.hand: +0,5 cm = +0,20 in
* I lost 0.6 kg = 1.32 pounds
* **Maximum amount of push-ups = 45 (+12)**

I tried overdo myself, but practice showed me that it is a bad idea. I would reccomend: exercise, rest, exercise, rest, and again..

Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps for those who wants to start to do push-ups and change your body.

Just train and give the muscles time to recover and rest, and sooner or later you will get your dream results =)

Probably I will repeat an experiment with more push-ups, with a different diet, maybe different exercises.

It was cool.

And here is my video with my way and body results: [https://youtu.be/JrT_jemyqzU](https://youtu.be/JrT_jemyqzU)

**I appreciate any likes and support.**

Thanks guys!",JohnFavro,self.Exercise,1591477984
Exercise,Is it realistically possible to get the “gym bod” if I haven’t exercised my whole life already?,"I’ve been extremely lazy up until this quarantine happened. I’ve been extremely unhappy with how I look and I’m jealous of people who look fit and thin.

I’m 18, and I haven’t done any exercise at all up until a month ago. All I can do right now is cardio because I hurt my wrists and they’re taking so darn long to recover. It hurts to do anything with them, so weights and other body building that use them worry me right now.

I don’t want to go to a gym right now until I know it’s safe. Gyms that are full of sweaty, heavy breathing people just doesn’t seem safe right now and I don’t want to bring home a virus to my dad. Until it’s safe, (which could be a long time ) I can’t go to a gym.

It’s worrying me that I won’t be able to look good. I’m overweight and have no equipment to shape myself, I just look like a person who sits and eats. plus I’m struggling enough as it is to diet and lose weight. When I see people who look good, they have been doing it for a long time, I’ve kind of just wasted my time and now I’m regretting it.

I want to look better, feel better. It will probably raise my self esteem a lot if I can, but I’m worried.",The_Zoinkster,self.Exercise,1591474277

Exercise,Question about weight loss and muscle gain,"Hey everyone.

So after being overweight (5'10 M late 30's) for the past 10 years or so I am in the right place and doing all the right things.  I have been in the 280's for the past 10 years and late in 2019 I quit drinking and stated exercising.  On March 31st I had a insurance physical and I was 210 pounds!.   I don't check the scale often cuz it seems to be more of a demotivaor for me so I just prefer to track calories, exercise, etc and trust that will work. 

So from March 31st I was super motivated, and set out to get to my goal of under 200 pounds.   With the Covid stuff my gym was closed so I took up jogging.   In the months of April and May I jogged 4 miles per day with the exception of maybe 4-5 days where weather wouldn't cooperate.  I also have a Peloton bike and am on a 70+ day streak of doing 30+ minute rides per day.   I should add, I am enjoying this, and its not something I am doing just because.  I also ate right 95% of the days with a cheat day less than once a week that considered of chicken fingers or something like that and 1 serving size - not going crazy.   I do drink a ton of Coke so that it my one downfall.  

I did not get on the scale during those two months but feel great, had to buy new smaller clothes and people mention to me daily I look great.  

On June 3rd i decided to check the scale just because.   I figured it was 2 months since I was 210 and have been doing everything right so I had to be under 200 easy if I was 210 on 3/31.   I get on the scale an weight exactly 210 still!.  I even got on and off a couple times to make sure lol

So that was definitely a bummer.  Had to figure out too.   I do still have some belly fat and was worried it was going to be loose skin but at least feel good that hopefully that will go away when I can lose the rest of the weight.

My question, after all that is could the muscle I gained in my legs from running and arms from doing interval and arm rides on the Peloton be that much that the weight loss in fat was factored out by muscle gain?

Do I change up my routine?  Everything you read says calorie deficits lead to the weight loss and having perfect months on my apple watch and the Peloton shows a huge deficit.   

I guess I am just trying to stay motivated.   That's why I don't check the scale.  Its just a number.  I feel great, think I look great, people notice every day my transformation so its more just confusing how the number couldn't have changed....",lsarge442,self.Exercise,1591377387

Exercise,How to... like exercising?,"You could tell I had a hard time naming this lmao. I never grew up doing exercise or sports. I take a lot after my parents, who live very sedentary lifestyles and are far more interested in the arts rather than doing any sort of physical activity. We are blessed enough to have access to healthy foods, so I'm not particularly overweight and eating healthy has never been much of an issue for me. But I can't exercise for the life of me... and I don't even hate exercise. I just... have no craving for it.  It's hard to get myself to do it, even if I do things like listen to music/follow a video. It doesn't help that I don't like the gym, for a variety of reasons. I've done at home workouts before, the longest streak being working out five days a week for a month but. It was just so boring and exercising feels so awkward. I haven't done much exercising since then and that was two years ago, yikes. I have practically zero kinesthetic ability (I avoid any function that involves dancing as I am absolutely terrible haha) and even WALKING feels weird. I want to exercise though, because I've been suffering from depression for a long time and I know how important movement is for the mind/body.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading this far if you have. Basically my question(s) is, how do I make exercising more fun? How do you guys crave it? How do I become more in-tune with my body? Should I be taking classes? Are there any fun activities that aren't necessarily labeled as exercising, but could be used to supplement it? Where do I even start?

A low impact cardio class triggered some quad tendon pain on both sides so I have to avoid triggering this for a long while, I think. Unfortunately, all the advice I receive on alternative exercises says I should do low impact classes. This makes sense for the patella tendon, but not the quad tendon as is my issue. Also, low impact CAUSED the problem!
It's been nearly 3 weeks now so I think I will probably need a good 6 week quad tendon rest. How can I keep up my leg fitness without hurting myself? I think lunges and reverse lunges are out of the question for a while.

Exercise,Not sure where to go from here,"Hello! Just a quick bit for context:

I’m a 17M and have recently become committed to exercising daily, due to all the time and energy I’ve had during the pandemic. Since mid to late March, I have been using the treadmill to exercise (increasing speed and incline as time goes on). I’ve recently measured my BMI and it resulted in ~20, which is strange to me because my stomach has lots of fat but virtually nowhere else on my body has fat (arms, legs, thighs, etc). So I essentially appear “skinnyfat” despite having a BMI of ~20 (I’m not sure if that’s normal at that measurement so please correct me if it is).

My overall goal is to have a body I can look at in the mirror and be proud of. My goal now is to tone my abdomen due to my BMI telling me I’m  average, but I’m not sure if I really should tone or dedicate more energy to the treadmill. Furthermore, I’d also like to know if anyone personally recommends any abdominal exercises meant for toning, using either the ground or an exercise ball (I could oblige to the ball, but it kind of hurts my back, not really sure if it’s a form issue or because the ball is an incorrect size).

I have muscular arms, I feel my abs are there, but they don’t fully show, I have no muscles on my upper chest and have what no man wants to admit they have. That’s my biggest issue and I think that’s the only part I really think losing weight would come into the question. As a whole, I need info on a weekly routine as I think that’s the best approach. I mainly want to target my upper body(shoulders, chest, back) and I have literally no equipment except for a mat, ladders, and a jump rope. I’m super overwhelmed with all the things online and I’m not going to buy some stupid “weight loss techniques” book because I don’t need to lose that much weight; I just want to build muscle. A normal day for me would be some basic ab exercises because I already have abs, but they don’t fully “pop”. I only do about 5 minutes of an exercises as to maintain my muscles if that’s a thing. I also do a small amount of leg excercises and might do some push-ups here and there. Not much because I don’t know what to do. It’s been tough trying to make a schedule for myself. Any help is appreciated. 

   I assume doing any exercise would help contribute to the removal of the bit of fat on my torso as my diet is pretty good, so sticking to exercises that would shape my body would be preferred.",GTrend18,self.Exercise,1590911268

The pain was mild but within a couple of days, the it got worse and movement from my thumb really started to hurt. I researched and based off a self diagnosis, I am pretty sure it’s de Quervain tenosynovitis. Now I have held off from weight lifting since in the hopes that the pain would wear off but after researching that it could take weeks if not months for my wrist to heal, I’m deciding to fight thru the workout while taking precautions. I bought wrist bands that are suppose to help with just this problem. I can’t go to the clinic since most are closed due to quarantine but I also don’t have health insurance and can’t afford it. My biggest gripe is not being able to weight lift even tho I’m unsure if the workouts were the cause of the pain or playing video games.

I'm M15: I am not overweight (137 pounds, 5""7) and have a healthy BMI, however I have a stomach and moobs showing which I'm really self conscious about as they started showing through my shirts.

I know nothing about exercise; never been to a gym or anything and have just done whatever I want; however recently my mum has gotten loads of gym equipment in my house because of lockdown and I would love it if I could look somewhat skinnier before I return to school in September. 

Currently, I have a Treadmill and a Cross Trainer; and am also getting an exercise bike soon. Also this may seem unrelated but I have a VR headset with games like beat saber, which many people recommend is good for a warm up before exercising. 

I was wondering if people could somewhat make a schedule to follow during a week. Things like how long I have to spend doing an exercise routine and what I should spend that time doing. 

Since the start of this year I've gotten into the habit of drinking nothing but water and have been trying to keep my calories lower then usual as I know a massive part of weightloss is purely calories.

Also, I'd appreciate any other tips about exercise in general.  Sorry if this question gets asked a lot here, I'm just looking for some advice

Exercise,Best piece of equipment to work your core. Unable to do floor exercises.,"I’m happy with most of my body except my stomach. I look like I’m 9 months pregnant and have hanging stomach skin. I have a severe germ phobia and won’t do a work out in the floor or on a mat. I’ve tried, but I know myself and I won’t do it. I need a piece of equipment but I wasn’t sure the best route. I like the DB squat machine that you see all over Facebook. I’ve always wanted an elliptical because that workout was always easy on my joints. My daughter wants a treadmill and I’m wanting a rower. But mainly I want the single best piece of equipment to engage my core so I can not look pregnant and have better posture. Any advice will help and be appreciated, just please don’t try and get me to do a floor exercise or the ball.

So I'm a 5'6, 42kg (about 92lbs) 17 year old. School just finished and I want to try to gain some weight. I don't have an eating disorder or anorexia or anything, I just simply don't eat enough, and I never exercise or play sports.

 By the end of summer (about 2 months from now, unless the virus delays school further) I want to weight at least 52kg. 

What should I eat, and how much calories should I aim to eat everyday? Furthermore, what calisthenic workouts should I do? I can't go to the gym because for 1; it's pretty embarrassing when you're a skinny person surrounded by big dudes, and 2 the virus has lock down many places anyway, so I really can't go to the gym period. I don't own any home weights either. Is there anything else I should know about gaining weight?

Exercise,A few questions about beginning walking workout.,"So. I've recently taken some big steps toward getting healthy. The last week I've been walking with my grandpa (he walks daily, and can walk 3 miles with ease). Each day we've been walking for 2 miles on level surface and minimal inclines, with some steeper inclines depending which direction we go, and it takes about 50 minutes. 

I guess my biggest question is.. How long until walking stops being a form of torture? I'm 5'2"" and 240 lbs and have really never exercised in my life. It's definitely a cardio workout for me and my calves in particular get pretty tired. No cramping or anything severe, and everything calms down once I'm home and sit to relax for a bit. 

I'm fixing to have gastric sleeve surgery on Monday and I'm sure I'll have to work back up to walking that 60 minutes again (suggestion was to start with 10 minutes a couple times a day--I won't know what I can do until I'm in that position obviously. Hopefully I'll be able to start with more than 10.)

I'd like to be able to walk with him and have it be enjoyable.. But jeez it's discouraging to have each walk be painful and winded.

How long does it typically take to fall into a consistent walking routine?",Captain_Bug,self.Exercise,1590714998

Exercise,protein shake for weight loss,"Hi All,

should I drink protein shakes to lose weight as I try to gain muscle as well?

I am 5'8'' and in my early 20s and throughout my life I have gone from skinny to fat and vice versa every few years. Up until age 7 I was skinny, then I got really fat as a kid until I was 11 years old, then I was skinny until about 16 or 17 years old where I slowly gained alot of weight every year to the point where I was around 225 lbs by age 20. In the past year I have been able to drop from about 215 lbs to 175 lbs. I have been trying to lose weight for years and before last year I would lose 20 and gain 15 back on a regular basis. This past year is the first time since I was a kid that I have been able to lose past 20 lbs and continue to lose weight. I did it mainly by changing my diet and going to a personal trainer. I would like to lose about 15 more lbs of fat and gain muscle. I would just like to have a lean body and be able to see a 6 pack at least once in my life. I still have some fat in my stomach which is why i would like to lose 15 more lbs.

I tried drinking protein shakes about 2 years ago after the gym. This was when I was around 215 and was trying to exercise on my own but I didnt have enough motivation to do a good workout. I now go to a personal trainer who has his own boxing gym which has helped me alot in the past year and helped me find self motivation to do good workouts and workout more. I am considering drinking protein shakes again as I start to try and build muscle, but again I still have 15 more lbs I would like to lose. I want to try and do both at the same time. Im just worried that it will cause me to gain fat if I dont eat and do enough exercise properly. My weight has stayed pretty consistent recently.

My diet has not been anything specific, all I try to do is eat healthier. Breakfast I have a yogurt or banana. Lunch Ill have meat with vegetables. Dinner ill try to have similar to lunch but with slightly less portions. I'm not strict with this diet, sometimes ill add rice to the meal or sometimes ill have a cheat meal. When I snack, I do so with nuts or cheese. I mainly just drink water, if not then diet soda (which I swear i'm trying to quit). Lately with quarantining I have messed up my diet a bit because my job is giving us a free meal and a free drink (including diet soda) and the salad they make is pretty unsatisfying so sometimes i've gone for the less healthy meal.

Would it be smart for me to drink protein shakes while trying to lose weight? Im willing to change my diet slightly, if I have to.",ea0995,self.Exercise,1590632096

I was pretty active, walking quite a bit at college and maintaining a decent meal plan but being home has kinda messed me up. I’m currently around 196 pounds and I’m 5’9” so I definitely need to cut some weight down. Does anyone have any tips on what to do at home to cut down on some of this excess weight? I have a pretty large area to walk around since I live in the country and the only workout equipment I have is dumbbells but I also can play basketball at home. Also, what would a target heart rate be for working out? My resting heart rate is around 69 bpm and when I just worked out playing basketball at medium intensity and my heart rate was between 140 and 160 bpm. This feels too high but I’m not sure considering I have pretty bad health anxiety and I don’t know what target rate I should go for. Also should I attempt running or jogging or stick to walking? I try to walk between 30 minutes and an hour daily. I also don’t particularly know what to eat. I have protein powder and was considering drinking a shake in the mornings but wasn’t sure if I should. We’re also not the richest family and my parents don’t seem to care too much about getting healthier foods so what are some foods I could try to get that would help with my health?

Recently, I hurt my thumbs from gaming way too much. (Badass, I know) 

So I’ve started exercising for the first time in my life.i got myself a bike A week ago and have used it to help lose weight. 

I can’t ride my bike every day though it seems. It’s really getting painful sitting on that seat every day. I want to do stuff to build muscle, just slightly so I don’t look like just flesh. But I don’t know where to start whatsoever. 

I have no money for equipment. No money to hire a personal trainer. Gyms are closed. No friends that work out that can help.

Besides, if I do figure that out, I have other stuff that I can’t figure out.

I really overthink things. I don’t what exercises to do. There’s arm workouts, chest workouts, ab workouts, leg workouts. How do I figure out what exercises to do to make sure I get a full workout for each thing? I can’t fully focus on arms. I need to balance them all out so I don’t screw up my body years down the road

How often should I do them? How many reps? When should I stop? How so long should I work out for a day if I want to see results and not just feel them? How do I know if I’m pushing myself too hard or if I’m uncomfortable? Should I work multiple groups if males at once or just one group a day or two?

If I only do cardio, I start losing muscle tissue apparantly, I don’t want that. So I have to fit that in with all that other stuff too

Exercise,Questioning Sunny underdesk elliptical distance per hour calculations," Just got this Sunny brand underdesk elliptical. Figured when I am sitting  at the computer I can do something to keep moving. However watching its  little monitor it appears to be telling I traveled 4 miles in about 13  minutes. According to it my speed averaged 20 mph. While the speed to  time calculations are correct according to some online calculation  programs I used, something just doesn't seem right. I didn't expect that  I could cover that many miles in such a short span of time. Does an  elliptical single rotation calculate to cover more ground at the same  speed than a single pedal rotation on a exercise bike?",amn70,self.Exercise,1590509165
Exercise,I want a bike. Help! I'm overwhelmed!,"So I'm into cardio and I'm bored with jogging/walking. I would like a bike to exercise outside on nature trails around where I live. I ask bike experts and they just kind of scoff at me because I don't want to spend more than 500, but if I can go lower that would be ideal (I'm saving for a wedding and it's a plague so.). 

The consensus is that I won't get a good bike for that. I'm just looking for something to be comfortable on the butt, and to burn calories while enjoying the ride. I know the more you pay, the lighter the bike correct? Lighter would be better for me, I think, but I guess beggars can't be choosers.

Exercise,I hope this motivates you to keep on going...,"I’ve been walking +10K steps 6 days a week and it’s been really good. I saw a number on the scale that didn’t fit with my future self so I decided to change my lifestyle and permanently drop the excess weight. 

I walk around my neighbourhood and then I’m done for the day (it usually takes 8K steps, then the other 2K is just from random errands in or out the house).

The last I checked I was 17stones/238lbs at 5ft5. I’m sure 100lbs is in my chest but I constantly remind myself I didn’t get here overnight and to be kind to myself when I see my reflection in the mirror. It’s taken me 7 years to get to this weight and to drop the weight in &lt;1-2 years will be a huge accomplishment. 

So if anyone else is in the situation let’s be kind to ourselves. Keep away from the scale. Take pictures and enjoy the ride. One day very soon you’ll wake up and you’re at your goal weight. The journey will go fly by so enjoy it. You’re growing so much more than you think mentally/spiritually/emotionally and shrinking physically even if you can’t see it.

Exercise,How do you develop a healthy relationship with exercise?,"I'm a 19 year old girl who has been working out consistently for the past year now. Growing up I did competitive dance and was very busy and active, but always valued my rest time and knew when my body was sore. Recently, especially during quarantine where there isn't much to do, I have been feeling like no amount of exercise is ever enough - whenever I'm sitting down relaxing, I get anxious thinking about how I should be doing an ab circuit or taking a walk, and I get intense worry around the concept of taking a rest day. If I don't get in ""enough"" working out during a day, my mood changes and I feel so sluggish and worthless. I take every opportunity I can to walk somewhere instead of drive, do household chores, etc, all because I know that will add even more exercise to my day on top of whatever I have already done. Some days I will do 3+ HIIT sessions (usually around 250 calories burned each) on top of my daily 4-mile walk. I know this isn't healthy mentally or physically, but I have no idea where to even start reversing this mindset. I see results, I haven't gotten injured, and I always feel so much happier and fulfilled after I workout, so it's so hard to convince myself that sometimes it is okay to not be improving on myself and take a break.

Today I am sore as f*** and could only do half of the first video and three exercises of the second and had to stop.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can start slower? I really want to lose belly fat specifically and tone my abs. I am around 160lbs and I am pretty thick around my thighs and butt (which I don’t mind as much) but a little toning would be nice. I don’t want to give up!

Someone also told me that I have to reduce my overall bodyfat percentage before I can get abs... is that true? I have a very hard time losing weight because of my antipsychotic medication (Latuda). Just started Topamax to see if that will help with weight loss. 

Please let me know if you have any suggestions! I would greatly appreciate it!! 😊

To get better returns, you need to invest in mutual funds for a longer period, especially in a good scheme. Similarly, you need to invest in your health.

Like a good mutual fund scheme, we need to focus on what we are eating. If we eat organic and natural food, we will get good returns for a longer period of time. 

Now, having a knowledge of what is good for your body comes through experience.

 
Just like we need an experienced advisor to guide us on how to invest in a mutual scheme where we our get our desired goal, we need a health and wellness coach who can guide us to achieve our health goals.  ",Anshi1994,self.Exercise,1590310048

Exercise,Climbing stairs (functional),"I live at the fifth floor in a large apartment block.

Since the start of coronavirus pandemic, I've been avoiding the elevator for the fear of the virus.

Instead I climbed stairs.

To reach my apartment I have to climb 5 sets of stairs, each one has 17 stairs or so... and each one is around 3 meters tall. So in total I climb around 15 meters of height difference.

When I climb, I skip stairs, so I step on every second one.

I never do this exercise on purpose, for the exercise reasons. I just climb whenever I have to go back home after going anywhere outside.

On average, I climb around 3 times a day. But it depends on the day.

Still, I am wondering how good this is as an exercise? Will my legs get much stronger? I do find it easier to climb now than when I just started two months ago...

May I overtrain them if I do it every day? Could it mess with my heart if I get such high intensity exercise on totally irregular basis, but still almost every day... (But then I remember in my old building I lived on the fourth floor and there was no elevator, so I didn't even have a choice...)

I plan to keep doing this even after pandemic, because I feel it's a great exercise, and I don't have to do any planning... I just ignore the lift as if it didn't exist, and that's all.",hn-mc,self.Exercise,1590272179

I'm home every day and not going to work, or anywhere really, so I'm hoping to learn from here some exercise tips! I've been bike riding 5-8 miles every day for close to 8 months now as my regular routine, and since quarantine I've been walking about 2 miles a day. I've been lifting weights for a month or so now and watching what I'm eating. I've lost about 18 pounds (160 down to 142 as of yesterday) in the 2 months I've been home. 
Any suggestions on trying to start running? I haven't done anything in 7 years. 
What are some exercising using weights without a bench to build some muscle? I have a dumb-bell set and a barbell.
Finally, what are some good core workouts that won't hurt my back or shoulder? I've had injuries in the past that make it painful to do crunches and side planks. I've been doing a standard plank 3 minutes a day as my only core workout.

My problem is that i feel like my leg workout might be a bit quad dominant and could use some advice on when I should add/remove to help with strengthening my hamstrings.

Equipment:
Resistance Bands
Loop bands
Pull up bar (not that this helps)
1 Dumbbell (adjustable, up to 30lbs)

Workout:

Banded Lunges 3 x 12
Banded Squats 4 x 12
Single Leg Glute Bridge 3 x 12
Banded Leg Curls 3 x 12
Banded Leg Extension 3 x 12
Banded Wall Squat 3 x 12 + Calf Raises superset 3 x 30
Plank - 1 minute
Side Planks - 1 minute
Abdominal Pendulums - 3 x 12
Crunches - 3 x 15

My diet is now really good. I hit all the nutritional targets and eat very healthy foods. Zero junk food, zero processed foods, zero added sugar, low sodium... you get the idea. My caloric intake is good, with usually a little extra (in the hopes it will turn into weight gain).

The thing is I still don't gain weight, and my muscles are super small. I look ill due to being so rail thin... I'm actually slightly underweight.

Every day I do a 45 minute yoga routine, work with some hand weights until I can't do anymore, and walk 4km.

Exercise,2 Ways Exercise Affects Your Memory,"Everyone  knows exercise is good for you. Even a little does a lot.  But while  it’s easy to see the physical improvements, you may be shocked  to learn  there are many mental improvements that come with increased  movement.  Here’s a list of ways exercise affects your memory.

# 1- Exercise increases oxygen intake in the brain

Not  only is the brain the seat of awareness, it’s also the control  center  for the whole rest of the body. People tend to forget (no pun  intended)  that their brain has physical needs like any other organ —  oxygen,  blood, etc. That’s where even a little bit of exercise can get  you some  results. Simply learning to breathe deeply and calmly is enough  to  increase oxygen intake in the brain, which powers the whole system. 

 So,  a good workout will not only increase your lung capacity and  regulate  your insulin levels, it will also supercharge your brain  capacity so  you can go on to do mental things.

# 2- Exercise strengthens neural connections

Studies  have shown that a form of physical exercise that also  incorporates a  mental challenge — say, ballroom dancing or a team sport —  does more  for the brain than either plain physical exercise or plain  mental  exercise (such as completing puzzles). While your imagination may  be  boundless, brains are pretty much locked into a finite system. 

 Although  your brain does grow rapidly in your early years, by the time  you  reach young adulthood you’ve pretty much finished the physical   construction (as in, brain cells). Everything you do after that is   simply connecting and reconnecting your neurons to each other to make   new memories and associations. You have one set of connecting blocks to   play with. If you lose some of them, you can’t go to the store and buy   more. That’s why it’s vital to keep the ones you have going for as long   as you can, and exercise is the key to that.

Exercise,"Trouble with consistency, advice?","Hey all!

Wondering if any of you have managed to overcome an inconsistent lifestyle and can offer advice?

I've always yo-yo'd when it comes to eating healthily and exercise, I'm in a ""good"" phase right now. I'm running, I'm eating regular meals. But I'm worried about when life starts again and distractions, work, stress etc make me fall off the wagon. Every time I get into a healthy pattern it inevitable falls apart and I'm back to giving excuses, impulse buying unhealthy snacks and berating myself for lack of self control.

As odd as it sounds, I think a large part of my problem is that when I do decide to commit and exercise, I get into it fairly easily and my body responds to exercise relatively quickly. It's as though i'm subconsciously like ""I can put this off because I can always get back into it"". If that makes sense?

Exercise,Advice on selecting a knee brace and rehabbing runners knee,"Hello, A couple weeks ago I stupidly over-extended myself while running, and a day or two later, I was feeling a sore knee. 

After a few days of light jogging, and feeling slight pain, I decided to stop running all together until I am certain I am recovered. I have not ran in about a week. I have been taking ibuprofen daily to reduce swelling, as well as icing my knee every few hours.

I also decided I would like to have some sort of support for when I go up and down stairs, walk longer than I'd prefer while resting, and to wear when I eventually get back into running. Could you point me in the right direction as to what I should look for in a knee brace? How often should I wear it?

Lastly, how should I approach my rehab? I found some exercises and stretches to avoid injury, but I feel that these stretches would only prolong my injury at this point. Should I stay completely off it, or try stretching myself out for the next week or two?",blew_turkey,self.Exercise,1589806769
Exercise,Any Advice?,"Hey Everyone; Love this group and reading about all your routines.
I'm looking for some advice; I recently got myself a smart scale which is allowing me to track alot more of my body stats, Things like BMI, Body fat percentage, BMR, etc.

I'm exercising pretty regularly, especially since lockdown kicked in. I do a solid 20 mins of core, 20 mins or weights (chest/arms) followed by an hour on the bike. I do this 3-4 times a week. 
Feeling very energised and really enjoying it. I'm finding it difficult though to shift that last few percent of body fat so i can reach the goal of seeing my abs.

I know they're there as i can feel them, and due to the amount of abs workouts i've done. I've been finding that weighing myself regularly, i see my weight fluctuate often and not on a steady decline. I guess it's not healthy to weight yourself everyday?

Currently coming in at 68.85kg, I'm happy with my weight I just want to shift that last little bit of body fat. 

Any advice? Is there any extra exercises i could be doing? Or is it all about food?",Jmeashworth,self.Exercise,1589804873

Exercise,It does get better? Having a hard time with a simple workout.,"It does get better? Having a hard time with a simple workout.

F26, 5'3 and 207lbs.

I always been a sedentary person. When I was 22 I decided to change that and I was able to go from 187lbs to 154 by doing low carb and running for 30-40 minutes. I was proud of myself.

I mainteined my weight until I was 24. Then everything went down. I had a psychotic break which turned me into an alcoholic. I was drinking almost half a bottle of vodka or wine each day to keep the hallucinations away cause I didn't know they were hallucinations. As you can imagine things got messy. Got into ER due pancreatitis and couldn't eat anything. Diagnosed anorexia or what they call ""drunkorexia"". I was at 130 lbs, my ideal weight but I lost too fast which isn't healthy at all. I was weak and couldn't enjoy anything.

My recovering is going well right now (both physical and psychological). I'm at a point where I'm in control. But I gained a lot of weight without the drinking thing. This makes me sad and hopeless. I'm now at 207 lbs, my worst. 

I don't have a problem with my diet. I feel like I can follow a healthy diet forever and stick to 1000 calories each day. The thing is, I'm again extremely sedentary. I started a 30 min low impact workout on Friday. The whole thing seems easy to follow but I can't imagine myself doing till the end. Too much pain and fatigue.

On the first day, I did 10 min. The second day, 11. Today, 13 min.

I pause a lot. Does it get better? It seems like I'll never be one of those people who can do a 30 minute workout again. I know I can't stop and I don't plan to do it at all but I can't help to feel extremely discouraged.",dreamlunadream,self.Exercise,1589744141

Exercise,"The best and simple Home (Office) Corona workout, period!","After 8 weeks of home office I came up with something solid for you muscle builders and workout freaks out there. This is as simple as it can get and requires nothing but adjustable dumbbells, plates and a bit of space. More explanations further down, let's get to the nitty gritty:

Day1: Overhead Press / Pushups / Triceps OH Extensions

Day2: Upright Rows / Bent Over Rows / Curls

Day3: Squats / Goblet Squats / Air Squats

Day4: Day1

Day5: Day 2

As you can see, it's a Push/Pull/Legs/Push/Pull routine. The legs lag a bit behind in this routine, because we only have DBs, but we are home bound, so we keep it SIMPLE! You will get HIGH reps and burning legs, so it makes up for the light weight a bit.

Now, the best part: You only need to change plates once or twice a week, depending on your progression. There is NO warmup needed!

Every exercise is 3 sets as many reps as possible. 

If you can do 15 reps on your first set of Overhead Presses, you increase the weight once you do Overhead Presses again. Not before! Simple, right? So you wil do every exercise (aside from Pushups and Air Squats obviously) with the same set of dumbbells at least once. 

Rest between sets is 1 minute. Rest between exercises is 1 minute. You can do this workout in your home office lunch break. Takes about 15-20 minutes  or so. Then have your protein shake.

The least amount of weight you can increase the dumbbells, the better. Personally I can increase EACH db by 0.5kg. So order yourself some microplates, because dbs are more difficult than barbells. And more awesome! Make sure your dbs can carry a bit of weight, otherwise you have the wrong 'bells.

At your 15 rep max, you dont need warmups. It's light enough to pull off right away and heavy enough to cause hypertrophy. If anybody tells you otherwise, punch them in the face and get back to your workout!

Exercise order is mandatory. Dont switch around!

A few notes:

- Triceps Overhead Extensions: Seated, one db, two hands on one side of the the plates. Lower behind your head, extend over your head.

- Curls: This is a bit tricky. The best thing i came up with is, do them standing and grab one db with both hands at the plates and curls them up. You will feel them in your biceps but also increase your grip and forearm strength. It's awesome, do it!

- upright rows, I know some people complain about them being bad for your wrists and shoulders. I agree... if you use a barbell. But we use dumbells. The bells dont move parallel to the ground, but in an angle (thumbs higher than pinkies). Keep the dbs in front of your thighs, naturally and pull them up in a natural path until your thumbs touch your nipples. This way you not only work your side delts but also your traps.

- as many reps as possible per set, that means, go until you cant finish the rep and get stuck mid way and your eyes pop out. Exercises are safe, unlike for example Barbell Bench Press, where this will hurt or kill you, unless you have a good spotter.

One pair of dumbbells, plate change for the lazy plate changer, high frequency training, moderate frequency per muscle group, moderate volume, moderate intensity, minimal equipment, pump, progressive overload, increased strength, home office compatible.

Exercise,Looking for suggestions,"Hi everyone. I (34F) had gastric bypass surgery in September 2019. I went from 246lbs to my current weight of 140lbs since then (weight loss at this rate is normal for the first 6 to 8 months). The past 7 months have not been easy, and I lost a lot of muscle mass. I've had trouble keeping a lot of food down over that time so any exercise beyond just walking has been pretty much impossible because I had no energy and got tired really easily. At some points it was difficult for me to even stand in the shower, that's how weak I was. (Please don't be alarmed, I've been working with my doctor and surgeon about all of this)

Recently, I've been doing much much better. I've been able to eat and keep food down for the most part so my energy levels are a lot higher than they were. I was hoping for some suggestions on muscle building exercises, as I resemble that of a wet noodle. I really like strength training but I want to start out slow because I'm really worried about the fatigue. Everything I found on line is like ""lose weight super fast!!!!!"" I don't want to lose any more weight. While I understand that can sometimes go hand in hand.... I guess I'm just trying to figure out if there are better exercises than others that focus more on muscle building than fat loss. Does that make sense?

Exercise,Ma Gains! :(,"Good afternoon, it has been 2 weeks without the herb. Sleep is finally getting better and the foggy mind I once had is clearing out. Currently, I am a little concerned about my weight. I used to get stoned and lift, also run. Last year while using mass gainer and Torrent I reached 220lbs which is cool for a 6'4 male.

I was still in a haze but saw I was at 206ish about 2 weeks ago. I am now at week 2 and decided to step on the scale and today I am at 198, I still exercise the same amount and lift the same weight without issue. It just makes my mind race seeing such a big drop. I am pretty sure it's just this loss of appetite, seems I can fill up on less and even missed lunch a few days without noticing.

I've got to assume my lack of caloric intake is the reason as before I could eat all day being a high on. Even with this assumption, it makes me freak out.  I can't get stoned to calm down so I just need to hear some other people's thoughts.

If you care to read what exercises I perform:

My routine is 5 days a week, I do 5 sets of 10 pull-ups, 3 sets of 12 mil press at 125lbs, a variation of incline(160) or standard bench(180) at 3x12 depending on the day, followed by 3x12 skulls at 90lbs, and 3 minutes of side planks for the left and right with a 10 lb weight above my head. I then run 5 miles between these 3 lift days.

Lately, all I can eat is like 2 eggs in the AM sometimes cottage cheese or lunch meat around noon and about half of what I usually eat for dinner serving of a protein and veggies.",Dieseltonic,self.Exercise,1589142280
Exercise,What would be the best way for me to put on muscle?,"I've always been really skinny no matter what I eat, or how much exercising I do. I did weight lifting 5 days a week for 4 years and I didnt get any bigger, the main reason I was able to go up in weight is because my technique got really good. I made sure I was eating right and getting a lot of protein, but I only saw a very slight change and only gained around 8lbs over that 4 year period. It's been 2 years now since Ive exercised or lifted weights at all, and over the past few months I decided to start eating about 2x what I usually would so I could at least put on some fat hoping it might make me look better, and I managed to go up from 130lbs to 165lbs. I was happy that I actually gained weight for once in my life, but I dont look any different than I did at 130 other than my stomach now having a layer of fat over it. My arms and legs are just as skinny as they have always been. I wanted to get back into exercising, but I want to know first, what exercises would be the best for me to see actual results? I used to ratate upper body lifting and lower body lifting each day, 5 days a week with heavy weight and low reps, but that didnt work for me, so what would actually make me gain muscle?

Exercise,Criminally underrated exercises,"Feel free to add your own,   but there are 3 types of exercises which need to be used more.

1. Crawling.   Yes,   now think about how astronauts that spend  long time in zero gravity,   they work out intensely every single day yet still their legs shrink greatly and they have great problems adapting to walking when they get back to earth.   Now think about how people spend all this time in the gym doing bench presses and military presses and chest flies, et cetera.......these people are not unlike astronauts in zero gravity, instead of their legs it's their arms and chest and abs which are suffering from zero gravity all the time.    Regular gym exercises are futile in combating the deleterious effects of zero G.  All you have to do is reintroduce your upper body to gravity.  It's simple locomotion which makes you strong, the natural use of your limbs as an animal would do or a wildman.   My hypothesis is that the vibration of constant daily locomotion is what does the most stimulation of muscle growth-  not being a heavy weight try-hard.   And no,  regular push-ups are not sufficient,  why?  they are only isolating a few muscles,  they aren't using a full range,  they aren't engaging the abs,  legs,  and cardio,  they aren't giving the vibrational stress necessary for growing strong bones via Wolff's Law.
2. Swimming.   Why is this underrated?  Because,  statistically,  half of the world population can't even swim. ............... yeah,  holy fucking cow.   Drowning is a  top tier cause of mortality as well  because people are just too lazy to learn how to swim, it's really quite sad.   If I, myself, can swim over the thickest forests of seaweed with literally zero difficulty then anybody then even little kids should be able to safely swim in clear waters.  Also,  it's amazing for muscle power,  no other exercise can resistance train every muscle in every direction.   It even trains your lung power by pressurizing your chest cavity.   God,  why can't half the population swim?
3. Climbing.   No one climbs anymore,   back in the 90's us kids were practically monkeys,  everytime I even went near a tree I had to check them to make sure no one was going to drop on me.    Now, what has the world devolved into?  People are too cowardly to even leave their houses.   Grow a pair,   grab a tree limb.  This is how I trained for Judo and Jiu Jitsu,  gripping,  biceps,  back strength,  it will only get better and better,  I don't care how lazy you think you are,just do this one weird trick,   Doctors hate this.  Also,  it should ameliorate your back pain,  swelling back muscles have been known to correct the spine   and the stretch involved helps too.
4. Chopping wood.  Think about it,  you could be a lumberjack for a very small price.   Get a hatchet, not an axe,  with an axe the wood will split too easily.  Chop against the grain because chopping with the grain makes the wood split too easy.   Your goal is not to split the wood but to develop explosive arm power.  This was the go-to exercise for boxing champions,  the man who beat Jack Dempsey (Gene Tunney) did this.  He did this one weird trick, doctors hate him.",JackyFine,self.Exercise,1589132632

Exercise,Finally feeling proud of myself!,"I don't think anyone will care or read this, but I am proud to be exercising again! 

I used to go to martial arts classes 3-4 days a week all the way up until the end of high school when I simply didn't have enough time anymore. In most of my college years, I've been neglecting exercise because I was feeling depressed and had symptoms of anxiety, and nothing was motivating me anymore. Now that it's quarantine, I feel more out of shape than ever because I am unable to just walk home from my bus stop or just stroll around Central Park because school is now virtual. 

I was scrolling through my Reddit feed the other day and saw someone posted a pic on r/Instagramreality on Sanity Sunday (which, if you don't know, posts realistic pictures of everyday people without any edits or filters) that really caught my eye. It was a simple side-by-side image of a YouTuber when her abs are showing and her bloating. I read through the comments and found out a lot of people follow her exercises, so I asked someone who commented and found out her name was Chloe Ting.

I didn't want to know what her channel was about before starting, so I just took out my yoga mat, put up her most popular video (the 2-week abs challenge) and started. When I was finished, I was tired, my abs burned, and I was sweating, which hasn't happened to me in a few years (I don't sweat, even if it's hot)! I decided I will continue because I have nothing else to do anyway, and I was determined to get back to a good habit. 

Now, after a week, I am finding the exercises easier, and I am following four of her videos a day (abs, arms, full body, and stretching). By the end of this pandemic lockdown, I hope I won't make excuses about not exercising anymore.

Exercise,Exercise and COVID-19: How antioxidants released during exercise may reduce symptom severity,"  

https://preview.redd.it/mlsaf80dh6x41.jpg?width=3117&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e15be01bef7ba79bfb4f8fe3145558192cd7b792

As seen in [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/202005/exercise-and-covid-19).

The benefits of regular exercise are extremely well documented. Without pause, stories have been published for years about how exercise pays physical and psychological dividends with few, if any, drawbacks. Meanwhile, evidence continues to mount that a multitude of chronic illnesses are associated with a sedentary lifestyle, especially if it is coupled with a diet that is high in processed sugars, saturated fats, and an abundance of starchy and empty carbohydrates. 

To avoid these health risks, maintain a healthy weight, and promote wellness, even limited exercise can be extremely beneficial. It has been linked with improved mood and data suggests that this is because it can positively impact one’s [brain chemistry](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/blog/balanced/202001/the-link-between-bdnf-and-neuroplasticity?amp) and hormonal levels. To this latter point, recent studies have even found that it can make many of the symptoms associated with [menopause](https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/topics/mood-disorders/depressive-disorder/level-of-exercise-around-menopause-associated-with-depressive-symptoms/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pa-update-hay-20200429&amp;cpn=&amp;hmSubId=pv3Qmv2qXHM1&amp;hmEmail=P51me_23PBRLhB1fcUsBWN9Sz-y1cfMN0&amp;NID=&amp;email_hash=af9a108ea54dc96512f23378f8dc4294&amp;mpweb=1323-91103-6526877) more manageable. 

In addition to these benefits, regular exercise may strengthen individuals’ immune systems. While a healthy immune system is always important, it has become invaluable during the coronavirus pandemic. True, exercise cannot prevent one from being infected with the virus, but recent [research](https://www.newsweek.com/study-suggests-regular-exercise-can-prevent-coronavirus-patients-developing-severe-complications-1498672) out of the University of Virginia suggests that exercise may prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears to affect between 3 percent and 17 percent of COVID-19 patients. It is one of the deadliest complications associated with the disease. The study found that 45 percent of patients who develop COVID-related ARDS will die.

## Exercise and the Antioxidant EcSOD

Exercise does not fight the virus itself or grant individuals some kind of special immunity. Rather, the Virginia study found that exercise increases the production of an antioxidant produced in the muscles known as extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD). In addition to increasing EcSOD levels in existing muscle tissue, more exercise, particularly weight training, also produces more muscle tissue. More muscle tissue means an increase in the potential amount of EcSOD that the body can produce. 

Once secreted into the bloodstream, EcSOD is then redistributed throughout the body to protect cells by serving as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. For patients with ARDS, this means EcSOD is sent to the lungs to reduce the inflammation there. As the danger posed by ARDS depends upon how widespread the inflammation in the lungs becomes, and consequently how much the inflammation deprives the body of oxygen, EcSOD levels could be the difference between a mild case of ARDS and a deadly one.

Dr. Zhen Yan, the author of the review, believes that EcSOD may be used as a potential treatment for a wide variety of conditions in addition to ARDS, though research into the full spectrum of its effects is still in its infancy. EcSOD’s potency as an anti-inflammatory agent relative to others that exist in our body and diet is still being studied.

## Obesity as a Risk Factor

As Dr. Yan asserts, EcSOD levels could at least partially account for the disparities in symptoms among individuals infected with the novel coronavirus. Unfortunately, ARDS is not the sole complication that arises from the disease, and it is likely that EcSOD levels are but one factor impacting how ill patients become. As the virus is still new and comprehensive studies have yet to be conducted, there are far more questions about the virus and the illness it causes than there are definitive answers. 

However, initial research and anecdotal evidence from hospital workers does suggest that there are numerous risk factors that can make a severe case of COVID-19 more probable. It has been widely reported that those who are immunocompromised or over the age of 65 are at a higher risk for severe illness, as are those with any one of the [following conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/underlying-conditions.html):

· Chronic kidney disease

· Chronic lung disease

· Diabetes

· Liver disease

· Moderate to severe asthma

· Serious heart conditions

Yet another factor that appears to exist independent of diabetes is obesity, especially if one has a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher. [Studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-obesity-higher-risk.html) are finding that obesity may be second only to age in determining whether or not a person becomes critically ill with the disease.

Researchers are not certain why obesity seems to independently make patients more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms, but it is possible that it could also be tied to inflammation. Researchers have found that adipose tissue (fat) secretes cytokines that trigger inflammation. The more adipose tissue in the body, the more the body remains in a state of low-grade and chronic inflammation that has been shown to make individuals more susceptible to certain viral infections—most notably severe strains of [influenza](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-impact-of-obesity-on-immune-response-to-infection-and-vaccine-an-insight-into-plausible-mechanisms-2161-1017.1000113.pdf) like 2009’s H1N1.

If this is true, one can think of an increase in adipose tissue as having the opposite effects on the immune system as an increase in muscle tissue. The former hinders patients’ immune systems during incidents of infection, while the latter enhances them. Consequently, any effort to reduce one’s BMI, provided one is obese, could potentially reduce the risk of developing complications associated with COVID-19. 

The fact that exercise can reduce obesity and leads to the increased production of EcSOD are two more reasons why everyone should try to find at least 150 minutes to exercise each week, provided they are physically able to do so.",SamoonAhmadMD,self.Exercise,1588785462

Exercise,How does exercise help with weight loss when everything I read keeps telling me it slows weight loss down?,"Hi there,

So not sure if allowed, but I have just flipped that switch in my head somewhere I guess that's made me not want to fail again at weight loss. I'm very overweight. And I guess researching a lot lately about how to lose weight fast. Naturally. We all want it to be fast. 

And I know diet is like 75% of the journey, but everything I read about exercise talks about slowing weight loss down. That of you cut 500 calories from food and exercised for an equivalent of 500 calories, you wouldn't be a 1000 calorie deficit because you HAVE to eat at least 300 calories for every hour exercised? 

I just, don't understand how you can exercise to aid in weight loss when it apparently slows your weight loss down, and requires you eat even more calories on top of the exercise anyway. 

I was hoping people could help explain perhaps how that makes sense, how to lose weight with diet and exercise if exercise is what slows it down. Not looking for health advice or advice for me, just the general information of exercise as a tool I guess.",buggle_bunny,self.Exercise,1588764182

So, I'm a""class"" guy. Before quarantine I did a mix of Orangetheory and Barrys (I would do only Barry's if I could afford it - and there's an Orangetheory on my corner ...but OT was actually pretty good ...). Since quarantine, I've found that I like Peloton strength classes. They leave me pretty sore and I like that there are a ton, and you can choose a focus, etc. I usually do a 30 min upper or lower, and then a 10min core and then, if I'm feeling up for it, a shorter arms to finish things off. 

Just curious if anyone out here has started using Peloton strength classes during quarantine and, if so, what they think of them. Also, do you think 30mins (and after warm-up and talking between sets, probably closer to 18 mins) is enough to build muscle and get lean/toned/definition?

My balance is a lot better on my left side, but I seem to be more flexible on my right side. And when I stretch, it seems as though no stretch is enough as it feels amazing on both sides.

I'm starting to think that it may be the shoes that I wear when I work out. I use Nike's that I received as a gift and I'm preety sure they are for running. Because they are very light and have a very flexible sole.

I'm a lazy bloke with terrible stamina, but I love learning new, difficult skills like solving the Rubiks cube, throwing cards, spinning a basketball, nerd stuff like that, and when I start to learn something new, I go all in and master that shit. So I recently I picked up juggling, and I realized that it's making me really tired, so I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I found some physical activity that I can just learn to master, have fun doing it and finally get some exercise in my daily routine. 

So the question is, are you guys aware of any single physical activity that's considered difficult to master and allows you to do tricks and doesn't require going outside. a good example of what I mean would be jumping rope, but I've got a small apartment so I'd probably end up wrecking everything.

For me it isn't hard to build my chest, biceps, calves, quads.

I can get strong with glutes but it never grows larger.

Lats are my biggest issue. The rest of the back is alright but for some reason I can't increase my pull ups too much.

If I do them more often during the week I end up over fatiguing and can't complete sets.

I've tried once a week with increasing reps but after a while I fatigue again. 

I thought that maybe because I'm in the process of weight loss that this may be an issue but my legs, biceps and chest are at least maintaining strength.

 I used to be able to do pullups with added weight but as I've lost weight I'm only able to bodyweight pull ups while keeping same amount of reps. If I add weight my reps decrease.",CoolFiverIsABabe,self.Exercise,1588304396

Exercise,"Fitness/Weight loss regimen. Advice, critiques, and comments wanted and appreciated!","I've been calorie counting for about a year now, (year and five days, to be specific) and had made some progress the year before that by weening off of soda. In total, I've lost almost 60 pounds (27.2 kg). Should mention, I'm a 5'10"" male and started at 229 lbs. Approx 172 lbs now.

Recently, I've started a fitness regimen designed to both exacerbate my weight loss and increase my level of fitness. Strength &amp; muscle definition and toning are a new goal alongside just weight loss. This is my current routine:

Workout three days a week; Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Stretch everyday. Consume 1,500-1,700 calories per-day. Ideal is to exercise until failure, but I often end up tired, sore, and hungry before I push *too* hard. So, I'll list the average number of reps.

&amp;#x200B;

Monday - 30 diamond push-ups, 30 CrossFit burpees, 60 sit-ups, 30 stomach contractions (my name for sucking in the stomach and holding for 5 seconds, in order to work the transverse abdominis),  30 Hindu push-ups, 30 back-bridges, 60 mountain climbers, 30 inverted back rows.

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday - 30 diamond push-ups, 30 CrossFit burpees, 60 sit-ups, 30 stomach contractions, 20 walking lunges, 30 Hindu squats, 30 sumo squats, 50 grasshoppers.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday - 30 diamond push-ups, 30 CrossFit burpees, 60 sit-ups, 30 stomach contractions, 30 prison cell push-ups, 30 walking push-ups, 30 plank rotations, tricep dips (on the floor).

&amp;#x200B;

As you can probably tell, I work the upper-arms and abdomen pretty heavily. That's largely due to 2 factors. Firstly, well-defined biceps &amp; triceps are a main goal. Secondly, I already have a fairly strong core, so I'm trying to compound that to achieve a muscular stomach once I get all the fat out of the way.",Delnilas,self.Exercise,1588268720

The workout focuses on the upper, lower, and sides of the abs, and I’ve really been feeling it and seeing a little improvement for the upper and the sides. However, I’m not happy with the progress of the lower, which is kind of my main focus. 

The workout has you do Marches for the lower, but I’m just not feeling much or anything at all when I do them. I’m hoping that I can find something still in the beginner/simple range that I can replace the 30 seconds of Marches with to get better results in my lower abs.

Exercise,stress around working out is ruining my life?,"hi- I am a D1 college athlete, and I *think* i like working out. I definitely like how it makes me feel afterwards! However, for the past couple years, it has been very common for me to have panic attacks before even an easy 70 minute jog because of the stress I associate with working out. It's too much to get into all the details here, but I basically cannot work out without this overwhelming feeling. 

It is basically ruining my life. I cry almost every day because of it, I hate my body a LOT, think about suicide a lot (even though I would never carry through), and am also stressed about my food because I don't know if I should be gaining or losing weight. In short, it's taking up most of my waking thoughts. 

I have never been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, mostly because I don't want them to break confidentiality and report me. I can't tell anyone else about this. 

How do you guys enjoy working out, and how can I incorporate things that have helped you to enjoy working out into my daily schedule?

Exercise,Reversing Effects of Sedentary Lifestyle,"I'm in a one year post bacc medical program that has basically been non stop since May. For the last 11 or so months I've been on my butt studying from sun up to sun down. 

Previously I was very active and lifted weights. When I started my program in May '19, I still tried staying active (long walks between classes, working out at the hospital gym, etc.)  but I stopped going as a result of constant homeowork and studying. I also fell into a bit of a depression and haven't really gotten much exercise. I sit almost all day and sometimes I have pains in my legs so I stand up while studying. I also go on walks when my boyfriend urges me to.

Occasionally, I pop on some Yoga with Adriene or at home workouts and do that but I have this sense that I should get back to studying for fear I won't cover everything I need to know for our next exam (we have an exam every week on Fridays and 1-2 times a month an exam on Monday + the other information we need to know for our other classes) or I will fail and have to do more work on top of not having time to do the work I have to do as well.

I eat about 1600 calories a day and have been tracking my macros on myfittnesspal. My goal macros are 30/35/35% with carbs, protein, and fat. I only eat whole wheat carbs and avoid white rice and white bread. I also drink about 70oz of water a day. 

My workout has consisted of mostly strength training with dumbells and resistance bands. I did full body workouts the first week and then split up my body for different days. I increased the intensity and weights as I progressed. I tried introducing some cardio but I've really struggled with that. 

I tried to get 10000 steps a day in a treadmill to try and keep myself active but I just can't find the energy. I'm pretty lazy and mostly sedentary when I'm not working out but post workout I'm exhausted so I just wanna lay around and do nothing. I tried moving my workouts from the afternoon to the evening but I'm even more exhausted at the end of the day. I spend most of my day on a computer so it doesn't help with the sedentary part.

Exercise,How to lose fat when you're already quite muscular," I (23/f) was a swimmer for 11 years, until my lungs gave out because of H1n1 at 16 years old and I had to quit. Since my early teen years I always had fleshy and weak arms, while my legs were strong and sculpted even when I put on weight after H1n1. (Important to note that I played piano for 15 years and my shoulders were constantly in pain since I was 13. They're still quite weak despite years of physiotherapy and then strength training, but they don't hurt nearly as much. Maybe that has something to do with my incapacity to have muscular arms, if that's what's happening.) I put on about 10kg/22lbs that I have since lost. I spent some years working out very irregularly due to depression and eating disorders but got my shit somewhat together last year and was working out 6x a week since April/2019 when I joined a really great  gym. My routine was 2 days upper body/1 day lower body with one day of rest between each 3 training sessions, yoga, cardio and some running, and still my legs got way more defined than my arms and back.

By the time quarantine started, I had already left the gym because I moved away, but I kept working out at home with simple equipment (ankle weights, 1kg dumbbells, yoga mat). 
As of now I haven't worked out in 2, 3, or maybe 4 weeks (quarantine got me down real bad), I miss running and long walks. I'm 167cm and weight something between 64-67kg (I don't own a scale and have body dysmorphia so this is as accurate as I can be).

Exercise,need squatting advice (vmo pain),"hey everyone, so for the past month or so i’ve been squatting pretty frequently compared to what i used to. although i’ve always been an athlete my whole life, i’m kind of focusing more on strength training rather than cardio. but every time i squat my vastus medialis (vmo) hurts a lot. usually feel it within the first 1-2 sets. then it hurts when i do my cardio after. even after taking a couple rest days on my legs it feels like it never fully heals and it’s always a problem on leg day. any tips? is it my form? or is it just simply a new muscle being activated that needs some getting used to? Thank you!",kathmaloney,self.Exercise,1587775062
Exercise,I want to gain muscle but don't know how to keep going.,"I say this a lot, and sometime ask for advise to this on different platforms, but I find workouts to be boring. I can take the pain, I just cant take the boredom. I rather do activities not workouts. Call me childish for that but it's true. I last longer when I'm playing tag instead of running around a track. 
 
I could do this, ut I have no one to do these things with, or the money. I mean come on, what other adult would want to play a childish game of tag? Furthermore, what teenager would want to play with an adult? And with the money, I cant afford to go to the pool all the time or rock climb, and again, I'd be doing these things alone cause no one seems interested. 

My sisters are starting to work out but they are twins and share a room. They have each other. I tried talking them into having me join in but they always have an excuse. ""Our room is too small""   Fair...how about out side?  ""The ground is too hard""   Okay...just chill on your beds or chill in my room while I exercise?  ""Why would we watch you exercise?"" 

So...I have no company and it doesn't help that I have poor social skills and have no friends. Not my sisters fault of course but they are the only company I have until I get my social skills worked out.

Music doesn't help. 

What can I do? Because it sounds like there is nothing I can do other then just force myself into doing the exercises.",Only_Us,self.Exercise,1587772380

Warm up for 5ish minutes, then jog until my breathing was labored/my legs were hurting, then resume walking until ready to continue, repeat. Walk/run covered about 0.7 miles total. Do this 3 days a week.

The rest of the day and following day my calves ached. Expected as much and didn’t think  anything of it. On the third day (today) they still hurt. Not just ache, they hurt when I use them. 

Did I not stretch them right? 
Did I do too much for my current level?
What are some good stretches for pre-running? (I’m going to just google this, but I figured I’d ask while I’m here)
I forgot to cool down after, depreciate my walking speed. Could that cause it?

Exercise,Suggestions on how to improve shoulder stability?,"Hi gentlemen,

I'm an 18 year old guy, I started working out 6 months ago but am having some problems with my shoulder. 

I work out at home, I first did calisthenics but now I also use resistance bands for isolation exercises.

When I first started, I had little knowledge, I naively did a lot of push ups, sit ups and squats. I did no pull ups at all.

So, what happened is the following, I noticed that both of my arms would click if I internally rotated them and that my left arm would click when laterally raised. 

Plus that I noticed that my shoulders became rounded and that my posture wasn't good.

So, I stopped all exercises and started working only on :
- rear deltoid
- external rotators of the rotator cuff
- upper back
- biceps, triceps and forearm
- serratus anterior (because I had and still have scapular winging (especially in my right shoulder))


After a few months of training, all I can say is that my posture improved greatly, my shoulders look great and my back is stronger.

But the problem is I can't get my shoulder clicking free, the clicking isn't painful, but it's weird and feels not right.

My left shoulder now clicks when I front raise it, it clicks multiple times when abducted to the side and then rotated externally and internally. My right shoulder is more quieter and doesn't click when front raised (even though it is supposed to be more rounded or internally rotated than my left shoulder)

Now the question is, what did I do wrong? What did I miss? Did I move from an imbalance to an imbalance?

Are my external rotators now overtaking my internal ones?

I was advised not to stretch them, could they be tight?

I'm quite desperate since I wanna get back and train my lats, chest and front delts again but at the same time I am afraid that doing so would be a suicide for my shoulders.",Abdoh_Ash,self.Exercise,1587281877

Exercise,Volume vs intensity when not targeting gains," 

A certain virus has made my normal form of exercise (surfing) illegal so I’ve been working out at home. I’ve also been trying to learn about exercise science, which has been equal parts enlightening and confusing. I have a question, and I’d like to say thanks in advance for any answers or information. 

I have a little circuit that brings me to fatigue after 5 rounds. 

If I cut the reps in half and do ten rounds, I’m not as fatigued and therefore could do more rounds. What are the benefits of that? And am I losing something by not pushing myself to exhaustion? 

And what if I spaced the rounds out throughout the day, thereby increasing the volume further. I know I’d lose the cardio/endurance benefits, but would I stand to lose anything else? 

Note: I am not trying to put on muscle. I’m just genuinely curious about how this all works.",powersurfer11,self.Exercise,1587237611
Exercise,Am I the only one who does not care for bike riding as an 'IDEAL' source of cardio?,"A friend of mine is an avid bike rider. He is obsessed with it. He has the expensive mountain bike, helmet, layers of clothing, etc.. Essentially, is always geared up and ready to go. 
I am on the opposite end of the spectrum. I am a bodybuilder who loves lifting heavy weights. I never was into cardio. Now, I am incorporating it into my weekly routine just to maintain good heart health. 
Anyway, my friend kept irritating me and practically begged me to go riding one night. He kept describing it as the best thing since sliced bread.

We ended up riding for nearly 3 hours one evening. By the time it was over, I felt like it didn't really have that much of an effect on me. Sure it wasn't easy and he outperformed me due to years of practice...but I still did not feel like it was TRULY taxing or even gratifying to me. What ended up happening was my legs began giving out before  my heart got a chance to really be worked. I must've stopped the bike over 15  times throughout our 3 hour ride...not because my heart was racing, but because of lactic acid buildup in my legs.

The NEXT week, my neighbors asked me to join them in a BRUTAL game of basketball. I remember being so engaged and into the game, that time flew by. (4 hours to be exact.) We ran up and down the court non-stop. I was DRIPPING wet and felt like THAT was the best cardio I had ever gotten. It just seems SO much more engaging and interesting than riding a bike, which appears dull and left me EAGER to drag my bike back home.

I used to play basketball before I got into bodybuilding and was EXCEPTIONAL at it. Obviously people have their own preferences, but I am curious if any one else feels like bike riding is overrated and insufficient to other forms of cardio like swimming or basketball.
(You are also still sitting on a seat the entire time of the ride. You're technically on a machine, transferring pressure to two wheels.)",OppositionMemorialCe,self.Exercise,1587229227

Exercise,My alarm went off at 3:55 this morning...,"I looked at it a bit confused because I couldn’t remember why I needed into be awake at such an absurd hour. Ah... I was gonna go run... 

Before the world came to a skidding halt I was a very average crossfitter but starting to learn how to run because I was tricked into signing up for a half marathon (which has since been rescheduled). I’m 6’1” and weighed 235 on January 21. I was 208 this morning. 

Well, since the gym is closed I can focus a little more on running. So I’ve been rocking about 15-22 miles a week here lately including an easy 7 miles yesterday morning. 

So I got out of bed. Walked around a bit. Then got back in bed. But I couldn’t escape the thoughts of why I was skipping the run. Didn’t really have a good excuse. Had plenty time before work. Weather was ok. My body felt ok. “But I’m comfortable” was the resounding mantra in my head... no one ever got better by being comfortable.. I got up. Clock read 4:06am. 

Didn’t have much of a plan. Maybe 6-7 miles. As I got closer to 6, I decided to go to 10. As I got closer to the 5 mile mark, I decided to stretch it to a half marathon. 

The return home was rough. Wind gusts to 15-20MPH. It was bad. But I PRd my 1/2 marathon at 1:52.35. 8:34/mile. Got home. Showered. Changed clothes. Headed to work. 

Prior to this Covid craziness, there’s no way I could’ve done that. Persistence is key. 

TL;DR went for a run before work. Ended up being a PR half marathon.",imahntr,self.Exercise,1587160928

Exercise,Trouble Engaging Core - Need Help,"I've played high intensity sports (basketball &amp; volleyball) for about 4-5 years and have continuously exercised despite being in quarantine (mainly working on cardio). I am pretty strong especially in my legs. Since my lower body is so strong, I've started noticing that I wasn't getting the full benefit of my core exercises as I wasn't engaging my core properly. For example, my hip flexors were taking off a lot of the weight when I was doing sit ups, I felt a lot of pain in my shoulders and legs when doing planks rather than feeling soreness in my core. I can do eighty sit ups easily and several sit ups in a minute, but I don't feel like I am engaging my core properly. I always say I enjoy core exercises more than cardio because they seem to be easier... I never feel a good sore or feel successful after a core workout. I have spent the last 1-2 hours tonight reading exercise blogs and watching youtube videos on how to ""engage your core properly"", yet I don't feel the least bit tired... (except being annoyed of doing this without success). My core doesn't feel used, I have tension in my back, and my shoulders and neck hurt from the planks. (I wasn't going crazy trying to push myself, but definitely trying!) When I try to engage my core, I also have trouble controlling my breath. (I would try to find a trainer in the future, but unfortunately with the virus going on... that won't happen anytime soon, so I would like to try to learn myself if possible). 

Hopefully someone understands what I am going through and maybe knows a solution or tip to help my problem. 

Anything will help!

Thank you!",Jawsy_,self.Exercise,1587100973

Exercise,Calf pain after running?,"Calf pain after running

In February, I began running to try and get back in shape. I started running on the treadmill and slowly worked my way up to two miles. In the beginning, I had severe shin splints due to poor form and bad shoes. I was able to push through them and now my shin splints have gone away. Recently I’ve gotten new running shoes and have been running outside due to COVID. However, I’ve been experiencing deep calf pain after my runs. They don’t really hurt during my runs, maybe a dull ache, but it’s more prominent after my runs. Even on days when I don’t run, if I ever squat or kneel down for more than a second, my calves begin to hurt and almost cramp up, making it difficult to flex or point my toe. Any ideas what this is due to and how I can’t fix it? Thanks!",TheTroop11,self.Exercise,1587087118

Exercise,Free 4 Week Home Exercise Program,"Hey everyone,

I hope you're doing well and staying healthy during these crazy times.

I'm a physical therapist assistant, strength and conditioning coach and personal trainer. I've been out of work for a while now and haven't had a gym in over a month, so I decided to make a home exercise program where all you need is a backpack, some books, and a chair/coffee table.

In my opinion, everyone needs access to some sort of workout program right now. My goal with this is to give people structure and give them something that'll clear their mind, get outside, and stay healthy. I know I am using this time to get good at all the stuff I typically neglected in the gym like sprints.

Program Overview

* The program is 4 weeks long and 6 workouts per week.
* There are 3 strength days and 3 conditioning days.
* You'll get out what you put in with this program.
* Workouts consist of:
   * Plyometrics
   * Hill Sprints
   * Two ""pump"" days (hypertrophy/strength)
   * Three conditioning challenge days

There's a lot of spots where you could coast through but if you hover around 70%-80% of your max effort, you're going to see changes in weight loss, strength and performance.  
Below is the link to the program. It contains my newsletter sign up if you're interested in posture, fitness, and health info.

[Free Home Exercise Program](https://mailchi.mp/378371745df9/3755tulero)

I am doing a paid version that has a bunch of cool community features, progress tracking, and direct messaging to me all in an app. Below is a link if you're interested in that. I promise it's the same program more organized than a google sheet. Here's a video of the features:

[Video Overview of App Versions](https://youtu.be/Wai7tNVJV20)

Exercise,Need a training plan. I’m 17 y.o 189cm in height and 87kg weight (6′ 2″ and 191lb),"
Hello, this is my third post on reddit and first one About my physique. Let me Explain:

I’m from a hilly region where nearest city is 35km away from me. I used to go to school there, and after school i used to go to gym. Classic Hypertrophy/strenght training for 45 - 60 mins and then go home (i did it for a year effectively). Unfortunately, the quarantine came and i haven’t got that opportunity anymore. But i have a new opportunity to switch from dumbells to gym mat. I don’t want to look big, just strenghten my body. What i started to do is:

25x2 push ups (close, wide), 25 rock climber (each leg) before bed. Everyday i hike to a nearby Hill for an hour and that’s it.

If you guys can give me any advice, or a plan which you have practised for quite a long time, or maybe short term with results (i know i have to be consistent), i would be really grateful :). Maybe like a workout with continous progression (for example 1st day 25 push ups in one go and then challenge yourself with 30) or just a solid routine after i wake up or before bed doesnt matter, im a new to this workout since i’ve Been doing PPL for so long.

If you have any questions About details which might help you with suggestions, ask me!",kowykod,self.Exercise,1587042723

Exercise,Abdominal muscles vs belly fat myth.,"I’ve heard many times, as I assume most people have, that building core strength helps reduce belly fat. I’ve also heard that no, it doesn’t, it simply increases the strength of the muscle underneath the fat. The fat still has to go, through other exercise for the muscles to be visible.

For the sake of finally putting this to bed, what is the fact of the matter? Core exercises are obviously good for you, the same way all exercises are, but should they be dominant in a routine to burn belly fat?",Delnilas,self.Exercise,1586986427

Now, when i feel my torso i can feel the abs but there’s no visible change. And my legs are getting thicker and thicker. I can see and feel the muscle buildup but the fat is also still there. And I just regret even starting to work out lol. I need some advice. How do I get rid of the fat? I don’t really want to build up too much muscle. Basically I want lean legs and I don’t know where to start. I tried to start but now I just regret it.

Exercise,I need to lose weight and get fit... But without too much equipment.,"I'm obese, i want to do something about it, but i dont have much money for equipment... I have a 1 kg and a 12 kg kettlebell, and that's all i have. Though i might be able to get a cheap set of dumbells or something.
I am working on making some room in my apartment to have enough space to exercise.


The biggest problem i have is that im completely out of shape, especially my arm and back strength, i can do maybe 2-3 push-ups. (I can lift 20 kg with little effort) On the other hand i can walk for 4 hours at 7km/h without a break or cycle 10 km at around 25km/h. In short my legs aren't the problem. But with the quarantaine... Exercising by cycling/walking is limited. (Which was most of my movement)

I'm not planning to look like a bodybuilder, i'm already a big guy to start with, but i should get in shape, i was thinking of focusing on my mobility and flexibility with strength as added goal.

Since starting moving is the first step, and mobility and flexibility a prime goal i was thinking of starting with yoga to build habits and routinely move, then gradually add a variety of strength exercises.

Would this work? And what strength exercises would be easiest to start strenghtening my back?",Aeonir,self.Exercise,1586736488

Exercise,Hey r/Exercise I'm tryna get Fit! (Sorry for the long post),"Hey Guys, I'm Pudj and I'm pretty new to working out, since quarantine I've decided to get my life on track while i work from home, I'm currently 19, I work out mildly once a day but wanna push that up, I weight 75KG and have 19% Body Fat. I was wondering if I could get some advice, sorry its such a long post. 

RN my average day looks like this:

8:30-9: Wake Up

9:30: Have a Protein Shake and do 3 sets of Stretches,

10: Have Breakfast,

10-1: Work etc.

1: Have a Protein Shake, stretch and workout, then have lunch,

2-7: Work etc.

7: Have Dinner.

8: Have a Protein Shake, stretch and Second Workout (I haven't been doing this but I'm going to start now).

11: Shower and Get to Bed.

The images I've attached are my stretches i do, as i mentioned i do 3 sets in the morning but only 1 set before workouts, I've attached two workout plans, I previously was only doing body weights, but i have managed to get 2x 8KG dumbells and have adjusted my plan accordingly.

I'm trying to get fit and healthier! My aim is to get bigger biceps, shoulders and more defined abs! I Know this could take anywhere to 5 months. But i really wanna meat this goal, I've also added my current nutrition diet, its roughly 40% Carbs, 30% Fats, 30% Protein, 600 of my daily calories come from protein shakes, and i take creatine supplements, i also drink 2-3 liters of water a day.

So here's the big questions r/Exercise:

Do you guys think this workout schedule (with weights) working out twice a day is okay?

Is my Diet okay?

Can I build muscle by lifting these two 8KG weights? sadly its all i have.

And how long If i stuck to this do you think till i see results?

I’ve been walking a lot but I’m losing some muscle mass now. 

I’d like to keep my legs/thighs &amp; butt toned but I’m having trouble coming up with anything that won’t aggravate it. I loved my squats and now they’re just a nightmare. I can’t expect you to know how my condition feels but I can just look over your ideas and see if they hurt or not.

I'm looking to lose some of the fat I've gained over the past 2 years due to lack of exercise as well as some side effects of my medications for depression, anxiety, and mood stability issues. I also would like to strengthen my arms and shoulders as I've always been a wimpy guy (though my legs and back are relatively strong).

What are some exercises or exercise routines that I could do to achieve these things?

Exercise,Best Quarantine Dumbbell workout ONLY at home,"-Insert obligatory apology in case of duplicate thread of another post already-
25M here. Have had experience working out over the years with personal trainers. I have an adjustable weight bench and a set of dumbbells from 5lbs - 25 lbs. Skinny slim 5’8 150 lbs.
My biggest issue with fitness is consistency. I’m consistent with a diet and doing cardio 4 days a week. However, when i’m not with a personal trainer that gives me guidance, I always lose my discipline to workout. Ultimately my goal is to be toned ( arms, chest, back, legs ((i do want a big booty so if you guys have tips for that that’s be great)) and abs (( which i know a lot has to do with diet which i mostly have down).
The thing is, I have bad anxiety when I look up different workout routines ( there’s countless ) and i get immediately discouraged because i feel very overwhelmed. especially when i look at the comments supposedly ‘debunking’ routines. So I am coming to the only community I trust, the reddit community. I know with the weight of dumbbells it is not good for gaining a lot of muscle mass that’s why mainly I just want to tone (with the exception of my butt, i want a big butt). If someone could please give me a comprehensible dummbells only workout for 5- 6 days out the week i would immensely appreciate it. Or if possible link me directly to one that would be great. I am good with form and positioning since i have had experience in the past. Preferably if something could be split into upper body and then lower body on alternating days. I would appreciate it 😊 Thank you so much !!",ct8624,self.Exercise,1586375886

Exercise,Airdyne bikes,"I have used the assault classic airbike in the past at my gym. I'm not a crossfitter but I worked with a trainer and part of my routine was doing HIIT. 
In addition to that I would also do low-moderate intensity cardio on the bike for 25mins. 
I'm considering buying one for my home. I looked at the classic but also looking at the airdyne AD7 by Schwinn which is belt driven. The assault is currently $699 plus tax. The Schwinn is $899 plus tax. 

Can anyone with experience with both comment on the difficulty level of the Schwinn compared to the assault. I didn't have trouble with the assault for riding it for 1/2 hour. My only consideration to getting a Schwinn is that the belt driven ones are supposedly low to no maintenance and more durable vs the assault being a chain drive. I also like some of the other features of the Schwinn and the smaller footprint but would be ok with the assault if the Schwinn is near impossible to ride for 30mins. (PS - I did consider the concept 2 bike but there's a backorder for months on that and with the quarintine no idea when they'd be shipping).

Exercise,"For those who were inactive before becoming more focused on fitness/exercise , what motivated you and helped you change your lifestyle and stick with it?","I am currently trying to change my lifestyle towards a more healthy one. I am a 27 year old female and I have never been very active or athletic. I hated sports growing up and was one of those girls who hated phys. ed in school (mostly because of how competitive some girls would be). Anyway, this pandemic has really made me realize how inactive I am and I have noticed how lethargic I am for my age. I suffer from anxiety (mild to medium) and could definitely be overall healthier. Most of my life I have been under weight because of my high metabolism, but that has definitely changed over the last few years. Right now I am around 130 pounds and 163 cm tall.

I have never been someone who liked the gym - quite honestly I have always been intimidated because I have no idea how to use any of the equipment. I have gone to yoga studios, but where I live, it is out of the way for me to go (plus they are all closed right now). Since I have been stuck at home, I have started doing 20 minute yoga sessions each day using the Peloton app and have enjoyed it and noticed an increase in energy and my mood. I discussed it with my partner and we have ordered a Peloton bike. I have researched it a lot and thought it would be a good fit for me. I like the community of it and I like how accessible it is, especially once I get back to work. I know that I will never go to a gym after work, but I will be more motivated to hop on a bike when its at home.

Anyway, I am trying to continue pursuing a more active lifestyle. I am not seeking to be a certain weight or to look a certain way either. I just want to have more energy and feel better/healthier. Also, if this helps with my anxiety, it would be a bonus.

I just want to make sure I stick with this lifestyle long term. I'm interested in learning how to stay motivated long term and to stick with this active lifestyle. I would love to hear about other peoples journeys to help motivate me and not feel alone.

Now I have lost 20 lbs and run in VR first thing every morning. But it's a subpar experience. My running speed does not dictate my aerial speed. A tailor made VR app designed to work with the treadmill would be far more immersive.

I want an immersive VR exercise bike where your pedaling and tilting actually controls where you travel to in virtual environments.

Anyway, I try to walk at least 2-3 miles a day but I’d like to do exercises to target my core/build strength. The issue is a lot of exercises like planks or reverse crunches in ab routines...I can’t do right now...for obvious reasons.

Are there any effective exercises for abs that don’t involve bending your knees or utilizing your legs? Especially for upper abs because my upper abdomen is pretty much flat. I just want to see more muscle definition in it.

Exercise,Excercise with myopia (nearsightedness),"Hi! I am 24, extremly nearsighted and way too out of shape for my own health. I have been wanting to do more excercise and maybe strenght my core and my arms. 
Nevertheless, my optometrist has always told me that due to my severe eye condition I should not force my body (no cross Fit, no weights, nothing that involves boxing that could Create head trauma) since that could make my condition worst. 
He cleared yoga and I do that, but I have not seen a real impact with it. I would like to try other disciplines but just googling ""myopia friendly exercises"" has not helped so far and my optometrist does not know enough about excercise either to help me with this, he Just knows The DONTS. 

Any friends with myopia out there have faced this issue? Have somebody helped someone with severe myopia train? 

I feel it is such an specific issue that there is not enough information available and ive been wanting to do some research on my own to then check it with my optometrist if it is safe for me. So I would like to know if any of you have faced this issue or hace any recommendation I should look into.

So, I have a (currently undiagnosed) condition that causes me to pass out at random and my blood pressure resides on the fairly low side of normal, as in I'm just within the parameters of normal, and so because of this is highly stressful situations and it appears somewhat intense exercise I feel very lightheaded or pass out all together. 

Over the past maybe 10 years I've sloooooowly been putting on weight and its finally at a point where I'm wondering how I got here and want to make changes for the  better. I'd love to lose some weight and then do strength training but due to the lightheadedness (and lets face it, lack of real exercise for a few years) I tap out before I feel an impact has been made and it brings me down even further.

I'm reaching out for some help from you guys as I'm clueless and I know its hard without a diagnosis but I need a starting point to change the rest of my life for the better. This is the last year I want this to be an issue. Any help/advice is GREATLY appreciated. Thank you peeps!

But the thing I find weird is that even though I can go to 20, I still feel stiff/shaky at even number 5 or something? But I can still keep going???? I understand muscular endurance and that bodyweight/high reps is what I'm training with, but how do I get the shakiness to go away? I definitely do stretch, warm up, and have good form. So WHAT I'M THINKING (and asking because im not sure) is do I need to start working my chest/arm/shoulder muscles with higher weight in addition to the endurance aspect of doing push ups?

i have chicken breast once a day almost every day.

Exercise,Fever after running? Help!," 

Hello everyone,

I'm new here. I'm just curious if there is a way to avoid fever after exercising? Okay - my story is, I've been sedentary for much of my life, save for some physical education classes about 15 years ago.. but for the most part I am in front of TV and computer. Now about two months back I realised I have to be more healthy by exercising. I ran for about 2 kms but the next day I got fever.

I didn't think it was strenuous at all, after all, I covered the 2-km run in about 45 minutes, having it at my comfortable pace. After that, I stopped exercising, but thinking of resuming once this covid issue is over.

What do you think? Did I do anything wrong? I had regular doctor check-ups and they say my health is okay (no diabetes, hypertension or anything). Oh I also warmed up before it by walking for 15 minutes. I was also well hydrated I believe.

Reason also I am quite serious about this is I want to join a dragon boat team some time this summer, but if running makes me sick I am worried something more will make me more sick.

Any suggestions?",redditorz1234,self.Exercise,1585883253

Exercise,ATHLEAN-X 6 pack promise app actually works.. but with a catch. (in-depth review) + Transformation,"So around 7 weeks ago I downloaded the ATHLEAN-X 6 pack promise app out of hearing about it on his channel.

For the first week it is free but after that it becomes paid (one time purchase of around £2.00). The first week was good and gave me a good burn with equipment that I had so I bought the full version.

By about week 3 the app started requiring physio balls and resistance bands, which I didnt have, nor do many other average people. Side note: it also introduced a bar which I used my stairs bannisters for.

Though I lacked the equipment I still pushed through the weeks, substituting the exercises that I was unable to do when it required a piece of equipment I dudnt have. I started seeing results around week 5-6 but in my final week, 7, my abs finally started to 'pop'. Side note again: the app has 8 weeks to go through but week 8 requires equipment for almost every exercise so I have now moved onto the shuffle feature.

The aforementioned shuffle feature is an amazing part of the app that I sadly neglected until today, it let's you choose what equipment you have at hand and let's you 'shuffle' between randomonised workouts at your selected level.

Another thing to add is that throughout my use of this app i paired it with a calorie deficit (200-500 deficit) and actively working out (resistance training).

Exercise,My PDF version of a workout we did in the military - without gym access!,"Hey folks - Just joined the r/Exercise community as I'm keen to share this workout which I think could be super-useful for everyone stuck at home.

I had a lot of DMs asking for this PDF after mentioning in another fitness community. Hence this post - sharing to try and help people out.

**Background/Context:**

A couple of months ago I decided to start creating some content to capture the lessons and tips I picked up in the military, around safety and fitness. Since then I've been writing short posts and publishing them to my new site.

I mentioned yesterday in a comment that I have put together a PDF capturing a workout we used to do in the military. It was designed for use on Ops in confined spaces and I have done this workout in the desert, on ships, in compounds, and at home. It's a really good workout for the whole body and needs no equipment. The workout takes you through 10 weeks of progression, but you'll see you can extend it indefinitely by increasing reps.

When I made this PDF (the process took me a full week from start to finish), I thought I would charge for downloads to make a little extra money. However, considering how 2020 is going, I want to help people out and so it's totally free to download, now and forever.

To download it, you will need to enter your email address. Someone said yesterday that this was 'sketchy', but this just adds you to my shortlist of people who might be interested in similar workouts in the future. I'm not spamming, selling details or anything like that. I reckon that's fair enough for a full PDF workout guide?

**Bottom line:**

I wrote a short post on this workout here, where you can also download the PDF:

[https://fitforeverywhere.com/bodyweight-workout-plan/](https://fitforeverywhere.com/bodyweight-workout-plan/)

Exercise,Is the heart rate syncing with the tempo of the music true or is it just a myth?,"So when I researched about music during cardio and its effect, this is what I found in several articles:

&gt;If you listen to music at a certain tempo while running, your heart will sync up with the tempo. So if the tempo of the music is 120 BPM, so is your heart rate.

Okay, so if I listen to the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth while running, my heart rate should be 160 BPM because that's the tempo of the music right? Here is what has actually happened:

    Movement: First Theme, Second Theme, Development, First Theme, Second Theme, Coda
    Tempo: 160
    HR:       85           70            85-140       120          90            110

Nowhere did my heart rate ever reach the 160 BPM of the music. And in fact, it got lower than my standing heart rate. Now according to those articles, that isn't supposed to happen. This made me be skeptical of those articles and think ""Well it's just a myth. Heart rate and tempo are unrelated no matter what.""

I tested it again today but with slower music and guess what happened? My heart rate synced up with the tempo. Tempo was about 140 BPM and so was my heart rate. Now I'm more confused. Is there simply an upper limit to the tempo that your heart can sync up to? Does the heart rate already have to be elevated above 100 BPM before the tempo has a significant effect? Or is the heart rate and tempo syncing up just coincidental and thus the articles stating a myth? I definitely think that if the heart truly does sync up with the tempo that it has an upper limit of at least 160 BPM before the tempo has no effect.",caters1,self.Exercise,1585788090

Exercise,"Some advice, fact-checking, and maybe consolation very much wanted.","In May of 2018, I was 18 years old, 5 feet 9 inches, and 229 pounds.

Now, in April of 2020, I am 20 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall, and approximately 172-175 pounds.

I’ve been using an app called MyFitnessPal for dieting and it’s worked well for me. Minimal exercise, just diet. In recent months, I’ve been running a total per-day calorie intake of 1,500-1,800 calories.

However, things are changing. I want to start shifting into more exercise and translate my weight loss into actual fitness and better health.
I have a friend who has a degree in fitness and nutrition and he’s been giving me advice.

While I trust him... you know the old adage, “trust, but verify.”. In addition to the exercise, he’s having me eat at least 2,000 calories per-day. 

Also, as I have lingering belly fat I want gone, he’s recommended more fat in my diet, especially monounsaturated and other healthy fats. He explained that my body is likely clinging to that fat because I don’t give it enough in my diet. Give it a more steady supply, it will let go of what it’s storing.

These are the exercises he currently has me doing:

Monday: Full body stretches. Burpees, mountain climbers, Hindu-pushups, back bridges. Do them in that order and repeat until incapable.

Tuesday: Full body stretches, no other exercise.

Wednesday: Full body stretches. Hindu squats, grasshoppers, sumo squats, lunges. Do them in that order and repeat until incapable.

Thursday: Full body stretches, no other exercises.

Friday: Full body stretches. Prison cell pushups, plank rotations, walking pushups, tricep dips on the floor. Do them in that order and repeat until incapable.

Saturday/Sunday: Full body stretches, no other exercise.

Exercise,Leg pain while walking,"Looking for some advice.

Some background: I'm not a fit guy, but I'm not hugely overweight. I'm 39, 5ft 11"", and 215 pounds. I've never been active - don't work out and don't play sports. I used to walk a bit but haven't in the last 5 / 6 years. Decided at start of March to do something and have started back walking again every day, with the aim of working up to jogging.

I'm doing a 5km walk most days of the week now, but I'm getting this pain in my lower right leg that I didn't get when i walked years ago. Its like a muscle pain from my knee to my ankle, concentrated along the outside of the leg. It starts off as a dull ache after about 1.5 kilometres. By 2km its definitely uncomfortable. It doesn't stop me walking and I can finish the 5km, but by the end it is like my calf's on fire. 

If I walk a bit heavier on my left foot, like I have a limp on the right, I can feel it takes some pressure off and the pain eases. And when I'm back home and finished walking the pain is gone completely almost straight away, it doesn't linger. 

I've tried 3 different pairs of runners / walking shoes, but there's no difference. I thought two or three weeks ago that it was just because I was so out of practice my muscles in the leg aren't used to the exercise. But I'd thought after a month there would be an improvement.

Anyone any idea what this could be and any advice on how I can manager / prevent / treat it?",Branoic,self.Exercise,1585693682
Exercise,Forearm pain/fatigue,"Hi all,

I was decommissioned last year for about 8-9 months because I had tennis elbow and golfers elbow— probably from overworking via pull ups, push ups etc. and continuing on for months despite pain. 

I’ve recently started back up with the push ups and pull ups and feel the beginnings of the issues coming back. I don’t have this problem when I’m just weight lifting, maybe because of rep count? 

Any ideas on how what I can do to prevent this from getting worse and happening again? (Obviously rest, stop the pull ups etc for now but what can I do other than that?)",dontushdahspaghette,self.Exercise,1585688288

Most of my exercise is done on one of those steppers with bands (search brookstones stepper if you're curious) while watching tv. I broke one of the bands so I've been using weights instead.

 I've found a couple standing core exercises online but they're all a bit awkward to do while stepping on the stepper.

Exercise,Do some types of cardio equipment not burn as many calories as others (specifically an elliptical),"Hi, 
Before all this lock down with the coronavirus I was going to Orangetheory 4-5 times weekly and while I’ve lost almost 30lbs I’ve found that I truly enjoy workout. Now, it hasn’t been so easy. I’m at home with both of my boys 2 and 5 and rarely get a moment to think let alone exercise. My SO still works full time M-F 5am - 5pm. I’ve been trying to workout once he gets home, doing 30 mins of HIIT then a 30-45min run. Some days I do not have the time to do this though. 
I have an elliptical, I was lucky enough to get it from a friend who was moving. While I appreciate it and am thankful, it doesn’t seem to do much. I believe, from the looks and quality- and loud squeaky sounds it makes, it’s fairly cheap. When I use it I do not feel like I am getting anywhere close to a good “burn” at all. I don’t nearly feel like I’m burning as many calories as I do from a simple brisk walk. I previously used an elliptical at my gym as well and remember feeling much more sore than I do from this one as well.

Exercise,Advice for exercise with chronic illness,"Hi there.

I've been looking to add a machine to my home to help me stay somewhat in shape. I'm naturally thin but have lost muscle tone over the two years due to chronic illness. I suffer from IBS-C, GERD, panic and anxiety disorder, as well as fibromyalgia. As you can imagine, at lot of exercise causes issues for me. About 2 years ago I started struggling with pelvic floor disorder brought on by the IBS-C. Yay. During this time I lost most of my muscle tone due to depression and inability to move much without constant pain and burning. I do see a physical therapist for that issues (currently postponing appointments due to COVID -19 but do not have an active flare).

I enjoy yoga and it typically seems to be pretty friendly to my body. I have a difficult time staying motivated with it. But anyway. I would like to add some light cardio just for some extra movement and burn a few calories.

The issue is... aerobic exercise often triggers panic attacks. Or at least makes me feel like I'm about to have a panic attack. Most of the effects of aerobic exercise mimic my symptoms of a panic attack. 

So I'm looking for suggestions for some type of exercise I can do in my home. I have a treadmill, but feel guilty using it because I have two large active dogs that could use a walk outside instead. They are walked and hike regularly, even in inclimate weather. I do my best to ensure that my health doesn't prevent their needs from being met. I also have a squat machine. I have a mini trampoline but that usually bothers my stomach (IBS &amp; GERD). 

I was wondering if a recumbent bike would be beneficial? I would imagine that it wouldn't be jarring on my stomach and would be low impact for the fibromyalgia. And I could likely take it slow if I'm having issues with the anxiety triggers. It could potentially be comfortable enough to use it for an hour or so at a slower speed to accommodate whatever conditions of the day? It wouldn't be high intensity but some movement has to be better than nothing?

I'm open to suggestions and questions! I'm thinking recumbent bike, but maybe I'm overlooking something.

Exercise,(venting) I'm truly saddened by the lack of effort my tennis team is giving," (I'm sorry if I'm rambling)

So I coach high school and obviously we aren't able to play currently. This quarantine situation is new to me, so I've been trying to set things up with the team over things like zoom. I made a group call where I had myself kind of leading a quick 10-12 mini cardio workout. Some of these players are jv and haven't exercised much at all, so have to start slow of course. It was an experiment to get this going/complicated. We somehow got it to work and got 5-6 people, which out of...55 isn't exactly the best.

I recently made a new video that was to preimere at 2pm today. With the school's app we can see who actually looked at the accouterments (which is a great feature). I had 46 of the 55 see the message. So I know these 46 read it because it was a two sentence thing. So wasn't something that took a long time to read or was complicated. I had the link in the message, so literally just had to click that button and you were there. I did this so we could all ""technically"" be working out together because it would preimere at the same time for everyone.

I had one message me back that she couldn't do it at time but can do it later today. She was in that first 5-6 group so I believe her on this.

I will also have to say, sure highschoolers are going to be lazy in nature, but this weird quarantine situation. Where there's nothing to do and no where to go, that there really isn't an excuse to do a quick workout.

2....2 F-CKING people, out of the 46 people watched it along with me (can see on bottom of the video when doing preimere videos like this) and I assume did it as well.

This includes varsity, which I will say is pitiful for them to not try and lead the way and do something like this.

This means that 44 of these people looked at their phone and said ""nope, I'm too busy doing nothing to do that.""

There really isn't any excuse for not doing this tape, none. No homework excuse, no chore excuse, no friends house excuse. Unless they were in the hospital I can't think of an excuse. 

I don't why I'm somewhat emotional about this (not crying in the corner, but it kind of a disappointment). I just don't know how to think about this situation on that I'm going to have a team that is going to be like this. 

If we even have a tennis season, I'm going to have to look at this 50+ people (varsity and JV) and try to not have this situation in the back of my mind and judge them.

No excuse that they did this. I know the main coach is going to say ""Oh, you know they're kids, that's just how it is."" Having this mindset means that it is acceptable, if not expected, for students to do nothing. I could blame the parents, but I also can't because these messages only go out to the team and not the parents. It would of been interesting on the numbers if the parents were informed on this too.

Once again this whole quarantine situation is new territory and don't know how this affects students/people in general mentality. I don't want to give up on these people, but I don't want to seem like a dork in the corner who's words are meaningless to others.

Thank you for taking the time just to read this through. I hope everyone is doing ok out there,

Exercise,Cardio Exercises w/ Impossible Restrictions &amp; Going Cold Turkey on Cardio,"I've already done research on this and asked my personal trainer yet no exercise seems to quite fit me, so I'll ask. I'm in desperate need of ways to do quiet, hard-core, equipment-free, indoors cardio in a semi-limited space! I know these are impossible restrictions on cardio exercises, but the thing is that:

1. I live in a country where all gyms are closed and outdoor activities are out of the question as the ground will be covered in snow for coming weeks/months.
2. ALL exercise equipment is unsurprisingly sold out; I only have some light dumbbells. On top of that I live in an apartment with nagging downstairs neighbours, so I'd have to either be quiet or resort to the shared garage space with is very limited.
3. I'm fairly athletic so stuff like mountain climbers, jumping jacks, skipping, e.t.c. don't really do much for me.

This is extremely hard for me as I'm used to exercising twice a day everyday, a leftover vice from an ED I'm recovering from and although I'd planned of trapping my exercise down, going from exercising twice a day to no exercise is impossible; I cannot afford the loss of dopamine on top of my major depression that was already dangerous enough before this happened.

It's been a week and I'm doing so poorly to cope that I'm starting to think that I won't be alive once (if) this all blows over. Does anyone feel similarly and have ways to cope with this in a ""healthy"" way?",mrvordloldemort,self.Exercise,1585588412

So far I feel like it’s been working for me pretty well. (Also sorry for the weird format, I’m on mobile lmao)

1st set:

•8 push-ups

•8 Squats

•8 ab rolls (ab roll wheel)


2nd set:

•9 Push-ups

•9 squats

•25 second hollow hold

•9 ab rolls


3rd set:

•10 push-ups

•10 squats

•30 second hollow hold

•10 ab rolls

And then after the third set it goes back down, similar to the pyramid workout. So after doing 10 push-ups, you do 9 on the next set and then after that set you do 8 and that’s pretty much the whole workout. Lmk what you guys think and/or if there’s anything you think I should change.

I am 27/F/5ft5/~230lbs. I must lose weight and it must be this year I reduce to at least 170lbs. 

So today I did 10 mins cross trainer, 3x12 abs work, 3x12 arm work and 3x12 squats. I was sweating. ~30 minutes. My knees hurt and it was my first time doing this. I tried not to look in the mirror because I didn’t want to feel discouraged by the journey ahead. I look like an inverted triangle (mostly due to being so busty) but my body composition is fairly good.

Anyway, I ended up napping for 1.5 hours because I was shattered. I’ve done harder exercises before but this simple exercise really knocked me out. Is it normal? How do I keep myself motivated when I know it may take awhile to get my dream body?",helloitsrainbow,self.Exercise,1585423555

Exercise,Injury/workout ideas,"I have been dealing with a very chronic hip injury for the past 2 years. I’ve gotten 2 MRIs, many many xrays, and a CT bone scan and after many minsdiagnosises we think it’s an avulsion fracture of my ischial tuberosity perhaps combined with a bone bruising. I’ve done PT and gotten a cortisone injection but nothing has helped at all. 
It is very painful to sit, do exercises with my legs, run, and especially bend down to pick things up. 
For the first year I just tried to modify my crossfit workouts and only use arms/do things that didn’t hurt but then I developed what seems to be really bad elbow tendinitis. 

So for the past year I’ve just been swimming 6-7x per week which has been amazing. I have never left the pool in more pain than I started and it still feels like I get a good workout. 
BUT now since the corona closures, I do not have access to a pool and cannot swim and not working out has been making me feel so anxious and like a piece of shit especially because my mom does 2 crossfit workout every day and runs 20 miles a week 😞 

I know this is a SUPER long shot haha because I feel like I’ve tried every exercise in the book but I’m desperate so does anyone have any workout ideas that wouldn’t bother my elbow or hip? Or has anyone experienced similar injuries?

So I last consulted this subreddit back in early October, looking for tips on how to lose weight. If by some small chance someone remembers my post, I am happy to say that my persistence combined with eating less, and tips from Reddit helped me go from 212 pounds down to 183 pounds. So thank you anyone who gave me tips.

I took a break from daily exercise for a while, due to other life commitments taking priority. However, due to everything being postponed because of the Covid-19 outbreak, I am now stuck at home. With little else to do, I’ve decided to continue improving my physical health. A5the moment, I’m in the process of trying to convert my remaining flabs of fat into muscle, and strip away what I don’t need. So any tips or suggestions would be very appreciated.

Here’s a little information about myself and my situation if that’s helpful. I’m 18 and 6’2. I don’t have access to a gym at the moment, but I do have some weights, a sit up bench, and the ability to run laps down my driveway if needed. 

So if anyone could give me some tips on continuing to burn away my fat and possibly replace it with muscle, that would be great. Thank you reddit, and stay safe in these difficult times.",Greyhound9721,self.Exercise,1585237565

I used to ride a bike everyday for hours on end and i used to practice great hygiene and so much more at my A game. Now I cant.

Exercise,Relatively new to exercising but I no longer have access to my campus gym. I have limited equipment in my home and do not know how to transition to home exercise.," Hey  all, just looking for some advice. I was trying hard to get in shape  prior to coming home from school for spring break. I used my campus' gym  and finally figured out what I should be doing to get in shape. Now  that I am home, though, the whole world has shut down and I will be here  for the foreseeable future. I was wondering if anyone here could help  me to figure out how to keep working towards my goal of getting in  shape.

Just some background on  me... I am tall and skinny. I am trying to mostly gain muscle weight,  but would not mind losing some stomach-area fat. Before starting to  exercise at school for a few weeks leading up to break, I had never  exercised consistently before.

My upper body exercises were: bishop's curl, chest press, triceps pulls, shoulder lifts, chest fly.

My lower body exercises were: leg extension curl, reverse leg curl, hip induction/abduction, squats, calf extensions

I can luckily do the same ab exercises since they did not require any machines unlike the other exercises.

The  only equipment I have at home is a set of 10 pound dumbbells and an  assorted collection of workout extension cords. I know I won't be able  to get the same quality of workout at home with this equipment, but I  really want to keep making progress on all of the muscle groups I was  previously working on.

If anyone  has any ideas for a new routine I can do at home, I would really  appreciate it. Thanks for making it this far and I hope you all stay  safe!

**tl;dr**  : Used to do bishop's curl, chest press, triceps pulls, shoulder lifts,  chest fly, leg extension curl, reverse leg curl, hip  induction/abduction, squats, calf extensions but can't now that we're on  lockdown.

Exercise,Nuclei Overload Training test,"So with Coronavirus causing my country to close all its gym's (UK) I've found myself in the pinch of that my equipment extends as far as 4 resistance bands and 1 18kg dumbell. So I've decided to use the next month to test something that I've always wanted to try being Nuclei Overload Training (Scott Herman Fitness did a video explaining this a lot better than I can in January). Basically by training a muscle everyday for 30 days then taking a sufficient rest period you can make hypotropic gains to a muscle through increasing its nuclei count, increasing its size.


Background:
Formally morbidly obese at 160kg I spent 3 years intermittently lifting, getting serious 1 year ago, and with some generous amounts of cardio I dropped down to a floating weight of between 89-94kg and around 18-22% BF. My main strength feats are a 1Rep Max Bench Press of 125kg and Deadlift of 200kg. My OHP and Squats lack due to shoulder and knee injuries acquired during high school sports. I am currently 19 and will update this post with bicep/arm and chest measurements at the end of the 30 days.


Nutrition:
I usually average 3000-3500 calories a day and 210g of protein, carbs and fats are not tracked but my diet is relatively low on carbs, my only source being oats in my breakfast and then from Rice with my post workout meal. I never touch fast food and my diet operates on a 18:21 split of 18 clean meals and 3 not so clean meals a week. During the process of the overload training I expect I will have to up my calories slightly and carb intake to accommodate. Sleep as well will be consistent 8 hours and water intake at 6L per day. 


Training: 
Traditionally I trained 5 days per week on an U/L split (ULULU) with the weekends as rest days and the Wednesday not focused on heavy lifting but more on form and conditioning. Additionally 3-4x per week I would throw in 20 mins HIIT sessions spaced out 6 hours before/after my weights training.


Nuclei Overload Training:
My plan is to keep my cardio in the plan with a morning run at 6am for 30-45 mins OR 20 mins of HIIT training. And the weights training as follows:
100 Bicep Curls (each arm)
100 tricep extensions (each arm)
100 sit-ups
100 push-ups
And as an addition using my resistance bands to perform shoulder exercises, and ofcourse lower body work ie squats, lunges and bridges, I also plan to use the bands to train my back along with a pull-up bar, however my pull-ups will be spaced away from the rest of the training and will be performed as 3 sets to failure, this is the only time biceps will cross over through exercises. The triceps are also activated in push-ups as I'm aware of, however I plan to use alternative grips/stances to shift as much of the weight to my chest rather than my triceps.",Maximus2k1,self.Exercise,1584833349

Exercise,Limited exercise. Help!,"Swimming is my best high calorie burning and high heartrate exercise so far considering my limitations.

But since this pandemic, a YMCA membership which includes their daycare watching my toddler so I can swim hardcore is not an option for a while.

Until then, I don't know what to do. I have some physical therapy type exercises for my legs (very limited), core (limited to healing diastasis recti), and upper body(limited to deal with c6 c7 congenital fusion symptoms) but that's on hold due to recently diagnosed positional vertigo. So waiting on insurance to approve physical therapy for positional vertigo. 

My main issue regarding cardio and high calorie burning are my legs. Bilateral chronic exertional compartment syndrome all 4 lower leg compartments with failed fasciotomy on all. Functional popliteal artery entrapment syndrome bilateral. Failed surgery of popliteal release. It's pretty far along so it's not like I simply can't run. Biking, kneeling, squats, plantar flexion, jumping Jacks, leg press, walking, standing, etc all ignite it. 

Left hamstrings are super sensitive due to weakness. Isometric exercise seems best on it when it but even then, it's iffy on whether it will get the good soreness or flare up... 

Add my issues elsewhere, I feel very limited. 
I'm severely overweight now since the last few months of my pregnancy in summer 2018. It's been very hard to get weight off. I was 165-170 range before. I thought a way better diet would at least help me lose 5 to 10lbs to make exercise more comfortable. I was 230 at labor.... I'm now 240-250 range. I'm willing to accept that I may have gained muscle and/or water weight since adding back in some short walks (very painful by the way and contraindicated) and short bike rides several times per week. As well as toting an ever growing baby/toddler around in some walks, while out at dr appointments, other outings. As well as getting back into my massage therapy work (2-4hrs per week). But even a little muscle or water weight added (assuming the worst that it isn't added fat) is not good for me right now. I need literally weight and mostly fat to be rid of. 

Hormones tested fine a few weeks ago. Despite some wierd symptoms (enlarged pituitary gland on MRI. Don't worry, no tumor or pushing on structures, lack of breast milk (low breast milk a few weeks in, a few drips/completely gone about about 4 months after birth), my hormone levels tested seem fine. So, considering that, and my diet is intermittent fasting, lowered calories, lowered sugar and carb intake, (70-80% on track), I guess my body is stubborn and wants high intensity exercise it used to be used to? 

I need help please. I need something that helps me burn a lot of calories and get my heart rate up. I'm ok with strength training. But for strength and calorie burning, not bulking up. (Regardless of muscle efficiency growing at the same rate or not, my muscles bulk quick).

Thank you. Really desperate here. Physical therapists are having a hard time coming up with anything hardcore for me to do. But I'm not about to go down to unsustainable low calorie diet levels. I'm willing to tighten up my diet better though!",R0ck01,self.Exercise,1584778057

However, my hives only breakout when I'm warming up and once my workout comes into full swing, it goes away. Does anyone else experience this while working out? Is this related to some sort of allergy?

Exercise,At Home Chest Workout - Reggie Bennett,"The beginning of the week is related to chest training. On Mondays and Tuesdays, with the help of machines. What can we do when we can’t go to the gym and we want to continue training chest? We propose a post with a home chest workout plan. The chest training that we present can be done anywhere without machines, only with the help of our own body weight, and basing the training on plyometric push-ups.

With this type of training, it is not intended to gain muscle mass, it is training based mainly on gaining power from the upper train since all the exercises we propose are performed explosively. These types of exercises are not suitable for beginners, you need good postural control and good muscle tone.

The routine consists of four exercises. It can be done in the form of a circuit resting about 30 seconds between each exercise or perform 3 series of each exercise resting between series and series 3 minutes. These times will vary according to the objective we pursue. For resistance strength work it is preferable to perform the circuit, with about 15 repetitions of each exercise, however, if we want to focus on the power, the second option is advisable, making each series between 6-10 repetitions.

The first exercise consists of performing plyometric push-ups with lateral displacement, an excellent exercise to work also with the lower train coordination. The second exercise is even more intense and more explosive, it consists of performing plyometric push-ups with a slap. For this type of exercise, it is advisable to put a mat on the floor in case there is a fault.

For the third exercise, we propose the push-ups, in which we have to turn the body every time we perform a flex. And to finish the routine, diamond push-ups, in which we put the thumb and index finger of the hands together, making the triceps more participants.

Here are a series of exercises that you can do at home without any material:

Lower Chest Exercises: this exercise is one of the best known, and consists of the typical push-ups that everyone has ever done. If they don’t work out or it costs too much work, they can be done vertically by supporting the arms on the wall or on the kitchen countertop and leaning slightly forward so that the effort is much smoother. Over time it is advisable to learn more and more, leaning on a table, then on the sofa (if it is leaning against a wall), to end up doing them horizontally.

Palms pressure: the palms of the hands must be placed together, with the thumbs attached to the chest, the forearms parallel to the floor and the legs open at the height of the hips. In that position, exert force by pressing one hand against another for a moment.

Scissors arms: standing with your legs open at hip level, your arms should be stretched by placing them parallel to the floor. In this position, make a horizontal scissor movement.

Exercise,Suggestions to do exercise at home?,"Good morning, folks.

I'm from Spain and as you may know, I've been in quarantine for days now and apparently there's still a LOOOOOOOONG way to go. I'm going crazy, I don't know what to do anymore, and the only exercise I could do was walking outside and logically, I can't do that for now. Walking is the only exercise I can do without wanting to die because my knees are pretty weak and there are days where they hurt like hell (I broke both of them in the past... don't ask).

Exercise,Abs disappearing,"I am a relatively skinny 15yo boy who's been working out, especially my abs, for the past few months. I noticed that in the morning after a 30 - 45 min medium-intensity ab workout my abs would be highly defined, however, when I finished my breakfast it would disappear.

I have thought that I would need to eat more protein or exercise a bit more vigorously but no matter what I do, no matter how much I change up my diet no matter how much or how little protein I consume, my progress does not show by the time I finish my breakfast.

I find this quite confusing as all the ab workout websites I visit all say the same thing, and all of which I follow. I also don't believe that is genetics as both my parents' families have sported abs as well as my metabolism not being too high.

I would really appreciate any suggestions as I am really lost for what to do 😟",DarkJizo-_-,self.Exercise,1584434909

Exercise,A young lad in need of advice,"Context: I'm a 19 yo male, throughout my life I've always liked sports, I used to practice Muay Thai, Judo, soccer, rowing, skateboarding, surfing, running and some more stuff, but as time passed I lost interest in any sport with a ball, don't live anywhere near a beach anymore, nor near somewhere I could go skateboarding, my Muay Thai master died and now I live far from the place where I practiced Judo, I tried other dojos, but those places just seem like factories. I like going to the gym but I hate the people around me, it feels so much like a toxic place. The only exercise I regularly do nowadays is biking everywhere I go and some long walks I take, but that doesn't cut it for me, I've been on this routine for 2 years now and honestly, I feel depressed, I miss the exercise, the good chemicals it released in my brain and the good it did to my body.
 I've always kinda ate like an athlete because of the amount of exercise I did and now is hard to stop, so I gained 3 kilos, wich is bad, because I was at my ideal weight. I know it looks like I'm just bitching and finding ways not to exercise, but I truly enjoy exercise, it's just that motivation is everything for me, if I like the ambient, I will gladly wake up at 5am everyday to destroy my body at the gym, but if I don't, one push up a week becomes an insane task.

Exercise,"How to break all of your ""I don't wanna"" excuses, and accommodate your work with healthy lifestyle? How to be a healthy programmer?","# Hello. Thank you for taking your time to read that post. Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker of that language. I've been working as a programmer for 5 years. It is a really nice, stable job, but it has one issue. You have to sit A LOT, that means that you don't move much. Sometimes you even sit (from my experience) up to 14h A DAY. Well, I would like to say that it is a my problem, but a lot of my friends that work in IT have experienced that. According to [simpleprogrammer.com](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) ""The average American actually spends 10 hours a day sitting. And if you ask programmers out there, they probably sit more than 10 hours just because of the nature of our jobs."". It is not hard to guess we experience back pain a lot. I am not even saying about our poor posture. This one problem isn't trivial, because it means other problems. Let's say, that in average we sit for 12 hours ((10+14)/2=12), and sleep, we (that is a sad thing) sleep not much, because we have short deadlines and you have to do your work quickly, let's say that we sleep for 6 hours. It means 24-12-6=6, 6 hours when we can do something other than our job, 6 hours we can do something. There we have another problem, in that short amount of time, we are not able to eat properly. So we eat, sorry for being honest, like a piece of sh*t. We are treating our self like trash bins. Now we know, that we are eating poorly, usually not exercising, and we are not sleeping much. We are usually overweight or skinny. How can we improve our lifestyle? I personally tried to work out twice in my life. After some time I've been saying ""I don't wanna, not today, why would I"" etc. We are sometimes really weak. According to fitness wiki ""[...] It is good to start small"". It is really hard, you can't get OK recovery with that poor sleep. I tried to change time of my sleep, but I just can't sleep. Apparently, my goal isn't to be a sports man, my goal is to be healthy, have some more energy, and be on good level of my strength. It is really hard to accommodate it with our job. Maybe, there is someone on this reddit who experienced the same thing as me and solved it. I probably wouldn't go to gym, to get advice of some experts, because I would be scared that they would have fun from my weakness. Cooking, takes a lot of time, that we don't have. With back pain, you don't have that much motivation to work out, when you feel the pain to do that. You feel that every exercise is too hard for you, that you can't do anything. I would like to improve my self, because it is annoying when you can feel the back pain everyday, when it is hard to climb longer stairs, when you wouldn't go swimming with someone, because you know you will be tired after swimming your first 15 meters, when you can't get straight position, because even that is too hard for you (for a longer time). Every type of help, will be appreciated. Someone who will yell at me, to motivate me, someone who will share their experience, someone who will motivate me, or anyone that will try to help.",karold7,self.Exercise,1584225847

Exercise,Safe back exercises?,"I'm 7 weeks into daily gym/exercise and I'm seeing some nice results so far, if not as much as I would have liked. One area that's becoming increasingly apparent as something I need to work on is my posterior chain.

I was initially avoiding most of the work my research was turning up for this area due to pain (not good pain) in my knees and back. I'm under 30 and have no underlying conditions, I've just spent a good chunk of my life sedentary and probably have muscles that need to be eased into working as they should. I'm finding exercises targeting my upper back are aggravating my shoulders and spine, while exercises targeting my glutes are aggravating my lower back (though in the latter case, as I work the glutes more, this seems to be diminishing - though still an issue).

What can I be doing to protect my back while I work on the posterior chain? What are some exercises that can properly engage and work each area without excess tension? Are there any exercises in particular I should be avoiding in the first few weeks while I build up strength?",Wolfguarde_,self.Exercise,1584197431
Exercise,17 year old looking to be stronger,"I'm 17, weight 120 pounds, 5' 4''

I've been pretty fit for the last 4 or so years, I've mostly focused on getting abs, which I have, but now I want to try getting stronger in my arms, specifically be able to bench 200 pounds. I have 4 weeks basically free because of the coronavirus, and I want to use it to become my best self.

I have very little experience with lifting, normally, I do pushups and lightweight workouts with 10-pound weights. I've already begun keeping track of protein intake, around 70 g not counting dinner (which is normally some form of chicken, not fried)

So, a few questions

1- Is my goal realistic? Should I shoot for a lower weight?

2- How can I get myself to that number?

3- Any specific exercises?

4- Anything else I should know/tips?",DarthCono15,self.Exercise,1584194608

Can You Learn to
   
 Tell The
   
 Future Of a Song?
   
  

In one
   
 hour or so, you can learn how to be a
   
 “prophet” — see
   
 into the future
   
 —
   
 and tell all these things about almost any song:

What’s the

most likely
   
 chord
   
 for the song to start on…

What’s the

most likely
   
 chord
   
 for the song to end on…

What the three

most likely
   
 chords
   
 in any song are…

What the

second chord
   
 in a song will probably be…

What the 4th, 5th, and 6th

most likely
   
 chords
   
 in any song are…

What chord follows a

7th chord
   
 85% of the time…

Why a knowledge of
   
 “consecutive
   
 dominant 7ths”
   
 can revolutionize your understanding of what’s 
   
 happening in any given song…

Why a knowledge of the
   
 “circle
   
 of 4ths”
   
 gives you a huge edge about what chords are coming next…

Dear Friend:

    
   
 Do you have any idea how valuable this knowledge is? Can
   
 you see how it could benefit you right away and give you a
   
 big edge in music? Let’s take an example from another
   
 field:

    
   
 What if you had the ability to predict what the price of a
   
 stock, let’s say IBM, would be tomorrow morning? Would that give
   
 you ad edge in the stock market? Even if you were wrong 15% of
   
 the time, it would only be a matter of months until you were
   
 so rich you wouldn’t be able to spend all the money you made.
   
 Right?

    
   
 Of if you could predict what the price of pork bellies, or
   
 cattle, or soybeans, or corn…or anything — you would soon
   
 own the world and most of the solar system.

    
   
 In music, money isn’t involved directly, but another
   
 kind of riches is — satisfaction, enjoyment, mutual respect of
   
 other musicians, etc., and you have it within your power to
   
 gain the ability to accurately predict — with accuracy ranging
   
 from 60% up to 85% — what will happen next in a song in
   
 terms of chord progressions.

    
   
 Will you ever be wrong? Of course. I still miss now and then.
   
 But you’ll understand the framework of why chords progress the
   
 way they do, so your confidence level will soar.

Wouldn’t it be nice if
   
 you could predict which chord would probably come next
   
 in a song?

    
   
 I’ve got some good news for you.

    
   
 It is
   
 possible.
   
 Not 100%, but
   
 somewhere on the order of 75% to 85% accurate.

    
   
 That’s because music has

FORM
   
 — like the skeleton that holds your flesh, muscles, and
   
 skin up. If you had no bones — no skeleton — your
   
 flesh and all the other parts of you would fall in a
   
 heap on the floor. Not a pretty picture. But because you
   
 DO have a skeleton, you are able to walk around and
   
 pretty accurately predict which way your next step will
   
 take you.

    
   
 It’s the same in music. Music has
   
 FORM
   
 — a skeleton to hold it up, hold it together. And that
   
 skeleton is made out of chords — harmony — the tonal
   
 center of the song or piece.

You Can
   
 Predict Which Chord Comes Next. You Can
   
 Become a “Musical Mindreader”!

    
   
 In any given key you can play in, there are

PRIMARY CHORDS — chords that occur way more
   
 than other chords. They are like family members of that
   
 particular key.

    
   
 At your house, let’s say you have 3 people in your
   
 family — your spouse, your child, and you. On the same
   
 block, but down the street a few houses, lives your
   
 cousin and her family.

    
   
 At any given moment, who are the most likely people to
   
 be in your house?

Obama?

   
   
 Payton Manning?

                              

        
   
 Rush?

                         
   
 Barry Bonds?

I don’t think so!

    
   
 It’s possible, of course, but not too likely. If I had
   
 to guess, I would say it would be either you, your
   
 spouse, or your child. It might be your cousin down the
   
 street – there’s a much better chance of that than, say,
   
 Hillary or George — but my best odds would be to guess
   
 that the family members would be there.

 
   
    It’s the
   
 same way with chords.
   
 In any given key,
   
 there are 3 “family members” that are residents of that
   
 key — the
   
 I
   
 chord, the
   
 IV
   
 chord, and the
   
 V chord.
   
 They are far and away the most likely chords
   
 to occur in any given key.

 

What
   
 chord comes next?

So how
   
 could I tell whether it should be
   
 F
   
 or
   
 G?
   
  

If the
   
 melody is a “B”,
   
 then the chord is probably a
   
 G
   
 chord. Why? Because “B”
   
 is in the
   
 G
   
 chord, but is not in the
   
 F
   
 chord.
   
  

If the
   
 melody is a “A”,
   
 than I would guess that the chord is
   
 F.
   
 Why? Because “A”
   
 is in the
   
 F
   
 chord, but is not in the
   
 G
   
 chord.
   
  

Does that
   
 mean that there are always just 3 chords in a song? No,
   
 but there are literally hundreds of songs that are made
   
 of just 3 chords.
   
  

What if
   
 there are more than 3 chords in a song? What then?

    
   
 That’s what we’ll take up in the course so you’ll
   
 understand it clearly!

 

How will it
   
 help you to become a “musical mindreader”?

You’ll amaze other
   
 musicians &amp; friends who don’t know what you know…
   
  

You will develop more confidence
   
 in your playing as a musician…
   
  

If you play for a
   
 living, there’s a good chance it will increase your
   
 income!
   
  

If you teach piano or
   
 guitar or any instrument, you’ll have a wealth of
   
 knowledge about music that you can share with your
   
 students.

Learn what
   
 chords will occur in any key…
   
  

Learn what
   
 chord to start on — once you know the key of a song…
   
  

Learn what
   
 three chords are the most likely to be used in any song…
   
  

Learn what
   
 chords 7th chords “want” to progress to…
   
  

Learn “the
   
 family of chords” and never wonder who is in each family
   
 again.
   
  

Apply your
   
 new knowledge to any song in any key — major or minor.
   
  

You’ll learn
   
 about the “fam”, the “cousins”, and the “neighbors” —
   
 enough chords to keep you going (and other guessing) for a
   
 long time.
   
  

You’ll also learn all
   
 about the “Circle of 4ths” and how it reveals “family
   
 secrets” of key relationships, chord relationships, chord
   
 progressions, chord substitutions…

     Do
   
 you see the power in this? Once you understand the Circle
   
 of 4ths and how it works, there’s no key that can stump you
   
 — you’ll understand every single key that any song or
   
 piece could be written in. People who know and understand this
   
 circle are at a tremendous advantage over other musicians.

    
   
 I could go on and on, but if you don’t see the power of
   
 becoming a musical mindreader by now, there’s nothing else I
   
 could say that would convince you.

    
   
 And for 39
   
 bucks — the price of a
   
 cheap pair of shoes
   
 — you just can’t go wrong. You have
   
 everything to gain, and nothing
   
 at all to lose.

    
   
 Blessings,

    
   
 Duane

Our son wants to join us, which is wonderful to have another thing to do as a family, however he is 9 and I don't want him doing exercises meant for adults. I will do cardio and my husband may lift weights. Usually our son gets bored and starts to do his own thing like kick the soccer ball around, and he thinks of it as his own little workout.

 I bought 5lb weights for myself to use for arm workouts and our son asks if he can lift them. I tell him no because I don't want him to hurt himself. I was thinking about getting him 2lb weights to lift until he got bored. Are 2lb weights too much to let a 9-year-old lift? Could I get 1lb weights, or should I just let the idea go. Also if he joined a little bit of cardio, is it too much for a kid his size? My husband thinks because of it little bit he will join us its' not enough to hurt him, but we're no exercise experts.",hydrangeasunshine,self.Exercise,1583845764

Exercise,"Cross posted in r/Fitness, need advice","TLDR at end. 

So my dad turns 50 this year. He's been pretty overweight since I can remember. He's not obese or anything (I don't think) but he's got the stereotypical dad belly and he's always complaining about how fat he is. 

5-6 years ago, we were going to the gym together early every weekday, but it wasn't sustainable with my school and work schedule so once I stopped going, he did too. 

I tried to explain calorie deficits to him, and even made him a whole meal plan to make cooking simpler. He just keeps giving me excuses as to why he can't follow a healthier eating plan, saying he's too stressed to think about it. 

I keep asking him to join me at the gym whenever I notice he has free time, but again he doesn't want to. He says he's just going to end up hurting himself there if he doesn't get into a good regimen. 

He also likes to snack. I've tried to get him to stop buying such unhealthy snacks, but he always comes home with cookies and chips and eats them frequently. 

I know he's unhappy with how he looks, but I don't know how to help at this point. I want to help him feel better because I know it'll make him happier, but he keeps giving me excuses. 

What do I do?

TL;DR my dad knows he's fat but is ""too stressed"" to spend time figuring out healthy eating and exercise. How do I help?",bernhardttt,self.Exercise,1583416540

I have had my moments where ill start exercising, but i often end of stopping within a week. currently it looks like and feels like most of my weight is in my belly and thighs. My main goal is to eventually have a lean, chiseled look, but defiantly not appear as bulky (basically have a small and slender shape with well defined muscles.) My main question is, is where do I start? But most importantly, how do I stay **motivated** and not quit after i start? Another thing to mention, I am an over achiever, and while I know its not the most healthy thing to do, I like to start off strong (ie. id rather not start out only doing 15 minutes a day, rather maybe 30 or preferably an hour a day.) But that might be the reason I can't keep up with the plan and end up quitting. Also, what should i eat? I'm definitely not the healthiest eater, the diet plan that intrigues me the most is one called Carb Cycling, Have any of you tried it? if so was it any good/helpful? Anyways, any advice I could get would really be appreciated, and I do understand that the body i'm wanting doesn't happen over night, and that I really need to put as much effort in as I can if I ever want to achieve it (also just a quick note: I am home schooled, and my schedule can change and fluctuate as much as I need.)",Zir0hh,self.Exercise,1583306981

I have had a stiff back and neck ever since I took a bad fall. All MRI’s came back negative, so I know that I don’t have any vertebrae issues, only musculoskeletal.

I went through physical therapy for about 3 months which helped tremendously, but I can’t seem to get back to feeling 100% like I used to be. In addition to this, I always feel lightheaded and like there’s something in my throat now. 

I’m back to working out and running, but I still have some limitations, such as heavy deadlifts and squats.

The back and neck pain now is spontaneous, sometimes in the lower back but almost always in the upper back and neck. I still haven’t been able to shake off the muscle tightness.

An example of this: Every time I wake up in the morning and do a simple stretch like bringing my chin to my chest, I will feel 3ish pops in my upper neck muscles located in the back of my head, near the splenius capitis area 

Any idea why this can be? Any feedback would be appreciated!",VinX1997,self.Exercise,1583197260

Exercise,Workout routine for 15 year old?,"Im a 15 year old boy turning 16 this year and I’d like to look somewhat my age before my birthday. I’ll be honest, these past years have been rough for me. I’ve been tall but hella skinny my whole life. I’m not bone skinny and I’m not underweight for my age, but just to give u an idea, my fingers can touch when wrapped around my wrists. It’s been especially tough dealing with this as I just started High School, and half the other freshmen are bigger than me. If I get into a fight, I’m getting folded not because I can’t fight, but because most kids could probably lift me up and I can’t. 

I’m not really a late bloomer cause I’ve been able to cum for a while now, my voice has deepened and I have facial hair and pubes. But for some reason my body growth hormones just said fuck me and won’t do their job. For the past 5 years I’ve eaten unhealthy junk and fast food for every meal, every day, yet I just don’t gain weight. 

So I guess all I’m asking is, are there any foods that can stimulate/ activate my growth hormones? And what’s a good routine to enlarge the appearance of my arms and chest?",njerome088,self.Exercise,1583185918

Exercise,Careful of Radioactive food you eat when Gaining Muscle or Weight,"A lot of food is slightly radioactive because of uranium pollution and what not. But the amount of radiation is not usually that harmful, but it is still not good. When gaining muscle or bone mass you are introducing new atoms into your body thay it will stay with you for months or years or until you lose weight again. So I would just strongly suggest eating only organic food when you are in a period of rapid weight gain. There are pollutants other than just radiation that are absorbed and incorporated into your body too, so when gaining mass you should just stick to organic food.",RoboticDogeCat,self.Exercise,1583166579

I’ve never been proactive on weight loss so this is all new to me. Am I not doing proper workouts? Or is this a in due time kind of situation where I should be more patient?

Exercise,I was given words of encouragement at the gym that has motivated me to keep going back!,"Last summer I was in a rigorous kickboxing class. I was loving it, bought a bag for home and for the first time in a while, loved exercise. Several weeks into the course, I broke my ankle. It took 12 weeks in a boot and a month of non-weight bearing. Needless to say, the weight I had lost came back. I hit my highest weight at 198 (I'm 5'1"")😔. 

After the boot was gone, I still had pain for several weeks. Around Christmas time I started slowly getting back to exercising. I changed my diet too, and have lost 10 pounds. I bought a membership at my local rec center and went for the first time today. 

I've started using the app couch 2 5k, and I'm ashamed to admit that the first day kicked my butt. After the run, I spent some time on the towers. A woman came up to me who was very fit and said, ""great job in there! Keep it up!""

I was honestly afraid of going to the gym. It is a very vulnerable place for me as I am so ashamed of my weight and how out of shape I am. Her saying that meant everything to me. It was great encouragement to keep going",TheSilentBaker,self.Exercise,1583032941

Exercise,Less calories than needed = no difference?,"  

Pre-tl;dr – can under eating in calories prevent you from seeing and feeling noticeable changes in your body?

Male. Hovering around 235lbs (both then and now)

A while back I started P90X3 (one exercise a day) – I enjoyed doing it and never had any problem with any of the exercises. At the time I had a desk job and was targeting around 2,700 calories a day (but I was probably always well under that due to stubbornness). I probably should have been doing 3,000 but I swayed the numbers in my favor because I wanted rapid weight loss. 

And after 90-days I had my weight loss, but I saw no real results in my body. My strength remained relatively unchanged, reps or didn’t go up or down, stamina was around the same, no definition. Wasn’t able to do anything more than one unassisted pull-up. After everything that was super frustrating. I had a “eat garbage weekend” to celebrate making it 90-days and it sorta just never stopped.

I decided to jump back in the past few weeks and try it again (was also jump started by an unprompted comment from a coworker, “You gettin’ fat”). 

I’ve checked the math that the P90X nutrition guide laid out and it seems that I am going to be targeting 3,000 calories this time around. (Regardless if I pick lose weight, maintain weight, or gain weight for the equation I always end up at 3,000 calories). 

==

The nutrition guide breakdown looked like this  
 1) Gender? +1 for Female, +2 for Male.

2) Weight? &lt;130 +1, 131-160 +2, 161-180 +3, 181-200 +4, 201-220 +6, &gt;221 +6

3) Activity level? Slacker -1, Moderate +0, Hardcore +1

4) Modifier. Lose weight +0, Maintain weight +1, Add weight +2

So for me it was 2+6+0+2 (regardless of which number I pick for ‘modifier’ I remain in the 3,000 calorie range)

[u/Callusedthenics](https://www.reddit.com/user/Callusedthenics/)

After dropping out of the army because he realized that it was too hard and there are only 3 meals per day which are portioned, he decided to come back to mom and dad and eat himself to 325lbs.Then he decided to lose the weight, but he didn't want to get a job ( or couldn't ) and started a YT channel so he can get money from there while doing push ups from his parents' basement and so he started posting his ""Fitness Journey"".

Upon realizing that nobody is watching he decided to buy a reddit account with 100K positive karma to promote it, spam every fitness subreddit everyday and make 10 other reddit accounts so he can upvote and comment as other people to create ""hype"", deceiving others into thinking he's more popular than he actually is. Some of us noticed immediately but that didn't stop him at [all.Here](https://all.here/)'s a list of all of his alternate accounts:

You don't need to be a brain surgeon to figure it out, he's not that smart to begin with.)

Yes, he made an account with almost the same name as me after I commented what a fraud he is constantly ( the last one on the list). But yesterday after his usual 7 course post work out meal he posted this out of his 2nd main account: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Shower/comments/fb1qoy/showering\_and\_forgot\_my\_soap/fj1r10m/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shower/comments/fb1qoy/showering_and_forgot_my_soap/fj1r10m/?context=3)  
This is the link to the post and this is the picture which he deleted immediately after realizing how much he fucked up: [https://imgur.com/0nFmSLg](https://imgur.com/0nFmSLg)

And before you ask - YES. Joshua SHAT in the shower, STEPPED on it and decided to TAKE A PHOTO and UPLOAD IT reddit.

And this is why I decided to make this post. I don't want any karma, it's to warn YOU and tell you that NO MATTER how out of shape you are, no matter how unmottivated you feel, YOU are 100 times better than the person who SHITS in the SHOWER and POSTS it to Reddit and you will never need ANY of his advice or cliche motivational posts to reach your GOALS.And in the end he isn't doing it for anyone but himself and his selfish reasons.

Exercise,Is there something wrong with me or should I keep going?,"Let me start by saying that I'm aware this isn't a place for getting advice from professionals and doctors, I just want to hear people's opinion since I'm a newbie to exercise and have no idea what it's supposed to feel like. 

**Background info:**

I'm a 19 year old female, 167 cm and approximately 74 kg (5'6 and 163 lbs). I'm probably a few kilos overweight but not to the point where I'm considered fat. I have a pretty sedentary lifestyle. I've done very little exercise in my life, and the problem I'll tackle in this post is the main reason why I always give up exercising so fast. 

**My problem:** 

Now to the problem. The past couple years I've tried several times to start running outside, on a treadmill and the crosstrainer. I just wanted to do some kind of exercising for different reasons, mostly to be a little healthier. The problem is that I literally feel like I can't keep going for more than a few minutes even if the exercise isn't super difficult. The longest I've ever run without stopping is one kilometer. Today I tried out a crosstrainer program that started out easy and got progressively heavier, and after 7 minutes or so I just couldn't do it anymore. 

So, why do I never keep going for more time? Well, mainly because of some pain/discomfort in the chest area. I can't say for sure if it's the lungs, heart or something else, but it's just really unpleasant. There's some kind of pain there. Also, my throat starts to hurt. Breathing kinda hurts. My breathing also becomes weird and a little ""squeaky"". Now it's been over an hour since I exercised, and I'm still coughing. All this from exercising for 7 minutes. 

I checked my heart rate after being the 7 minutes on the crosstrainer today, and my heartbeat was like 175 bpm or so. I've seen it raise to 190 or more sometimes on the treadmill despite running on a pretty low setting. 

**Question:**

Is this just a sign that I'm out of shape and need to keep going or start out softer, or could there be something wrong with my lungs or so? Maybe it's a stupid question. but since I've never been an exerciser I don't know what exercising is supposed to feel like. I don't know what's normal pain and what could be harmful.",Dense-Sheepherder,self.Exercise,1582732175

Exercise,"Today I’ll be entering the gym for the first time, I’m scared","Currently crying in bed. 

I’m scared because I’ve signed up before and spent hundreds of £ without stepping foot in the gym. Every year a friend will hear “I am on a diet” “I’ve bought this exercise machine” and see no results. I’ve had losing weight on my NYE resolution list for 10 years! 10 YEARS!!!!

I get emotional because I don’t know if this will be the time I actually do it or if it will be like before. I’ve lost 8lbs since 20/01/20 on a calorie deficit. Not consistently sticking to it but I’ve got fat to burn. 

I’m 26 y/o, F, 227lbs and 5ft5. I have so much potential to feel and look good. I know this sounds superficial but I want to look good naked. I want to wear a dress and command the room. I want to be small, petite and sexy. I want to be Salma Hayek (LOL, jk). I’ve never had a BF before and want to be married. I’d love for my future husband to see me and think “WOW”. I want the body of a goddess. 

I’ve spent most of my teens and 20s hating my body. I’ve never worn a crop top, bikini and this trauma/eating disorder has shown on my body. Stretch marks, small cellulite and so on. There is a lot of great technology out there to fix the superficial things but I want to challenge myself. To see if my body can transform. I’ll be honest, do I want it bad enough? Probably not. I think it’s just one of those things I need to be consistent with. I’m motivated by results and that’s what will keep me going. I hope so this time. I am getting older...

Will I ever be a bombshell goddess? Wish me luck.

Exercise,Working Lower Back on Leg Day,"Hi all,

My current gym routine consists of hitting back and biceps on Tuesday, and legs on Wednesday, meaning these two workout days are back to back 

On back and biceps, for back I normally do last pull downs, rows (dumbbell rows or a row machine), and isolation rear delts at the end.

On legs, I do multiple workouts and I usually end with glute bridges, which involves working the lower back. Because of this, I’ve began doing my other lower back workout, hyperextensions, on leg day as well right before glute bridges.

Is this okay to do? I have a delicate back as is already so I’m worried about overworking the back or if I’m double-dipping

Exercise,Need help making my butt flatter or at the very least smaller,"So I’m coming here because frankly, I’ve exhausted the Internet and maybe someone more knowledgeable can help. 

So I’m structurally pear shaped meaning I’m aware of the fact that no matter what I do genetically I’ll always hold some weight in my butt/thighs. That’s fine I can live with being uneven but I would loooove a smaller butt. Like I’m talking a small lil thing or maybe even flat I honestly don’t care too much about shape because I don’t think I can fully escape my genetics and it seems to stay somewhat round despite my efforts so I’ve adjusted my goals to simply “smaller”. I’m around 130lbs (5’6”) with some fluctuation but generally I have a really flat stomach and skinny arms and a small bust but no matter what I do the ass just won’t leave me. I don’t want to lose an insane amount of weight so hopefully exercise and healthy diet can help. 

The issue is the only information I can find on how to do this is sitting all day or other unhealthy practices and I really don’t want to harm my body in the process and I want to remain somewhat strong to support my spine because I have back pain, I just want to pop the bubble (butt).

I brought the book because I know I can do it mentally a physically, I just needed something to focus my mind on and at £8 for the book, it made total sense rather than pay for PT sessions or other big promise programmes out there on the market. 

Anyway, I'm part way through my first week of the plan and I wondered if there were any others out there on the plan, how you're getting on with it and what you were doing to stay motivated etc? First week diet strictness has been tough but I've managed to scrape through 🤥

Now I'm back to going to work and school, and most of my day goes by sitting as I work a desk job. When I got home today, I did a full hour on treadmill because of how inactive I was. Most of it was just walking and jogging for 5 minutes every 10 minutes.

But, specifically - I'm going to a gig (of one of my favourite bands) in a few weeks' time (20^th March).

And, that was a few years ago and when I was still slightly active. Now I'm even more sedentary, and about at the heaviest I've ever been. I can still walk around (although my back hurts a little even then) but it's when I'm stuck standing in one place for a long time that really hurts.

I'm feeling really nervous about going to the concert at all and I know I won't enjoy it much if:

a) I have to suffer through pain in my back/feet all night

b) I have to sit down at the side and be reminded of how much of a failure I am, seeing everyone else dancing on their feet

Today I learned that spin class is no joke. I had so much fun and I want to be able to do this more often but I don’t know if I physically can.

Do I need to work on endurance alone before going to spin or should I just power through the classes until I feel like I’m at the normal spin level?

Here’s what I did today. Had 4 eggs for breakfast before class, drank a glass of water, hit a 7:30am class and told them it was my first time, everyone was super friendly and I had a bike near the back, I tried keeping up with the movements as much as possible, I didn’t realize we would be out of the seat most of the time and my thighs burned like the hell, I sat and took a break when I felt like I couldn’t go on anymore, I drank a ton of water throughout the class, got home and ate brunch, then my headache kicked in and wouldn’t go away until I snacked my little heart out and took a 3 hour nap.

Hi

How do you guys manage to make a quick workout session?

I find the whole changing and showering stuff the most time consuming thing at the workout but you cant do it without. Do you hurry or enjoy?

Do you go before work? And/or do you even go twice a day (cardio and free weights)?

How do you keep changing time at minimum?

I just want to start training again and did so easily 4x/week at my study times but now with work it is nearly impossible due to regular overtime hours at work even though I start really early.

So after work I am totally (mentally) exhausted and just want to go home an chill on the couch.

I have noticed that whilst I’m feeling fitter, I am not getting any smaller, in fact the opposite! 
My butt, hips and thighs are becoming bigger...! I don’t want this at all! Whenever I put on weight it goes straight to my stomach and I have always been like that so I know this is from what I am doing at the gym.

Exercise,Bored and uninspired in my routine,"I’m a 29 year old woman. I’ve been doing the same general gym routine for many months. Three or four times a week, I do 30 minutes of cardio on the elliptical with some good resistance, then alternate weight training arms and legs/butt, then I do plank everyday, which I time (up to almost four minutes).

I have a gym at my apartment complex but it’s small. It has some free weights and a weight training thingamabob (lol I dunno what those things are called) plus an elliptical and a treadmill. I can’t afford a gym membership or classes right now plus I don’t have the time or inclination to travel to a gym four times a week. 

My routine has improved my fitness/strength and helped me lose 20 pounds so far along with CICO, but I’ve hit a kind of slump or plateau. I get discouraged and confused by all the different workouts and conflicting information out there. 

My goals: 

- weight loss. I’m down to 163 from 183, and I’d like to lose at least 20 more pounds. 

- toning. I’ve always been “soft”: Even at my thinnest and fittest in high school, I jiggled a bit. It’s my natural state. I’m never going to be model firm. But I’d like to firm up best I can, particularly my legs, butt, and upper arms. My butt is my best feature and I’d like it to be as firm and round as I can make it. Normally I do squats and donkey kicks for my butt

- cardiac and pulmonary health: not much to say about this. 

Anyway, if anyone knows of a particular routine or free online video series that covers my needs and can be done in a small gym with the equipment on hand I’d appreciate it! I also have a resistance band.

I eat regularly now and intuitively even though it does give me a lot of guilt and mental uncomfort. I also enjoy chocolate and junk food evry now and then which furthers my guilt even more but I'm just so scared that I'm slowly just making my way back to my old fatter self that I was before I decided to lose weight before getting anorexic and disordered. Even though I feel huge, I still fit my XS shirts which gives me assurance that I'm getting too big but I can escape the idea thag my shirts have stretched or it's going to happen eventually.

OVERALL, sorry for moaning but I've started doing strength training with dumbbells and a barbell at home. I do 40 mins at least evry other day and I try to aim for at least one Hiit session once a week as well. And I know its not the greatest mentality but it'll really help me eat normally but if I continue this regularly and I am enjoying it, it's not forced but yeah, if I keep up my exercise, will it allow me to eat intuitively with healthy foods and also junk food evry now and then without gaining too much weight and remaining fit? I don't use calories or macros or weight myself becauee it's triggering for me but yeah sorry for this whole mess but I hope someone can help me.

Exercise,Question - Recent Knee pain - are new trainers (Nike Air) the culprit?,"I (36M) recently started doing a routine which introduced a lot of lunging and squating, both dynamic and static (30 day shred). I was using my old gym shoes which were rubber soled (squash shoes) and things were going fine. But i thought I'd get some more cushioned trainers as i wasn't sure the old ones were good for cardio elements of the work out. I bought Nike Air Monarch trainers, which have a full length air cushion in-sole a week or so ago. In the last couple of workouts my knees have started to twinge and i'm getting pains in irregular parts of my legs, even though i have been sticking to the same level workout (2) for last 3 weeks. 

I was wondering whether it was possible going to a fully cushioned/air sole is putting more stress on my stabiliser muscles and knees. I'm hoping that it's a temporary issue as new muscles are being stressed, and my body will adapt. But a little worried the trainers are just a bad match for me. Has anyone come across this? Does this theory sound plausible? If yes is it something everyone should be wary of if they're moving to cushioned shoes from rubber soles?

In case it's relevant i only ever where non-cushion shoes/trainers, so standard office shoes and my old squash trainers for workouts. Thanks!",SpawnOfTheBeast,self.Exercise,1582285398
Exercise,Exercise myths and mistakes - a list for beginners,"I read a lot of myths floating around in posts from folks who are just getting into exercise or are inexperienced. So, I thought I'd put together a list of beginner's myths and mistakes. These have been compiled from my own mistakes, research, and application (in the gym and kitchen). Hope this helps some of you folks who are just getting started.

For those more experienced, please keep in mind that I have simplified a lot of this information, so that beginners may find it easy to absorb.

\-----------------------------

Myths / Mistakes

\-----------------------------

1 - I don't care about building muscle, I just want to burn / lose the fat.

The fact is - building muscle (or more precisely, stimulating muscle growth) and burning fat go hand in hand. When you exercise, you are not only going to burn fat, but you will also send a message to your body that you want more muscle, because you are making it perform physical tasks that it is not used to doing. So, how does it respond ? By adding more muscle, so that you may perform your new exercises more efficiently and safely. You cannot burn fat without adding any muscle. How much muscle you gain is dependent on many factors, but you will gain some in any case.

NOTE - The more muscle you have on your body, the easier you will find it to keep fat off your body long-term, because muscle ""eats"" fat.

\-----------------------------

2 - I want to convert fat into muscle.

Fat and muscle are actually 2 completely different types of body tissue, and cannot be converted to each other. The correct way to think about it is ""I want to burn fat and gain muscle.""

\-----------------------------

3 - I want to burn fat only from around my waist.

Nope, that's not how fat burn works ! You cannot isolate fat burn. Your body will burn fat from all your fat reserves (and they are all over your body, including on your face). You cannot choose where to burn it from.

That said, your genetics may influence where you may lose it the most. Your butt may let fat go only in tiny trickles while it just flows out of other parts.

NOTE - This poses a challenge to some women who would like to reduce belly fat but want to preserve their curves. Yes, you will lose fat from ... everywhere :) Some trial and error will be required to keep the proportions you want.

I have had many female athlete friends who told me they opted for breast implants because they were so athletic that their breasts just ... disappeared ! But this is only a concern if you're a real serious athlete.

\-----------------------------

4 - I'm going to run to my gym and then do my heavy lifting.

If you are going to do any kind of challenging weightlifting, you want to conserve all your energy for it. So, running or performing any other intense activity before lifting is not advisable. If it's a short jog just to get your blood flowing, that's fine. But, you certainly don't want any kind of running or sprinting .. and try to limit the jog to about 5-10 minutes.

Why ? Because lifting relies heavily on Carbohydrates for (instant) energy, so if you deplete your reserves before you get to the gym, you are reducing the amount available for lifting.

\-----------------------------

5 - I'm going to do 30 minutes of Cardio (treadmill / elliptical) before lifting weights.

For the same reason as #4, this is a mistake. Lift first, save the cardio for last.

NOTE - When you lift first (esp. heavy lifting), then do your cardio, it has the nice effect of burning more fat, because lifting depletes Glycogen (Carbohydrates) and your body then turns more to fat reserves for energy when you do Cardio. This the reason why some people do Cardio on an empty stomach - there is no sugar in the blood stream, so the body will rely more heavily on fat for energy, thus burning through your fat reserves more.

\-----------------------------

6 - The longer I stay in the gym, the more effective my workout.

Not at all ! The results you see will be dependent on training intensity, not on duration. If your workout looks like the following, realize that you're not getting the most out of your workout:

1 minute slow/easy exercise

2 minutes changing tracks on your phone

5 minutes speaking to your buddy

1 more minute slow/easy exercise

3 minutes answering an urgent work email on your phone

...

60-90 minutes in the gym ... your heart rate is so low you can sing opera ... ok I've spent a good amount of time here, I've done my part. Let's go home.

However, if your workout looks more like this, chances are you are maximizing your workout effectiveness:

1 minute intense exercise

45-60 seconds rest

1 more minute intense exercise

45-60 seconds rest

1 more minute intense exercise

...

Done in 30-40 minutes ... you feel the blood surging everywhere, you feel your heart pounding

Of course, intensity should start low and increase only as long as it is safe, given your injuries and medical conditions. But, results are directly proportional to intensity, not to duration.

The exception to this \^ rule, of course, is if you're an endurance athlete training for a marathon. If endurance is your goal, then yes, a longer workout may help build endurance.

\-----------------------------

7 - 5 sets of an exercise is better than 3 sets

Not always. In fact, I'd say that 3 really good sets of almost any exercise should be enough to fatigue your muscles and stimulate muscle adaptation/growth. They say that some bigger muscles like thighs require more sets because of their size ... that is debatable. I still favor 3-4 intense sets.

What is a good set ? A set where you're focused, you've picked a weight such that you are able to maintain good form, good range of motion, and you're not stopping before you're even challenged (see #9).

One cannot argue with the fact that doing 3 good focused intense sets is much better than doing 5 crappy half-hearted sets.

\-----------------------------

8 - More reps is better

Similar to #6, doing fewer reps but good focused ones is much better than doing many half-hearted reps. So, stop staring off into space (addressed in #13), connect your mind with the muscle you are working, and do really good reps !

NOTE - #7 and #8 imply #6. If you do good reps and good sets, you need to spend much less time in the gym to see the same results. So, all the more incentive to focus !

\-----------------------------

9 - Stopping as soon as you feel the slightest bit of burn in the muscle

This is a massive noob mistake ! You need to realize that the last few repetitions of an exercise are the most important ones ... they are the reps that will stimulate muscle adaptation/growth. So if you start to feel a slight burn on rep 10 and you immediately stop, you have just wasted your time ! But, if you push forward through that discomfort barrier and do 2-3 more reps, till you're no longer able to do a single rep with good form, then you're signaling your body that it needs to get stronger ... that will stimulate gains !

If you're always playing it safe, your body will also be happy doing nothing in response ... the way you tell your body you want to get stronger is to get past the discomfort barrier. If you're not doing new physical tasks the body has never performed before, why would you need more muscle ?

NOTE - Of course, there is a distinction between normal soreness and injury from improper form or excess weight. Pay attention to the discomfort. Most people can intuitively tell the difference between the normal burning sensation at the end of a set of lifting weights vs an abnormal pain caused by hurting yourself. Pay attention, but try to get past your comfort zone.

\-----------------------------

10 - Holding your breath during a set

You absolutely need to breathe, throughout your exercise. Never hold your breath.

Beginners will find it challenging to develop a proper breathing rhythm. Follow this general rule, and it will become second nature over time:

Inhalation - Inhale when performing the less challenging half of a single repetition, i.e. the lowering of the weight. Example, let's say you're doing biceps curls. The part when you're lowering the dumbbell is when you would inhale.

Exhalation - Exhale as you perform the more challenging half of a single repetition, i.e. the ""lifting"" part of the rep. Example, let's say you're doing biceps curls. The part when you're lifting the dumbbell is when you would exhale.

\-----------------------------

11 - Heavier is better

Guys will be more familiar with this syndrome. You see the big guy next to you curling 50 lbs, so you grab the 35's ... you start swinging the weights (only halfway) up and down till your set looks more like a Zumba dance than a biceps curl.

If you do this, you will get results ... not the kind that you wanted, but the kind that your physiotherapist had hoped for, because you will end up injuring yourself. Not only that, you have probably done zero to stimulate any muscle growth.

The number one priority should always be proper form and range of motion. If you cannot do a rep smoothly in full muscular control of the weight ... without swinging or jerking your body, you're lifting too heavy. Put your ego aside, and grab the lighter weights. When you can do all reps in good form, and it's easy, yes, go heavier.

\-----------------------------

12 - Using momentum instead of muscular work

Similar to #11, this usually happens when the selected weight is too heavy. Typically, people do this with biceps curls or lat-pulldowns. If you use your body's momentum to move the weight, you're not utilizing the muscles that you want to target, and hence, the exercise will not produce the right stimulus for the muscle to get stronger.

For instance, with lat-pulldowns, if you jerk your torso backwards to bring the weight down, you may look cool (or not), but your lats are doing almost no work, so you won't get results. Again, your physiotherapist may enjoy seeing you exercise with momentum because he knows you'll be visiting him soon.

\-----------------------------

13 - Going through the motions / staring off into space during a set

If you just go through the motions without concentrating your effort so that the right load is placed on your muscles, you are better off on the couch at home watching TV, because at least you're paying attention when watching TV ! No attention = no stimulus and no adaptation / growth.

Pay attention when you exercise. Know which muscle you are exercising. Don't do an exercise just because you saw some other guy doing it and it looked cool. If you know which muscle you are targeting, that will help you focus your effort during the actual set. Feel the muscle as it is being worked. Feel every contraction ... this is sometimes called ""mind-muscle connection"".

If you don't even feel your targeted muscle during the set, you're wasting your time.

Example - You come to the lat-pulldown machine. Take a moment to understand what you will be doing - Ok, this works my ""lats"" on the sides of my back. Then, focus your attention on the lats muscles during the set.

\-----------------------------

14 - Busting your butt in the gym and then driving to McDonald's for lunch

This is a HUGE mistake ! If you work hard in the gym and then eat bad foods, you're undoing a lot of the work you did in the gym.

If you're exercising hard and wondering why you're not seeing positive results, examine your diet.

\-----------------------------

15 - ""Whole grain"" bread

There are very few ""whole grain"" breads that actually live up to their name. The only genuine whole grain bread I know of is ""sprouted bread"" by a brand named Ezekiel. There may be others, but I have not come across them.

How can you tell if a bread or other product is truly whole grain ?

Look at the ingredients. If you see the word ""flour"" anywhere, dump it like shit down a toilet. Whole grain flour is just as bad for you as any other flour. There is nothing whole grain about it if it has flour.

This \^ is one of the biggest scams in the food industry.

\-----------------------------

16 - Fat is bad

Not quite. Certain types of fats (trans fats, found in fast foods) are bad. Consuming fats in large amounts (&gt; 100 gm per day) is not advisable. Unsaturated fats in small amounts are not only good but required for proper body functioning.

As an example, the yolks in eggs help stimulate testosterone production (that's a good thing). So, is egg fat bad ? Only if you eat too much. Most people can safely eat 1-2 yolks a day.

\-----------------------------

17 - Not eating enough protein

First understand this - we don't build muscle in the gym. In fact, we damage muscle in the gym. When we go home and rest is when we build (repair) the muscle, using protein. Most of this happens when we sleep. So, there's a great reason to get your 8 hours of sleep each night !

Protein is to muscle what bricks are to a house. Without eating enough protein (at least 50 gm / day for active females, 75 gm / day for active males), you're wasting your effort in the gym and may even end up losing muscle (called ""atrophy"").

Try to get enough protein and from various sources as per your preferences / food allergies, etc. Dairy, poultry, meats, fish, soya, powdered supplements, lentils / pulses, beans, nuts / nut butters, and even some vegetables (e.g. spinach, broccoli, peas).",GregFeith,self.Exercise,1582274089

I do like lifting weights and getting stronger and I hear you’re burning calories while your muscles repair so I don’t want to stop. 
I’m pretty new to all this so if anyone can give me advice on what worked for them so I can have a better idea on how to come up with a plan for my body that’d be very much appreciated.
I do know nutrition is a big part in weight loss and I have made plenty of adjustments to eat healthier and to drink plenty of water.

Exercise,Question? Is walking 10K in one stretch better than 5K twice a day,"Sorry about the vague question, but this is something that has been bothering me. I used to go walking like 10KM in the evening, listening to podcasts and stuff and my weight reduced quite a bit. 

But recently I started 5KM to work and back home every day morning and evening, but I don't feel it to have that much effect on me as doing 10K at a stretch.

Exercise,Pool only open in morning - get headache and stomach ache later in the day,"Hi!

So quick details. I am trying to start swimming once a week,  but the pool is only available before work. That means exercising ca 7-7.30. I am not a huge breakfast person. I read that there are both benefits and drawbacks to exercising before you eat,  but that seemed to apply to professional athletes, not just a random gal not concerned with peak performance. 



I have tried exercising twice so far. 


First time, I drank water before and during practice, and are breakfast after. Headache and stomach ache the rest of the day.  
Second time, I woke up earlier, again drank water and this time had a bowl of müsli before exercising. Downed a fluid replacement thingy meant for post exercise, that I got at a supermarket.  Headache but no stomach ache. 

I am getting quite disheartened if ecercise have to mean at least headache all day. Anyone else had the same problem? Since trial and error could mean numerous days of headaches I'd love some advice from other non-morning-or-breakfast people who started exercising in the morning.

I’m currently on a ketogenic diet in an attempt to lose weight, as I have put on a lot in my early adulthood years despite being a healthy weight/borderline underweight most of my life. The main goal is primarily to burn fat and get back to a healthy weight. The diet’s helped me lose ~10kg so far without exercise, but I now want to start getting fit again.

Some quick info about me if necessary, I’m 21 and about 6 foot in height. Currently floating around 87kg. I started to pile on this weight after I finished school (between the years of 18-21). My goal is probably 70kg.

I’m very, very uneducated in the area of working out and especially with gym equipment. I don’t have a gym membership, but I have my own little somewhat of a home gym. I have a cycling machine, weights, and one that I don’t know the name of, but it is kinda like a two in one machine with lat pull downs and leg raises. I don’t even know if those are proper terminology so forgive me 😂

Once I am back at a healthy weight, I want to start trying to build muscle and get into shape. So what activities should I start with and progress towards? Keeping in mind that the initial goal is to burn fat and then build muscle.",-Bods-,self.Exercise,1582124551

So I love jumping rope for my cardio. I used to do it regularly last whole summer and build a really healthy routine. 

I have recently moved to an apartment to another city. Back at home, I used to exercise in my yard because it had enough space and no one was really around to witness that. Now that I got here, I barely have enough space in my room to move around and can only do workouts that are quiet and don't require much space. Also, the only gym I can go to  is always packed and doesn't have any room for things you want to do except on their equipment (there is just a bike for cardio).

So now, I'm really self-conscious about doing it in places outside of the gym or where on streets are constantly passing by, and I have no idea how to fix this situation. 

My question is, could anyone suggest me a place for that?  I'm really self conscious around other people's but the gym would be fine since everyone is already there to work out! But unfortunately I can't get to one.

I've come to the conclusion that I'm probably going to start filming myself quite often, but as I've said I used to think it was silly when Ive seen other people do this.

Lets say I do 20 reps of a 10lb dumbell, by my second set my biceps want to cramp and I have to keep my arms extended until the tightness subsides otherwise my arms want to curl and cramp. This happens to my abdomen too, albeit far more painful because it's harder to keep a position that keeps it stretched out. I'm not sure if I'm getting into it to fast or not stretching enough/properly.

Any advise would be appreciated, as I feel like I cramp a lot in general.",acurtis85,self.Exercise,1581385969

We loved to use resistance bands ourselves because of their versatility and portability but we were missing the workout instructions of a trainer as well as the ability to track your progress, so we invented the STRAFFR Band and App. We are not on the market yet but I would love to get your feedback to see if our invention could make a difference in your life and help you to be fitter, healthier and exercise more?

Exercise,Boxers step Jump rope trick like Floyed Mayweather - Complete tutorial," To do the Mayweather version of the boxer step you definitely have to flex at the hip to tilt upper body forward and get mini high knees with your legs thrusting them out a little as you bounce on the balls of your feet. As you out these to actions your feet without much body weight has higher elevation lifting the heel high from the floor. Your hands should be flexed at the elbow making your forearm almost horizontal with the floor, this may depend sometimes on the length of your rope. Moving behind by pushing your toes while jumping creates his complete routine. Those are few variations from the regular boxer step.

Upper body movement is where bodyweight alternation occurs and when paired correctly with feet positioning your flow will be fluid. Use these tips to also add spice to your boxer step routine like Floyd Mayweather by creating your rhythm and changing foot work with each rhythm. Check the video for 3 footwork tricks.

Your ability to control your rhythm and speed of jumps determines how well you can swap positions like Floyd Mayweather. Slow down your whips and your speed decreases.

I tend to use these five minutes to walk about and/or grab a drink, but I'll always cram in at least a minute or two of exercise. Usually, I'm grabbing a 15 lb weight and just getting as many reps in as I can before I get back down to work.

This isn't the only exercise I do, but I'm trying to determine if there's any lasting benefit to doing such short blasts of exercise every 25 minutes or if I'm basically just killing time with a weight.

Exercise,Advice: The Value of Novelty,"Background: Prior college athlete, current military, 29 with about 6 years of quality lifting experience, no formal exercise education (so take it with a grain of salt).

This is geared towards beginner lifters with purely anecdotal evidence from my personal experience. For about the last 2 years, I've focused on a weekly full-body routine, cycling intensity for 3-4week mesocycle with different rep ranges and goals (strength/power, hypertrophy, muscle endurance). I really focused on this since last September, running two cycles of MAPS Aesthetic routine. It has given me plenty of success and provided enough variety and stimulus to rarely plateau.

But the point I want to make is the value of novelty. I recently switched towards a traditional hypertrophy-based, PPL split with progression focused more on volume adaptation (Mike Israetel recently did a youtube series on this scheduling, and JTS has great resources on hypertrophy guides in general). I have not experienced this dramatic of adaptation since the ""newbie gains,"" and I can absolutely say that a healthy dose of novelty is always achievable. That being said, now that I have started on my first mesocycle of a PPL split, I can also say that too much novelty is, in my opinion, worse than not enough. If you're constantly chasing the next program or switching up your routine, you're losing the bigger benefit of progressive overload. I've done this in the past, chasing the most recent research implications to incorporate into my programming. 

Bottom line: Learn how to best understand and apply change to your training modalities instead of chasing the next routine.",TodyCrudeau,self.Exercise,1580932614

Exercise,Treadmill question,"Hi all,

So, based on how my inner thighs feel atm, I think I know the answer to this but I'd like your (collective and varied) opinions anyway.

I have an older model treadmill (20+ years. It was a hand me down) and recently I had it serviced because it was stopping randomly (I wasn't injured.  It didn't STOP; more like, stoppp).

I had been running on it and the tech suggested walking on a steep incline would be better for it and safer for me, and just as effective as running.

So, here are three scenarios (today was scenario 3, btw).

1.  Running/jogging approx 21-ish min mile on an incline of about 4.5 ish.  That would be pretty much it. I'd vary speed and incline.

2. Walking approx 22-23 min mile on an incline of about 9-10 (I'd vary it depending on how I felt, to catch up).  I'd do one mile/4 laps, maybe 5 laps.

3. 27-ish min mile on an incline of 11-12, varied.  Today I did 6 laps.

Def feel it in my inner thighs lol

With just this basic info for the exercise itself, is either scenario better/equal/different?

I get past my warm up and a short way through the quick walk and I start breathing very heavily. When I'm jogging, I start heaving, can't catch my breath or take a breath that feels big enough. It makes me feel panicky and I have to stop the jog until I feel like I'm getting adequate oxygen into my lungs. How do I overcome this?

I appreciate your time and advice. 

Backstory: once upon a time I was super fit working out 2x a day and loved every minute of it. 

Fast forward to present day: I dropped the ball and haven’t been in the gym or eating even moderately healthy for the past 2 years. I turned my back on my health thinking it would allow more time for me to focus on my career- I should have been more disciplined and maintained my fitness- it probably would have done wonders for my mental health- ANYWAY-

Today is the day- I can take no more. I just got a myself a new gym membership but have to admit I am intimidated. 

I have no idea where to start. I’ve watched my muscles and body atrophy to the point where I do not even recognize myself or strength. 

Where do you start? 

I know I need to build a solid base before I go back to doing the things I loved in the past -(heavy high bar backsquats, clean and jerks, and weighted pull-ups)

Should I start with the classic 5x5x5? Is there a body weight regiment I should do for the first 2/3 weeks?

So I'm new to this part of reddit, but I'm starting to exercise again! I'm wondering if anyone has any input for me on the following plan:

The idea:
Aim for 3 workouts a week.
1) arms and abs
2) legs
3) a combo

I'm looking at doing a max capacity session each week to see what my limit is for the week and them basing the rest of my workouts at 80% of that limit x3. So I'll do one rep on pushups as far as I can go, the n look to do 3x80% of that limit.

I havent quite figured out what exercises exactly yet, but still. Has anyone done something similar or set a routine around that?

The cardio will likely be most, if not all, of my cardio work for the week; how long should I be hiking for each trip, and will I see substantially increased results from going fast compared to taking my time and not pushing to the point of constant exhaustion?

In the gym, assuming one is working/rotating everything throughout the week, how much work is too much? Does injury become a concern if I'm pushing too fast?

Exercise,Suggestions for treadmill desk substitute for inside small RV please,"When I lived in a house I had a treadmill with arms that I placed a 1"" x 12"" piece of wood across to serve as a desk to work on my computer while walking uphill. Sometimes I'd take a break and jog or run on it too. I loved it.           
                      
Now I've been traveling in an RV for a couple of years, settling into a longer term stay in various places... and needing to do more work at the computer again... missing my treadmill set-up. There isn't enough room in our small RV for that type of treadmill (even though it folded up), nor can we afford the weight it had (was quite heavy).            
                             
Anyone have experience or ideas for something I can do in our RV while using the computer?                 
                       
I have walkway space of about 22"" x 114"" to work with... but it also has to be something I can tuck away when not in use.               
                           
I've put a cutting board across the propane stove top and stand in front of the oven kind of like a standing desk to help mix things up a bit.. and sometimes sway and semi squat.. but all that is something I sort of need to focus on to remember to keep at it, whereas the walking was something I would just unconsciously keep doing, for miles and miles. (I have always been able to take day long hikes and/or be on my feet all day, so perhaps that's why).                  
                    
For those interested in details and dimensions: The body of the RV is 20' long and 8' wide, and the walkway is about 28"" wide (at floor, but drawers, cabinets, handles, etc make it only about 22"" wide at stove) and 114"" long (with the bathroom door closed).

Exercise,The 8 Really Obvious Ways to Workout Better Than You Ever Did,"For the majority of the people in this world, getting motivated to exercise or even beginning to exercise is difficult. But there are a few of us who actually do the opposite of this… We exercise too much.

Here are the top 8 obvious ways to workout effectively:

**Go for high-intensity workouts**

If you are new to exercise, go slow. Build your stamina gradually. When you are running or cycling, try to build up your endurance. Do it for at least one month. Only then get into intense exercise. First, focus on building your endurance. You can then work on sharpening the intensity to make it more effective for you.

**Include protein in your diet**

Proteins are a must if you have certain fitness goals. If you want to build your muscles properly, say yes to proteins. You will not avail a lot from a workout if you do not include enough protein in your daily diet. When you do cardio and strength workouts, you need protein as well for proper muscle building. The best sources of protein that you can go for are whey protein and soy protein shakes.

**Go for the right cardio exercise**

Go for an exercise form that suits you and that engages you the most. You can choose your ideal one from running, walking, swimming, hiking, etc. Once your body gets accustomed to this type of exercise, the fun begins!

**Drink water**

You ought to drink a good deal of water if you want to focus on your muscles. In short, you need to keep yourself hydrated throughout the day. This is truly vital. Your body might take some time to absorb the water. Thus, you need to drink the right amount of water before exercise. Get into this healthy habit if you wish to build your muscles.

**Shake well!**

You can get into the habit of taking protein shakes before and after the workout. You can even go for a protein/carb shake. When you take this healthy shake before your workout, it betters the flow of amino acids to your muscles in your body. This is necessary when you train hard. This way your muscles get a good deal of energy to build up. Once you are done with the workout, this shake leads to the stimulation of muscle growth.

You can consider taking a small protein/carb meal one hour after a workout. Keep in mind that a meal replacement bar works well for many. So, go for it!

**Go for compound exercises**

Go for exercises that work on more than one muscle group. It will benefit you more. Try not to go for exercises like a bicep curl. Rather, consider going for a full-body workout. Keep in mind that all of your muscles work together. Some of the good compound exercises are inclusive of squats, deadlifts, pushups, bench presses, military presses, rows, pullups, etc.

**Include carbs as well**

Carbs might be of some importance as well! Low-carb is no good. However, carbs form your body’s major source of fuel. If you are into intense workouts, you will have to include carbs in your diet. Without carbs, you might not get the energy and drive to do intense workouts. You can add some carbs into your shake. You can also go for a banana. It is a good low fiber food that contains high glycemic carbohydrates. You need such carbohydrates to exercise.

**Try to balance lifting**

Balance is key, once again! Try to do lifting in standing posture. This will benefit you more. This way you will be forced to balance yourself at the time of lifting. This will put all of your core muscles into action. It increases your overall body strength and helps you lift better the next time.

Say yes to slow lifting. Try to lift and lower to a 5-second count in both directions. Go for heavier weight. You can start with lower weights. This will help you focus on your form. You can then lift the heaviest weights.

However, you must never sacrifice your form for heavyweights. Both are important! When you strike the right balance, it gives you the best possible fitness results. Even if you do not wish to get muscular, lifting heavy weights can help you in maintaining overall fitness.

You must focus on increasing your effectiveness. You can do so by lifting heavyweights.

In order to increase your effectiveness, you can play with toys as well. This will increase the fun element. In order to increase the intensity, you can add a prop. Some of the useful props are dumbbells, kettlebells, sliding discs, etc. These are easily available at gyms. You can also purchase these from online websites. With these props, you can increase the effectiveness of moves like pushups and crunches.

Good props boost your aerobic capacity. These also enhance your core strength as well as dynamic balance. These also help you reduce a good number of calories in short time-periods.

Consider getting competitive. A little competition can make it fun for you. When you competitive, you tend to stay motivated to go forward with your fitness routines. You do not need people to pity you or console you here! You need people to help you push a bit harder than the previous day! This is a great way to work out harder. So, get a workout partner or group.

Focus on increasing the intensity of your workout. Even if you lessen the workout time, it will pay off if you increase the intensity.

You can go for interval training. Through this, you can sharpen the intensity of your workout sessions. It helps you reduce your abdominal fat as well as body weight. The good thing is that the muscle mass is maintained.

Put on some good music. Music works well for a workout! Identify as to what type of playlist really works for you. Try to collect songs that make you feel liberated and motivated. When you have good music playing in the background, you get to work harder effortlessly. It also helps you to maintain consistency. A soft piece of music can have a great impact on you while hard rock can suit your friend more. You need to single out your kind of songs!

Last year I exercised slightly more and definitely had zero issues with tired/heavy legs. It almost feels like I have cement blocks for feet. I am above average athletically and so this has really been playing with my head lately.

A little background... I tore both Achilles’ tendons; one in 2016 and the other in 2018, but came back in great shape and even got my vertical and jumping back to normal. Carrying a little more weight the last few years 205 lbs at 6’ 2”.

Exercise,Swimming vs Running,"Hi all! 

Just running into a few obstacles with my weight loss goals....

So I’ve decided to go full on and go swimming 5 days a week. During this time I do about 30 minutes of breaststroke each of the 5 days (which my app and watch tell me burns 250-300 calories each session). My diet has also changed drastically, I’m eating less than 2000 calories a day and not eating anything after 6pm. I’m really really happy with this lifestyle and have really settled down - we had a takeaway the other night and I couldn’t even finish a portion (compared to the 2 portions I’d normally eat!) - so my stomach seems to have shrunk as well! 

I’ve been doing this for 3 weeks now and my dilemma and issue is this: the numbers on the scales are not changing! 

Previously, when I tried to lose some weight, I’d pretty much eat the same as I did before 2500-3000 calories and do maybe 2 runs a week (when I say ‘run’ I mean a 45 minute walk/light jog or a 30 minute cycle) which burnt about 120-150 calories each time - within 1 week I’d lost a few kilograms, but I was not happy with the effort that running took and how much it fatigued me whereas with swimming I’m enjoying it so much more and can do it up to 5 times a week without feeling like my body can’t go for a swim. 

My question is this: How can I do 5 swims a week for 3 weeks (burning 250-300 calories each time) and drastically changing my diet and have only lost 1.5 kilos, but do 2 runs a week for 2 weeks and lose 6-8 kilos whilst not changing diet?

Is my method (swimming &amp; diet) a slow burner? I.e. I’ll start seeing results in a few more weeks and is running a quick burner (instant results)? 

I really love this current lifestyle - I feel fitter, happier and healthier and my wife says I look a little more trim, but ultimately, I judge my weight lost by the weight I’ve lost - which, at the moment, is nothing! 

Any help or advice appreciated! 

Thanks all!",Lazarus5687,self.Exercise,1580231799
Exercise,Muscle imbalance,"I began working out last week and my right butt cheek, thigh and calf feels more overworked than my left. It’s not a new thing as I noticed it a while ago while I was on a long walk. My right calf is noticeably thinner. My right buttock doesn’t look thinner, but it FEELS a lot smaller than the left. It isn’t my imagination because my mum said when I walk I lean to the left. My brother pointed out how my right calf is thinner than my left. I googled it and I self diagnosed a tilted pelvis so I am going to try the exercises to correct it. Could anyone on here share their experience of muscle imbalances and if it sounds like I do have a tilted pelvis? Thankyou :)",MissPossible,self.Exercise,1580229274

Exercise,Ex power-lifter goes Calisthenics route (-20kg lost),"Hey guys! My name is Elvis! I am new here and I wanted to

to share \[my progress\]([https://ibb.co/zNsWnTq](https://ibb.co/zNsWnTq)) in losing weight with everyone! I posted my progress on Reddit in other group and received excellent feedback which motivates me even more to work hard and never give up on my goal and dream! I figured that my journey belongs in this community too because sometimes I go to the gym (sometimes I do gym work, calisthenics, cardio so fitness in general) and I am a bodybuilding fan. 

Lets hope this post motivates someone because nothing feels better than motivate someone else with your hard work! 

Some background about me I used to go to the gym and I trained a power lifter style 3-5 rep range. I always was big but never lean. I got quite strong and still am but I always wanted to be lean and ripped.

Having a 6 pack was my goal even at very young age but I always find some excuse to eat wrong foods. But somehow last summer around mid July I listened to a audio book some people might know it some not. The book is written by David Goggins it's called ""Can't hurt me"" and I have to say it changed my life completely.

It ignited the fire and motivation that I needed for the breakthrough and after that I set myself my own goals! Now eating clean diet with maybe 5% cheat food is my new lifestyle. I pretty much live the lifestyle which seemed unreasonable before!

I workout pretty much everyday (I don't recommend this to beginners) and my diet is high in protein with healthy fats (omega's) and complex carbs like oatmeal for example. 

I don't drink soda, nor I eat fast food, I am not a smoker and I seldom drink. At first you might think this lifestyle is boring but when you realize that health should be your number one priority in life your thinking changes! 

Little story my blood pressure was very high for my weight and height. Maybe because of power lifting im not sure.. or maybe because I have high genetic BP so I have to live healthy to sustain my good health so when I get older I still have amazing health and strong heart etc. So this is very important to me. Every kg/lbs of weight just raises my blood pressure.

People get used to everything and that was key for me. I just had to get trough the first two weeks of diet and a lot of exercise before I get used to it. Now it's my lifestyle and so far I have lost 20kg/45lbs. I look better, I feel better, my sleep has improved, my mood is not that aggressive and depressed I think more positive about life in general. I don't regret not eating sweet stuff like candy at all after a while you just don't even crave it that much. And in my opinion this is the only way to get the results we want. We have to change the lifestyle/mindset to actually progress!

I have my entire journey filmed and I made a transformation/motivation video so if someone is interested in my journey you can check me out on YouTube just type ElvisLifts and you will find me! Any support is highly appreciated!

If you have any questions feel free to ask!

Some stats about me:

My height is 1.89m

My starting weight was 114kg/251lbs

My current weight is 94kg/207lbs

My blood pressure was 170/65 now it is 130/75

Power lifting stats before transition these are personal best:

1. Bench press 152.5kg

2. Squat 190kg

3. Deadlift 225kg

At the moment my lifts in gym would not be that high but I am fine with that.",ElvisLifts,self.Exercise,1580203475
Exercise,Abs Workout At Home With Just One Dumbbell,"I framed an ab workout to add up better definition to abs &amp; obliques muscles.

**1. Weighted Crunches**

**2. Weighted Leg Raise**

**3. Wide Cross Toe Touches**

**4. Dumbbell Side Bend**

I know there's nothing fancy in this. But these exercises are effective in terms of hypertrophy and muscle definition.

This workout will shape up and grow your abs. But to make it visually appealing, I strongly recommend to follow a strict fat loss diet in combination with this workout to make your abs aesthetically look good.

Give this a try whenever you don't have time to workout your abs in the gym.

TL;DR: I'm chronically disabled and very weak, my joints dislocate under too much pressure and my heart rate is always high. I want to gain more muscle so my joints stay in place better but my disabilities make exercise hard. any advice is appreciated 

Hey all! I've been really wanting to lose weight and get some muscle for years now, I've been disabled since birth (its progressive, i was better when I was younger!) and my activity plummeted in middle school when I started having surgeries and got really sick. I recently graduated high school and i'm as weak as i've ever really been. I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and POTS, which to sum up means i'm very flexible and my joints (mostly knees) dislocate frequently, and i have trouble doing cardio because my heart is constantly beating in the 120s-130s when i'm standing. despite all this, I really want to find something that works well for me, I'm sick of not feeling confident and comfortable. If i'm stuck in this body I at least want it to look okay, right? lol. Two years ago I joined a gym and was hospitalized after my first day from just walking the treadmill too fast, my BPM was 220. So if you can see my dilemma haha. My biggest goal is to gain a bit more muscle and get stronger, I'm far too weak and my joints just fall out of place when I roll in bed, I want something to hold them there. Does anyone have tips on how I could get started bettering myself? anything is appreciated, thank you!",heyzoom,self.Exercise,1580154592

- Doesn’t make my calves and legs too thick. I love effective functional exercises that help develop speed and power, but my legs always size up fast... is the key to incorporate more cardio over weights?
- Doesn’t require me to be in too much flexion, including seated positions (herniated disc, best to be in extension). This means I avoid squats and DLs

I know i have enough leg strength and a reasonable amount of arm strength, the rest of my body... Needs work... A lot of work...

I'm already fairly flexible and have a large range of motion, which means exercises focussing on that might be good for motivation.

What i already do:
1,5 hours of walking a day (dog walking, and groceries)
1,5 hours a week of cycling (5 hour during summer)
Often being unable to sit still for more than 20 minutes probably helps too...

What i plan to add:
Bodyweight exercises and kettle bell training 3 times a week.
15 minutes on monday to start, but eventually adding in 15 minutes on Thursday and Saturday too, before increasing exercise time to up to an hour.

So what exercises can i start with having only 2 kettle bells (1kg and 12kg)  and no money to buy more equipment",Aeonir,self.Exercise,1580123324

Exercise,My weight loss journey -20kg/45lbs,"Hey everyone! 🤩

This is how I lost about 20kg/45lbs since I started taking fitness and diet seriously.

Stats:

Time period : 6 months
Training type : Calisthenics+Cardio
Cardio : running, swimming, cycling, box

Starting weight 114kg
Current weight 94kg
Height 1.89m

Training schedule:

Calisthenics 4-5 Times a week
Cardio 3-5 times a week

Progress I Made:

Dips from 9 to 29
Pullups from 6 to 19 (form in 19 is even better)
One arm dead hang 10 seconds to 35
Lsit from 3 seconds to 20

Moves that I mastered:

1. Archer push-ups
2. Archer pullups
3. L-sit
4. One arm pushups (not perfect form)

My diet consisted no added sugar, no soda, no bread, no fast food. I eat mostly healthy carbs with some good fats and a lot of protein. Also having no bad habits is optimal I do not smoke and seldom drink. I have a decent sleep schedule so that definetly helps!

I made I compilation video of my body transformation! Last time I posted my progress I've received good feedback and a lot of comments of support which encouraged me to train even harder! So I decided to share my passion and progress with you guys so hopefully someone gets motivated/inspired if right now you don't feel like putting in the work 💪.

Im not going to post any links if you want to check my progress out type ElvisLifts on youtube and you will find me.

In my opinion the most important thing is being consistent and just do the work not all workouts will be great some days weather sucks or whatever excuse it may be but you have to keep the ball moving in the right direction there are only two options moving forward or going backwards.  ",ElvisLifts,self.Exercise,1579972123

I feel like the muscles responsible for keeping them up aren't able to endure as much as they should.

Exercise,"[Tips/Discussion] I’m 18, 6’0”, 195 lbs, male, and new to working out. Any pointers or suggestions? (Relevant health and workout history inside)","TL;DR: I’m strong but I have never really worked out. I have a 10 lb dumbbell and a Peloton that I’ve done four 10 minute sessions on. What should I do for workouts?

Hi everybody. I’m interested in working out and getting in better shape. Determined too. I wanna be the best I can be. Problem there is I don’t know what appropriate limits are (as you’ll see later*). Here’s some of my exercise/health history. 

A little over a year ago, some side effects from my 7(!) prescriptions got me up to 295 pounds. Dropped the medications, forced myself into good mental health with an iron hand, and dropped 100 pounds since a year ago through nothing besides minor dieting and simply not taking the medications. Currently 195, but I wanna drop some more fat and build muscle (and maybe fill out some of this loose skin). 

In terms of arm and leg exercise, I work in a deli. I regularly carry up to 100 pounds at work and at home with virtually no sweat. I lift and carry up to 70 pounds from a squatting or kneeling position at work. 

*My one time exercising (and failing miserably): One time I decided to do curls with a 10 pound dumbbell on my right arm until I physically couldn’t anymore, then the same for my left arm, then back to my right arm as it had some time to “recharge”, then back to my left, and I did that for roughly 35 minutes. That left me unable to straighten my arms for a week and a half. That was my first and last workout, and it was about a year ago. Come to think of it, I was definitely doing it wrong. Not really controlling the “down part”, not rotating it, just up and down as much as I could. Not as fast as I could, just as much as I could. 

My family recently got a Peloton, and I’ve ridden it 4 times. Each time has been a 10 minute “scenic” ride (no instructor, just riding with a video playing in front of you) and my distance has always been a little over 3 miles. I keep the resistance between 45 and 55 the entire time, which according to my mother who has ridden 40something days in a row (and used to row a lot and bike marathons) is “uphill”. Tired as hell when I finish, but I do make it through. I try to push myself throughout, and go as hard as I can for the last 30 seconds. 

My questions: 

What should I eat? Cheap/affordable is ideal, and I don’t mind bland. I have spices. I love chickpeas with garlic powder and salt. When should I eat? What should I do to work out? Most days of the week I’m at or getting ready for school and work from 6:30 am until 9:45 pm. Weekends I work either 6 hours or 8 1/2 hours each day. I work 6 days a week, and my day off is entirely random. In terms of equipment, I have two 3 pound dumbbells, two 5 pound dumbbells, two 7 1/2 pound dumbbells, a 10 pound dumbbell, and a Peloton. I might still have a rowing machine in the basement. I’d be willing to spend up to $50 on heavier dumbbells if it seems necessary. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any and all input is greatly appreciated. Have a nice day :)",AnodaWonne,self.Exercise,1579574015

Exercise,Getting fit in your 30s after being a couch potato entire life,"Hi has anyone had any success getting fit after the age 30 when you were chubby and sluggish since your childhood? Do you think it's possible?

I'm 32 and I've been overweight since age 6. I've always hated exercise and I've always been the worst and slowest from my class in all fitness tests done in school.

Two years ago when i was 30 i had backpain and i found it difficult to get off the couch. I was 89kg and my height is only 150cm which was morbidly obese. The moment of joint and muscle pain opened my eyes and I've decided never to get to that point again.

Since then I've slowly lost 17kg and I'm almost ""just overweight"" instead of ""morbidly obese"". Last week i got a fitness plan done by a coach to make my efforts more systematic and effective.
I'm also in psychotherapy.

Now i got into a phase in my thinking when i not only want to lose weight. I actually want to be fit and healthy. I want when someone looks at me, they would think ""she's strong and healthy"". I got couch to 5k app and my goal is to do it by the end of this year. (i have realistic goals since i don't believe i can do it in 2-3 months or so 😅).

I'm looking for some information and perhaps some links to find the right indoor exercise bike for me. I have no experience at all with any exercise machine apart from a very old indoor bike along with a treadmill, both of which I no longer own.

The problem that I have been having is that I just dont really know what I'm looking at. As far as im aware all I really need is resistance and for the bike to be steady, as well as be able to hold my weight. (115kg). I'm seriously out of shape and want to start 30-1hour sessions each day on it.

The other issue I have is my location. I live in Sweden and finding one here via websites is somewhat tricky. The best ones so far that I have seen are on amazon, but usually dont ship to Sweden or add an extremely hefty shipping cost ontop, roughly £100ish.

Exercise,Exercise,"r/Exercise, an activity requiring physical effort, carried out to sustain or improve health and fitness.

Just a reminder for a lot of people what that means. In that category, there are a lot of things to be found that is exercise, **exercise is not** just lifting heavy weights and working on aesthetics.

If you're moving and your heart rate is above your resting heart rate, you're exercising. 

Not every exercise is suitable or safe for every person at a certain stage, each and every exercise requires progression, education, and learning.

If you don't understand it, don't bash it, ask meaningful questions that will provide meaningful answers, which in turn help educate.

Flows are very much misunderstood, especially ***kettlebell flows***, people think they are just to look cool, they are dangerous, people think they have no benefits, but it's the complete opposite. They can:

* Raise the heart rate
* Improve cardiovascular endurance
* Improve muscular endurance
* Increase flexibility
* Increase core strength
* Improve proprioception

And the list goes on.

In effect, increase overall athleticism. Beside aesthetics there are things more important for certain people, things like, being able to:

* Last
* React fast
* React accurately
* Sprint
* Pull objects from all planes of motion
* Resist injury better

And the list goes on, **but above all, have fun**, to be able to stick with something for life, it has to be fun.",cavemankettlebells,self.Exercise,1579420720

I usually spend 2 hours for adequate rest between sets. He said long workouts release cortisol and eat from the muscle. But then i googled it and it said cortisol mainly spikes with long rest periods and high intensity. So say we scale down the intensity a bit so a typical 45min to 1 hour workout with supersets and dropsets and all and 40 s rest between sets like he said. Would that produce more or less cortisol than more volume and more rest. I rest about 2 mins between sets. Sometimes less sometimes more.,Alitravels,self.Exercise,1579349693

Wednesday - Cycling sprints 
Friday - Stairmaster intervals.

Exercise,I strongly recommend adding Thai massages into your routine.,"First off, no this isn’t some kind of justification for a happy ending. Saying massage is synonymous with happy endings is like saying a car wash place is synonymous with selling drugs. So trolls go find somewhere else. 

Also I don’t recommend doing this if you’re pregnant, have arthritis or have some chronic condition that can be worsened by any sort of massage. 

For everyone else especially people who work out, Why Thai massage? 
(1) unlike regular massage, Thai massage involve stretches for different parts of your back, your obliques, and your quads that Swedish massage doesn’t cover. Be warned: this can sometimes hurt a little but that’s part of it. If it hurts too much, you should communicate that to your masseuse. 

(2) it’s a foam roller on steroids. Those masseuses get some knots on your body you couldn’t have caught by yourself simply foam rolling. The analogy is comparable to you cleaning your own home versus a professional cleanser cleaning your home.

(3) it shortens recovery time from various muscle workouts and is super useful to prevent injuries. 

(4) it increases your range of motion and flexibility. Well this is related to the third point. 



But be warned: after you get a Thai massage, drink at least a couple glasses of water.",nouseforaname888,self.Exercise,1579017135

Exercise,"Does exercising without weights for example, push-ups or crunches help gain anything?","As I’m a busy sophomore, everyday is wake up at 6:30 (I have 2 other siblings that wake up here too), get ready, leave at 7, drive to my grandma’s house, to get to busses. Bus picks up at 7:30, school starts at 8 am, ends at 3:10, get to grandma’s at 3:20. Eat til 4pm, drive home with siblings by 5:00. Practice instruments (viola, piano and electric guitar) for about 45 minutes each. End of practice about 7:20? Eat something after practice, still have time to do whatever.

That is my schedule for everyday except weekends and Wednesday’s, so I don’t think I have time to spend time to go out to the gym and workout with my buddies. So the question still remains unanswered, without weights, can I gain anything?

I signed up to the gym last week wanting to have a bit of a change in my life and I started eating a bit more. Alot more (around 2700 Cal)

I figured im not going to be committed enough to keep up preparing foods and counting calories all the time. So I agreed with myself not to worry about strictly looking at calories and to have a more balanced diet just work out 3 times a week. 

I know going to the gym regardless is better than what I'm doing atm which is nothing but  without a surplus of calories will my muscles get ""stronger""? I don't care what I look like I just want to feel better about myself and notice some sort of progression over the next year or so.

It's been around 5 years since I've ran suicides, and I'm not sure what the best distance should be. There's a HS football field down the road for me and I was thinking about setting up some cones tomorrow morning. I remember running different distances. What would be some good setups? I was thinking of starting off with the following setup:

1. 5 yards
2. 10 yards
3. 15 yards
4. 10 yards
5. 5 yards

Is that likely to yield a good workout? Too much? too little? 

I'm also interested in practicing going from sprints to changing direction, varying directions (not just turning 180°) and running back. If I set up an ""M"" formation, or something, would that help?

I'm probably about 53kg (about 110lbs for all you americans) and 5""6/5""7. I have quite a high metabolism. 
I have something going on in 3 weeks that it's important to me that i would like to see some difference by then, particularly to my butt. 
I'm not very good at engaging my glutes, I'm pretty sure the way i walk and my posture doesn't activate them at all tbh.

I've got some protein powder and I'm going to make sure I eat enough food to prevent any muscle degradation, and to make sure I get enough protein to actually build the muscle. 

I've looked online and it all seems to say it's not really possible to build muscle much very quickly as a woman. I have built muscle in the past from minimal exercise so I think if I go all out there could be some visible change.

3 sets of 10 situps
3 sets of 10 squats
3 sets of 10 bicycle kicks

Are there any other major exercises I should try to add? I can't do anything with much strain on my knees since I have an injury there. Any tips for making it easier on myself or ensuring I can keep at it day after day?

Also: I'm 4 days into my workout now and I find it's been Workout, rest, workout, easy workout. I really want to be able to do it daily without full break days. Is that feasible? I feel like I'm not doing that much in terms of exercise overall, even if it currently exhausts me.

Exercise,Is it normal to feel anxious when you can't work out?,"Hey, teenage girl here. I've been working out almost every day since late September 2019. I don't do much, and none of it is high intensity (mostly just jogging, biking, and switching off between arm/leg/core toning). I've definitely became healthier and way more fit, but nothing super impressive.

However, if I skip even a day of workout, I feel super claustrophobic, sick, trapped, and I start having small panic attacks. I can feel a lump in my throat and it's hard to fall asleep, because I'm thinking about the exercise that I didn't get that day. I can't function without being snappy and rude, and I feel guilty for eating anything that day. I also drink less water and I don't feel comfortable in any clothes that I have. I will literally cry if you make me wear anything other than shorts and a way oversized t-shirt/sweatshirt (not comfortable in sweats/jeans/leggings if I don't work out).

Is this normal? Should I be worried and tell my parents/doctor? Is there anything that describes what's happening to me, and can I do anything about it?

It's impossible to work out every single day because there are days that I have too much homework + after school activities + other plans, and I want to know if there's any way to make this less painful when it happens. Thank you in advance!",epic-napkin,self.Exercise,1578543540

So my question is: how do I start? I’ve never truly worked out, the small portion of my youth I ran on a treadmill I just ran till I was exhausted but now I really have to be careful with my back, and my job requires me to walk down move for 8 hours so I can stumble around with foal legs. So is there a time/distance I should start with? How do I ramp up a work out?

I tried keto which helped but isn't sustainable 

Now i eat high protein higher fat low - moderate carb 1600-1700cal a day. I should probably eat less but I'm afraid of absolutely ruining my metabolism again.

Exercise,Advice needed: jogging and weights,"Hello there

I’m 25 Male 168lbs (as of this morning)  5’9”. I think I’m average build. Can post a picture later if needed. 
I wanted to start running. I started intermittent fasting on order to better my health and also to shed some pounds and get some muscle on before going on vacation to Hawaii in 6 months. I started fasting back in December. 
Now, I know that I’m not going to get super shredded in this 6 month period, but some definition of muscle would be nice. 
Back to my question
How the heck do people start running?! I have an old treadmill with incline but have no idea on how to start without getting super dizzy or being in pain or feeling like I’m gonna hurl. 
I do eat before working out and wait for the food to digest a bit (3 hrs sometimes). 
I have an elliptical as well but I’ve heard running is better. 
Along with this
I own an Olympic bar with 300 lbs in weights and a dumbbell that goes up to 35 lbs. I don’t have a bench or anything of that sort. Just some mats that the weights sit on. 
My cousin gave them to me when he decided to move across the country and didn’t want to deal with the hassle of moving weights. 

Any advice on workouts and how to best utilize them without having to buy a bench and rack?

Ive tried knee pushups but doing them not only makes me feel bad about myself and I can only do about 5-8 of them.

I am a 32yo, very tall (187cm) female. I have a healthy weight that fluctuates between 77 and 80kg. 

I do have some health issues - right side torticollis at birth, corrected by surgery, obviously still struggling with a shortened muscle and tendons; torn right hip flexor, still pretty tight and sore; history of uterine cancer (under control).

I do a lot of walking and cycling, but I feel that I really need to build muscle to keep my big frame stable and strong. 

Not sure where to start from - can you guys please give some advice?

Thank you!!",communistwitch,self.Exercise,1578069417

Exercise,I need some advice,"I need some advice for something that probably has a really simple solution, that I probably already know the answer to. TLDR near the bottom

I want to exercise. I’m underweight to an unhealthy degree, I’ve struggled with gaining weight my whole life (I fluctuate between 95-100lbs), I have some medical issues that could benefit from me taking the time to workout and gain at least some weight, and I’m overall unhappy with my outward appearance which worsens my emotional and mental health. I have every reason to workout it feels like, but my biggest problem is that I can’t stick with it. I know I lack internal drive, and I can be incredibly lazy, and I definitely don’t believe in myself as much as I should. For whatever the reason may be, I can’t seem to fully commit to working out on a regular basis, and I’m sick of coming up with excuses for myself like, “school this,” or, “didn’t have time that,” or “I didn’t feel like it today.” I know that there is the “you just gotta do it” answer which is more than likely the only answer there really is, but I wanted to reach out for whatever help I can get.

TLDR: How do I stick with it? How do I find the motivation everyday to get up, exercise, and better myself?

Exercise,Does anyone else have way better workouts when high on marijuana?,"I know this may sound like somewhat of an oxymoron to most of you but please hear me out. 

I’ll start this off by saying that I also use pre workout and don’t go to the gym only high on marijuana. It started by just going to the gym with a friend or 2 and they would have the idea of smoking a little before going to the gym. At first I was like why would you do that but I gave it a shot anyways. Fast forward a few years I now have some of the best workouts while I’m high. The way it affects me, my pre workout provides me with the energy to workout and the weed provides me with this insane focus on my workout. I feel like nothing else matters other than my workout and because of that I am even sometimes able to lift more while high. 

Thinking and talking about this with my friends has led me to think: what if someone made a weed infused pre workout that got you a mild level of high just enough to have more of a focus on their workout? I know everyone reacts to substances differently and most people should not be high at the gym for a multitude of reasons. Obviously it’s a horrible idea to release a marijuana infused pre workout to the public but I like to entertain the thought. Thoughts?

Exercise,Question about Heart Rate,"When I'm on a treadmill my heart rate is easily in the 180's+ for the duration of the exercise. I can 'easily' run 6-7mph for 45-60 minutes and if I ever grip the heart monitor things my heartbeat is usually 185-190 almost without deviation. I would assume faulty equipment at the gym or inaccurate sensors but I've done this across dozens of treadmills, and over the years of moving, and thus changing gyms, it never really changes. I was in the army for several years and so I had assumed this was just a normal exercising heart rate because the only way I could keep my heart below that, in the 'fat burning zone' or the 'aerobic zone' requires me to basically walk.

This being said, I can run for several miles while my heart is at this pace, which apparently is surprising due to the fact I've recently learned that I should be spending a minimal amount of time in the 80-90% bpm range. 

So I guess what I am getting at is: should I be concerned? I had asthma as a child but as I've grown more fit I suffer fewer and fewer symptoms. I would figure that by now I should have a much lower heart rate than this, though I've never actually bought a personal heart rate monitor to test to see if maybe it's just something about my palms that give false readings?",LeoniteCross,self.Exercise,1577358396

Exercise,Flat big ass and big legs. Looking for tips,"Hi guys.

All my life I have had a big bottom body compared to my upper body. My legs and my glutes were so big before I started doing exercise (I have been training for about half a year, every weekday and a good alimentation.

I'm 18 years old, and my height is 5.5 ft (1'70 cms), my hips are 41 (106 cms) inches and my legs are approximately 23 inches (57 cms). My weight before starting lifting was 163 pounds (74 kg), now 4 months qlater is 171 pounds (78 kg).
I train every part of my body, but I don't practice often any specific exercise for glutes.

Compared to now, I'm a lot stronger and my upper body got sooo much better than before, but in my bottom body my legs grew a lot but I think my glutes aren't at the proportion of my legs, they look smaller than my legs, even before they were bigger than my legs.

In my training I include deadlifts, squats, lunges, hip thrusts and donkey kicks.

I would like my glutes to look bigger than my legs, and more rounded, but i don't know if my no progession is because I'm a bit fatty because I'm bulking (as clean as I can), or a mistake with my bottom body training

Actually my glutes are big, but they are likely flat, and they're not rounded or pretty. I would like my glutes to see round as many males in the internet.

I would appreciate any tip you could say to me",santixz1402,self.Exercise,1577240198

Exercise,Benefits vs drawbacks of working down the weight stack,"I’ve returned to the gym recently after taking some time off because of a weird work schedule. Coming back, I started doing something different. 

I start my workout (after cardio) with either dumbbell chest press or seated bicep curls at 25 lbs. This time though, after completing three sets, I didn’t move to another exercise, I just picked up the 20 lbs. weights and went again, and kept going down the line like that. 

I started doing that with the machines I’m using as well. The only definite downside I can see is that I’m spending less time using different machines or exercises per workout because it takes so much longer. I haven’t been doing it long enough to see if it’s really getting easier or helping me build muscle, but it feels like I’m working the muscles to the point of exhaustion. 

Does anyone know if I’m being less or more efficient or have any warnings/hazards to watch out for if I continue doing this?",nunciative,self.Exercise,1577225167

My goal is to be active every day (with a rest day or a day of low intensity exercise) and to build and tone muscle in both my upper and lower body as well as increase the size of my buttocks. I think diet might be the hardest thing. My daily caloric intake is pretty low and I think that might be contributing to a slower gain (if not, a loss) in muscle mass. I always get nervous about consuming too many calories and going back to the weight I used to be. I need a structured diet plan or ideas of foods that could help contribute to toning my body while making my butt bigger. Any advice about diet or my exercise routine is extremely appreciated.

Exercise,How do you actually stay motivated to exercise?,"I am 30, nearly 40, pounds overweight.
One big problem is that even though I am, I dont look like it. You can definitely tell I'm overweight if I have my shirt off but other than that I look semi in shape. Because of this I dont really get upset about my looks enough to keep my motivated, no one comments on it either. Since I have none of this I do a lot of the ""I'll do it later."", ""One day doesnt matter."", ""Maybe tomorrow.""
But that later or tomorrow never comes. I simply do a little bit of weights when feeling insecure and that's it, not a bunch of weight exercises either, just arm workouts. How do you make yourself motivated to stick to it, and not just brush  it off? It takes so long to actually see results. So how do I actually stay motivated LONG ENOUGH to see the results?",ImNotAPervertISwear,self.Exercise,1576484044
Exercise,Do you have to exercise every day to see results? What about 3-4 days/week?! Is that good enough to get the benefits?,"I’m on a new work schedule. I work part time (Mon, Weds and Fri). On those days I work 8-5 and I don’t feel comfortable yet waking up super early to workout. Last time I tried working out early, I felt horrible, so I think I need to ease into the early AM workouts. When I get home at night, I’m honestly too exhausted to do anything so I don’t push myself. Right now, I exercise on the days I’m off work (Tues + Thurs) and then again Saturday and occasionally Sunday, if I feel up to it. So, it ends up being about 3 days of exercise with the occasional 4. 

Earlier this year and during the summer time I was working out Mon-Fri. My schedule was also much more open and flexible. I’ve definitely slacked a little bit since then. I think the colder weather and shorter days has a big time effect on my motivation. I still stay active just not as intensely. 

Even still, I’m very dedicated to getting movement in each week, even if it’s just 3 days. I’m not trying to push myself too hard because I’m going through a difficult “phase of life” right now. I’ve been exercising for a couple years now, so it’s kind of embedded in my brain at this point. It’s important to me, I’m just not pushing myself as hard as I could be, I guess. 

Even if I don’t get a workout in, I love staying active in anyway I can. Even if it’s just a long walk around the town on a Saturday/Sunday with my fam. Or a hike. I love to move my body.",takeaabreath,self.Exercise,1576461285

Exercise,My thoughts on some of the biggest benefits to be aware of when starting a fitness journey to help you keep track of progress,"I'm pretty keen on exercise and while not the most athletic, I have seen some incredible benefits from regularly exercising (30 minutes a day) to maintain my health, both physical and mental. I really wanted to share this because I hope it inspires people who are thinking of beginning, and how it can truly transform significant aspects of their lives.

Here's a video detailing some of the benefits if you prefer to watch, but I've also written my findings below for those who prefer reading (I've bulleted it to make it easier to read): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dmZWAX7da8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dmZWAX7da8)

**Weight Loss**

\- The most obvious and common reason people normally exercise, it helps to lose weight and burn fat in the body

\- Your body spends energy in 3 ways, digesting food, exercising and maintaining body functions done by vital organs like the heart

\- While dieting can aid weight loss, it slows your metabolic rate, unlike exercise, which increases it and will in turn burn more calories and help you lose weight more effectively

**Makes You Happier**

\- Exercise has been found to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety and stress

\- This is because it produces changes in the brain by releasing hormones to help regulate stress and anxiety, and relieve feelings of depression

\- It also releases endorphins, which make you feel good and make you feel happier as a result

\- The amazing thing is, you don't need to do an intense workout for the effects, but just being active can help make you happier

**Increases Energy Levels**

\- It might seem contradictory, but exercise actually increases your energy levels through the day

\- Studies have shown that six weeks of regular exercise reduced the feelings of fatigue of 36 people who had reported persistent fatigue

\- Doing regular exercise has been shown to be more effective in combating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), than passive therapies such as relaxation or stretching

\- In addition, exercise has been shown to increase energy levels in people suffering from progressive illnesses, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis

**Help Skin Health**

\- Your skin can be affected by the amount of oxidative stress in your body, which occurs when the body's antioxidant defenses cannot completely repair the damage that free radicals cause to cells

\- While intense and exhaustive exercise can contribute to oxidative damage, regular moderate exercise can increase your body's production of natural antioxidants

\- This means exercise can stimulate blood flow and induce skin cell adaptations that can help delay the appearance of skin aging

\- Meaning to get healthy and glowing skin naturally, regularly do a light daily workout

**Improve Brain Function and Memory**

\- Regular exercise can improve brain function and help memory and thinking skills, as it increases your heart rate it promotes the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain, helping it function more effectively

\- In addition to this, it can also stimulate the production of hormones that can enhance the growth of brain cells and exercise has been shown to grow the hippocampus, which is a part of the brain that's vital for memory and learning

I tried it today, doing pull, and it honestly wasn’t the best workout. I ended up doing a ton of deadlifts. But I wasn’t even doing them right because someone told me when I go to pick up the bar, my first instinct to to pop up my butt and lift. Like I’m not squatting deep enough or keeping my back.

I used to think that it was okay, or rather that I am blessed because I can eat whatever I want and not gain weight (thank god for fast metabolism, right?) I think I am what most girls would consider lucky, but now that I’m older, more mature, I began to question more things about myself. I formed a habit of eating unhealthily, having the luxury to not really mind what I ate since I wasn’t gaining weight anyways. But I realised in the long run, all these unhealthy choices are going to haunt me. 

I hate this lifestyle, and have decided that I am going to make a conscious decision to get my lazy ass moving for a sake of a healthier lifestyle and not suffer when I’m 80 and on the verge of death. I want to start exercising and eating healthily now that I am done with exams and have more time on my hand.

Exercise,Need help convincing my fiance to exercise more,"After typing this I realized this became more of a rant and venting of my frustrations, I love this woman to pieces but the lack of drive (influenced by he depression most likely) is hard to deal with, without me becoming the bad guy who is uncaring or demanding or pushing her too hard. I want her to enjoy exercise, and she absolutely does enjoy it when we workout together but getting her off the couch is the hard part, she almost always feels great after working out. 

Let me clarify, she sees a personal trainer two times a week and he definitely works her out but she never does her 'homework' routines. Shes about 260 and suffer's from anxiety and depression. She's never missed a session with her trainer, even on the nights she's not feeling 100% (Probably has a lot to do with that her trainer is my best friend from high school and we see him every saturday for DnD/Game/Movie night and he's a bit of an ass lol)  


With the rare exception of her working out with my friend, I cannot influence her to workout otherwise. If she's feeling good and is motivated that day then we will go for a walk or hit up the gym together or do her homework routine together, but if she's not feeling 100% it's like threading a needle while being far sighted.

The plus side to this is that she is a dog walker, a business we started two years ago and now have a stream of daily clients, Monday and Tuesday being her busiest where she conducts up to three 30min walks, with Thursday and Friday there usually are only one.

All-in-all I would normally say that walking for an hour, the daily average, plus two days of intense exercise would be enough but it just seems like it isn't, mostly from a CICO perspective.

Before she started to train with my friend she got down to an all-time low of 214, down from 260 her previous (and current) high while doing a strict Keto diet (&lt;20g carbs per day) Her trainer said that the year or so it took to get her from 260 to 214, eating sometimes less than 1000 calories a day, likely damaged her metabolism and so she had to start eating 2200 calories (Believe it or not, eating enough is sometimes as hard as eating too little) and to drop Keto which made her weight shoot back up in the 6 months they've been training. (Admittedly she's gained a ton of muscle in that time as well, she's definitely not as flabby as she once was especially in her thigh's.)  Recently he's been dialing her back week by week until we hit last week's new count of 1800

I know I may be sounding unreasonable when I want/demand she workout more than she already does but if she's not walking dogs she's on the couch watching youtube or playing video games. I know working out is &lt;40% of the equation but  this isn't the forum for dieting lol. (The biggest problem there is portion control and staying consistent. Not necessarily craving sweets but can't stop unless the plate is empty, only sometimes weighing/measuring food.)

Then there is scheduling issues. We can't really set a dedicated time that we will not compromise on for gym hours, first our gym is only open til 9pm, otherwise that would probably increase our workouts by at least 3-4 per month. (We often have meet and greet's for clients in the late afternoon/evening when people get off work, plus we have a semi-regular client that is a graveyard shift nurse that we walk/feed/potty around 10)

But if convincing her to go to the gym on the rare free evening is nothing compared to the actual outright hostility I get if I try to wake her up any earlier than I already do. (I get up at 7am for classes, even on the days my classes are at 11 just for the consistency.) Trying to get her up at 6, when she doesn't have to get up until 11 most days anyway is a nightmare. (She has at least gotten into the routine of getting up with me at 7, though she absolutely goes right back to sleep, more often than not even if it's just on the couch, as soon as I'm out the door around 8:45. And if you're wondering why I get up an hour and a half before going to school? While I wake up like a bolt of lightning, I still like to take my mornings slow.)

I have been with this woman for seven years at this point and I am still deeply in love with her, this has little to do with physical attraction, she was as big or bigger when I first started dating her, but as someone who loves fitness and her constant worries about her appearance, worries about death (she get's so anxious about it she refuses to talk about death) I just can't find the right combination of pushing her and not being an unempathetic asshat.

Anyways... I'm ranting and being nitpicky at this point.

Exercise,Shocked by the effects of not exercising after not missing more than 2 days over the past 4 years.,"Sorry for the long post, but exercise and our bodies fascinate me and I like to write about it!

I am currently a senior who is about to graduate from University in May. Like I said in the title I have not missed more than 2 days of exercise over the past 4 years (since I started school) until this past week. 

I have made it a priority to get 60 min of quality and intense bodyweight/weight lifting/cardio exercise every day. Understanding the type of stress and recovery my body needs with that, I have consistently made it a huge focal point to have quality sleep, active recovery, and nutrition to assist my body in doing so. These changes had allowed me to fall in love with all forms of exercise and assisted me in losing 50lbs. 

Unfortenuley, two weeks ago when I was working out I was lifting more heavy than usual, I compromised my form and paid for it by having my first exercise-related injury and slipping a disc in my back. This was a huge blow to me, not only to my ego, but my way of life that had become over the past 4 years. My physician said because this is a lower back injury, and Id like to exercise as soon as I could, it would be best to rest for 1-2 weeks then come back slow. Of course, I listened and have done all the at-home rehab and rested so far for the past 2 weeks.

Exercising and keeping my body in a healthy check over the past 4 years have also allowed me to build a strong mind to body connection and have really noticed some huge changes in my mental and physical state that I believe is from taking a break from exercise. These types of things fascinate me, So id thought Id share!

**Mental Changes:** Heavier lack of motivation to do school work and job, around 5pm every day I feel more fogged and drained from the day than usual,  lack of sex drive, negative thoughts linger for longer periods of time. 

**Physical Changes:** Physically more bloated and inflamed gut after any meal, sleep has been restless and consistently feel exhausted in the morning, lack of sex drive can go here too lol and my body even feels sore in the morning even though I'm not working out. 

I am not worried about these symptoms as my fiancee is in the exercise profession and can attest to these symptoms have connections to my situation. As I get back into more easy and slow exercise I will keep these changes in mind to make sure they are exercise-related. I am in no way an exercise professional or study the body, just one of my loves and hobbies, feel free to comment your thoughts or questions, I love to talk about this and hear other perspectives! 

If you are still reading, thanks for following along! Exercise is a beautiful thing and our bodies are absolutely made to move, move, move! Have an awesome rest of your week and hit those goals...exercise and **life**\-related!

Exercise,Why muscles are feeling sore after exercise?,"**Regardless of whether you are packing in some very late exercise before the special seasons or attempting another exercise, be careful with throbbing muscles. Be that as it may, for what reason does your body feel so sore, and what would you be able to do to accelerate recuperation?**

Have you chosen to make a beginning on your New Year’s goals and take up practice now? Or on the other hand possibly you’re taking a gander at venturing up your standard daily practice in front of the unavoidable overabundances of the special seasons? The odds are that your muscles will follow through on the cost.

Beginning inside a day of your activity session, your muscles start to seize up, and you feel increasingly awkward. For the following couple of days, you move like a robot, think that its difficult to dress yourself, and the straightforward demonstration of strolling down a lot of stairs will see you moaning in misery.

Regardless of whether you have as of late taken up practice or truly pushed your points of confinement, you likely could be acquainted with this grouping of occasions.

You are encountering the joys of deferred beginning muscle irritation (DOMS). In any case, what causes the agony, and is there anything you can do to stop it? We present to you the logical proof.

## DOMS and offbeat exercise

DOMS is the sign of offbeat exercise. This is any activity that makes a muscle protract while it is under pressure. Instances of erratic exercise are running (especially downhill), the bringing down development of a bicep twist, and the descending period of a squat.

At the point when we perform whimsical activities that our bodies aren’t yet used to, we cause harm to our muscles.

Writing in the journal Sports Medicine, Patricia Hume, Ph.D. — a teacher of human execution in the School of Sport and Recreation at Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand — clarifies that “DOMS is named a sort I muscle strain damage.”

However, what causes the muscle harm and the agony?

## Numerous speculations, few many answers

Tragically, no one truly realizes what causes DOMS, in spite of the way that there are a few logical hypotheses. Prof. Hume believes it’s a blend of the numerous hypotheses out there.

To start with, the powers created during the capricious development harm the muscle structure and the encompassing connective tissue. This causes an unevenness of calcium, which prompts further harm.

Next, aggravation kicks in. This invigorates torment nerves inside the space of 48 hours and is joined by expanding, which exacerbates the agony.

Whatever the reason, the torment is genuine and can be crippling. All in all, what would you be able to do?

## Cryotherapy and Antioxidants

Huge numbers of the speculations about DOMS point the finger soundly at unreasonable free radicals and oxidative harm produced during unconventional work out.

Truth be told, we revealed not long ago that an ongoing report in the diary Science Signaling found that free radicals might be fundamental for muscle fix.

CryotherapyTrusted Source is a go-to post-practice treatment for some individuals. Be it applying cold packs or the more advanced type of entire body cryotherapy — as of late experienced by individuals from the Medical News Today publication group — there is no proof that cryotherapy can assist you with recovering from DOMS.

## How can you beat DOMS?

Rather, you could get yourself a back rub, which — as indicated by an orderly audit distributed this September in the diary Frontiers in Physiology — might mitigate your torment, particularly when applied 48 hours post-exercise.

For a DIY arrangement, proof is mounting that froth roller back rubs can adequately lessen your torment.

A few littler examinations out this year propose wearing pressure garments after your exercise and expending milk protein to accelerate your recuperation.

Fortunately DOMS will clear up without anyone else in the event that you give your body enough rest. While you may be enduring the upsetting impacts as you read this, have confidence that your next exercise will be less agonizing.

Thanks.

I start to lose weight 1 month ago so I go to gym at least once per week under the guidance of my PT, after each intense workout, my coach would help me do some stretching and massaging, he told me that could relief my muscles and I will feel better in the following days.

He uses the electric massage machine and it vibrates at a very fast speed to massage my legs and back, and then he will also use the manual massage stick to help relief my muscles, and it really works, in the next day or following day, I can’t feel the muscle that hurt, and I can totally bear it.

Electric one is too expensive, so I bought a manual stick from Amazon, below pictures for your reference.

**Why**: Endless crunches put weight on your spine and, when done erroneously, can give you a lot of odd, widened abs. Boards are ideal for working your center such that keeps you damage free and assembles the level six-pack you’re after.

Gradually lower your body by flexing at the elbows until your arm at lower arm make a 90 degree edge. Utilizing your triceps lift yourself back to the beginning position.

**Why**: This is anything but difficult to do on a seat, stair or end table. It works the arms, chest and bears and is extraordinary on the off chance that you need individuals to see that you’ve begun working out as it fabricates triceps successfully.

**The most effective method to do it**: Lie level on your back with your knees bowed at a 90-degree edge. Spot your hands on either side of your head. Drive your lower again into the floor as you lift your shoulders a couple of crawls off the floor – ensure your lower back remains in contact with the ground consistently. Tense your abs hard at the best purpose of the development, at that point return leveled out to the begin position.

**Why**: The principal port of require any abs exercise this is an absolute necessity do. By lifting your legs you place additional load on the stomach muscles and lessen the energy that could make this less demanding.

They both suggested instead that I do something to come down from the run like stretches or a cold shower.

I thought this was a bit odd at first because I hadn’t heard about doing something after a run before, just what to do beforehand and during but it could make sense? I’m just not really sure.

I thought I’d ask what everyone else thought of this, is this something I should do? Would it help me be less sore in the following days? I also heard just having a nap after a workout is good because it helps muscle tissue heal but I’m no expert, just trying to find something about it online.

Exercise,I cant keep with an exercise routine because of injuries.,"I try to do body weight exercises, some light lifting, and running and have had trouble sticking with all three. 

My problem with the lifting and pushups is that I have tennis elbow in both elbows. I literally can throw up 150 pounds with no problem on the bench but instantly my elbows make a loud pop and they will hurt for 3-4 days with crazy inflammation that feels like there is air trying to escape from them. I've tried taking a 4 month break from lifting and going back because my elbows weren't hurting everyday anymore and sure enough I just reopened the wound so to speak. I initially hurt them while lifting a very heavy piece of machinery and had I let it go, it would have killed someone. That was 2 years ago and I've had this problem ever since. 

The shitty thing is, my knees are the same way. I was running everyday and got to the point where I could run a 5k without stopping (before starting my routine I had never ran more than half a mile in my life and surely not without coughing and choking till I was oxygen deprived). But one day I was running downhill and one after another both of my knees went out. I guess I was putting too much pressure on them. They made the signature loud pop noise and for an instant there was unbearable pain. After that they just felt swollen and now they do the same thing my elbows do, just when I start running. So I've switched to trying to diet to lose weight but I'm failing. I lost 100 pounds on atkins but I cant do it anymore as I get the keto flu the entire duration of ketosis and start to feel like I'm dying no matter what I supplement. I'm still about 20 pounds overweight and I'm 25% body fat when I'm supposed to br like 14% according to health experts. 

I'm only 20 years old and I feel like my body is ruined. I'm in pain almost all the time and I can feel referred pains that shoot down my arms and legs. Not to mention my neck is super messed up and has been for about 5 years. It constantly aches and I have to spend a combined total of an hour daily stretching it or it spasms and sometimes gets stiff. 

I'm still running which kills my knees but I just dont want to sit around all day. Because of my depression I have to exercise or I will get angry or even suicidal. But all of these pains just make it that much more difficult",PhrygianNoodles,self.Exercise,1573849458

Exercise,The Most Best Lower Back Exercises at Home - Vitra Range," 

If you wish to do lower back exercises at home you must isolate several muscles and have to know more details about anatomy.

Do you know that lower back muscles need more specialized exercises to isolate more than exercises like deadlift.

You need to have stronger lower back muscles because it can protect your spine from injuries and also carry over into body movements just like squat and deadlift who require lower back strength.

If you used to do lower back exercises at home you are allow to extend and rotate your spline.

The extending spine is just like the way that arching it. That is doing opposite motion of rounding your back muscles.

Then your lower back muscles are working when you arch your back muscles.  
Good lower back exercises at home  
If you wish to do lower back exercises at home you think it is too much hard because you haven’t equipment and space.

It is not true. If you have enough space to lay down you can do lower back exercises at home easily.

But you need to find some soft thing to lay down while you doing supermans and prone back extensions.

If you willing to do deadlift you need something light to pick up just like heavy box or something filled with heavy thing.

Exercise,lower back / coccyx pain after jump-rope,"Hey all,

I basically do zero exercise, so i decided to pick up a jump-rope last night to get some workout done at home.

immediately after trying it (like within the first 2 seconds / 3 jumps, noticed it was it was painful/ putting stress on my lower back.. like lower lower back / very bottom of spine. Not sure if its my coccyx or spine.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized i was jumping on the tips of my toes, so i tried using the balls of my feet and making an effort to have my back and legs as straight as possible. I was also barefoot and jumping on a carpeted floor. after switching to balls of feet and straightening back, it seemed to be a bit better, but only sometimes. Other times i still feel the stress on lower back. Tried putting on some casual sneakers, but pretty much same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips as to what I'm doing wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

some additional info:

I do really tiny hops, to where my feet barely leave the ground, so i doubt its the jump height. I'm barely over 6' tall, jump rope is 9'. i read the rope should reach armpits while standing on it, though its just short of that length. I try to keep my hands around hip height, using pretty much just my wrists to get the rope going. 

Also didn't really do any kind of warmup or stretch before, though im not sure how the usual warmups would help with the stress on that region of the lower back. I also remember a couple of years ago when i tried doing some other home exercises, I think planks or pushups sometimes gave pain in that area, and I think I had read that it was due to lack of core strength. If so, could that somehow be part of the issue here as well? (Sorry - I'm clueless with anatomy and exercise)",UFAQs,self.Exercise,1573281004

Exercise,Interested in working with a personal trainer? This consultation guide might help you pick a great one.,"The following excerpt is taken from my full guide, [Finding the Best Personal Trainer](https://fitstra.com/finding-the-best-personal-trainer/). The other sections of the guide cover how to evaluate your needs, schedule consultations, and other important info leading up to the first meeting. This section dives into what to look for in a trainer when you finally sit down and chat about your goals, lifestyle, and expectations.

Hope it helps!

&amp;#x200B;

**Interviewing the Trainer (Consultation)**

An effective consultation simultaneously accomplishes two things – it allows a client to assess a trainer’s competency and personality compatibility and it also provides the fitness pro with an opportunity to properly evaluate a client’s goals, baseline movement abilities, training preferences, and injury limitations. This meeting is valuable to clients interested in researching a service but it’s critical to a trainer’s ability to effectively design an individualized program and should be taken seriously.

While you are ultimately basing a purchase on your perception of another’s level of proficiency, it’s incredibly important that from the onset of the meeting you are genuinely seeking a real conversation and not fixated on interrogating an unsuspecting victim – that’s not fun for anyone.  When judging another person for any job related reason, it can be easy to slowly become standoffish and less open as you analyze their responses. Avoid that. Be human, attentive, and honest. Treat the consult as if your success depends on how effectively you communicate and listen to ideas. Your final decision will be much easier if you put real effort into connecting with and learning about the person on the other side of the table.

With that said, there are garbage trainers out there and you need to know how to spot them. Let’s talk about a few major red flags to watch for during the consultation process and some points of general advice for the meeting.

A good personal trainer follows a basic consultation template that typically includes a goals/lifestyle/limitations questionnaire, measurements of height/weight/body composition, and a very basic assessment of physical capabilities. Great trainers will take this monotonous process of discovery and turn it into an enjoyable experience where organic, flowing conversation masks the formulaic structure of the interview. There are endless ways to evaluate the needs and baseline abilities of a client but some form of investigation is absolutely necessary. Along with the obvious safety issues created by skipping this step, failing to establish a starting point makes it impossible to gauge progress. If your trainer wants to begin the first meeting with an intense workout while having no knowledge of your limitations, have concerns.

Because your needs and preferences are the main focus points of this initial interaction, you should find yourself talking the majority of the time as you respond to direct and open ended questions. The trainer should be genuinely interested in your unique position as they inquire more about you. However, if you notice a greater emphasis is placed on the advertisement of products and services than on you, have concerns. In larger corporate and chain gyms, it’s common for consultations to be used primarily as sales delivery platforms. We all need to make a living in this industry but you want to work with an exercise professional whose high quality services are purchasable – not a pushy salesperson with a fitness certification. Great trainers passively influence a client’s decision to buy a product by showcasing value and demonstrating real knowledge. Persuasion isn’t required.

As the consult moves along, make sure that assessment curiosity goes both ways by asking plenty of your own questions. If increasing muscular size is your main focus, ask the trainer to outline a basic plan of attack and then dive into the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind their suggested programming. A smart and educated fitness pro will be able to answer all of your questions with straightforward explanations and use language that’s easy to follow. If your eyes glaze over due to complicated anatomical terms and metabolic processes you’ve never heard of, be concerned. Reciting textbook definitions of concepts often implies a lack of true comprehension or that someone’s trying to impress you with all the big words they just learned. Either way, not ideal. Meeting with an excellent trainer won’t give you with a PhD level grasp on exercise physiology in an hour, but you should be left with a simple understanding of the proposed program.

The topic of nutrition will inevitably arise as you cover the lifestyle portion of the consultation and is an incredibly important part of the session. Good trainers will make general dietary recommendations based on available research and the advice of trusted health organizations without attempting to give detailed meal plans or precise macronutrient quantities. Great trainers have extensive nutrition knowledge and make the same general intake recommendations, but will ultimately urge their clients to utilize the professional services of registered dietitians for all things food related. If your trainer refers to themselves as a ‘nutritionist,’ be slightly concerned. While comprehensive nutrition certifications do exist and there are plenty of knowledgeable trainers that have these credentials, anyone (in the US) can use the label Nutritionist to describe their dietary services with absolutely no minimum level of education or certification needed. Registered dietitians, on the other hand, must have at least a bachelor’s degree, are required to complete a dietetic internship program, and must pass a state regulated exam to obtain their license. Great personal trainers can teach you a lot about nutrition but will always acknowledge their credential limitations and recommend you seek out a dietitian for the best educational services on food, supplements, and nutrient deficiencies.

Along with being incredibly knowledgeable, your trainer should also be fit. This lifestyle and appearance requirement is necessary but probably not for the reasons you’re imagining. An overweight, weak, and deconditioned trainer with minimal personal exercise experience could design a really effective weight loss exercise program simply by studying available research and other popular programs. Exercise professionals don’t have to have perfect abs to help someone else sculpt theirs. However, a trainer that exercises intensely, sticks to a smart diet, and is consistent with their habits will have a level of empathy and insight far greater than that of someone who just understands concepts and theories. Too many trainers don’t practice what they preach and eventually lose an appreciation for the mental and physical effort clients are required to exert in order to be successful. Some days are fun and swell our bodies and egos with confidence while others absolutely suck. A great trainer knows the difference between hard work and punishment because they define each end of the spectrum daily in their own programming. With that said, don’t immediately assume that the person with the superhero physique is as smart as they are fit – genetics and worth ethic are far too often more significant contributing factors to someone’s appearance than exercise knowledge and smart program design. Look for a combination of smarts and strength. 

A thorough consultation will also include some form of a movement component. Simple exercises like bodyweight squats require a low level of effort but allow the trainer to gauge basic physical capabilities. A great trainer will typically explain the exercise you are about to perform, show you how it’s done, then ask you to copy. This Tell-Show-Do method of instruction should be easy to follow and accompanied by hands on form correction and verbal cues for movement. If you’re thrown into an exercise with minimal explanation and feel completely lost, that’s not a great sign – maybe you were just daydreaming. If you ask for clarification and are given the same unhelpful directions, have concerns. Not all exercises are easy to learn and perform well, but a great trainer will always be able to effectively communicate what they want you to do. If your teacher can’t teach, you’ve got a problem.

Unfortunately, evaluating program design and the overall effectiveness of a personal trainer’s plan will be difficult for anyone that isn’t already pretty knowledgeable in fitness. Goals focused on strength, hypertrophy, and weight loss have well established general methods, but details will vary from trainer to trainer, and that’s totally fine. If you’re working within the parameters of smart research based program design, there are plenty of ways to become fit. We would need to cover too many things here for you accurately assess if a proposed exercise plan was structured in a way that targeted your goals effectively. Instead, trust that if your trainer is well educated and has a record of client success, they’re most likely qualified to also help you. But if you want a second opinion on a program, shoot me an email. I’ll give you an unbiased opinion and help you make a smart decision.

Finally, don’t be pressured into a same day purchase and if possible, avoid contracts with a minimum required time commitment. Unless you’re meeting with the last trainer on your list who’s obviously the best choice, wait until you’ve had some time to consider your options before pulling the trigger. Do your best to distinguish between a persuasive sales pitch and a conversation with a great trainer who’s inspiring you to better yourself. They’ll both have you reaching for your wallet but there’s clearly a preferred option. Regarding contracts, only pay month to month if possible. It may cost a little more, but your power to cancel every 30 days puts extra pressure on the instructor to keep the quality high and consistent.

There are so many different characteristics and personality traits in good and bad personal trainers that it’s impossible to cover them all. Hopefully the few covered here will make it easier for you to separate the good from the bad. Keep in mind that training styles vary and the presence of one red flag isn’t necessarily a deal breaker, but be wary if they start to add up. Ultimately, the best trainer for you will be the one you believe to be most competent and get along with best. This final decision is subjective and has no real right answer. Use your best judgement but try not to overthink it. Trust your gut and continue taking its advice even if it disappears after a few months of hard work.

Contact your final pick to set up payment and a start date, and as before with the first round, let the others know you’ve decided to go with another option and thank them for their time.",SamStephens,self.Exercise,1573224228

The reason why I ask if it is the correct one is that there has been time when I take a piss and it's a normal stream them I use my muscle to force the stream to come out faster and sometimes that actually stops me from urinating too if I force it too hard.

Exercise,Using high amounts of sodium for energy/the blood pressure raising aspect,"Heya. I was thinking and reading about salt, and started wondering, can it be used as an exercise or energy supplement, and is there any research or first hand accounts of using it like that? I've noticed having a large amount of sodium at once gives me a huge boost in energy (say in a bowl of instant ramen) and theoretically the raised blood pressure could be good for lifting (I feel pumped after a lot of salt). You sweat a lot when working out and need lots of water, so you'd also offset your sodium loss from exertion and flush out excess. 

I'll test it more on my own with/in place of caffeine but has anyone else tried using large amounts of sodium for the energy boost? Most of the effects from a large intake of sodium would be comparable to caffeine, I believe; nervous system stimulation, raised blood pressure, it can't block adenosine like caffeine but if you get enough sleep, caffeine has nothing to block. 

Lack of sodium also causes cramping (I've realized lately my cramping issues are due to having like, sub-1000mg a day of sodium) and having a bunch beforehand could also help a bunch with running or just avoiding cramps. 

I wonder if there are 1-2000mg sodium pills I could try. Probably! Also from reading about salt apparently nowadays they're saying more is better anyway - less than 3000 a day is linked to more health issues. I bet a high dose of caffeine (3-400mg) and 1-2000mg of sodium would be super energizing, as well as probably being very unhealthy.

Exercise,I let myself get out of shape and I'm so ashamed.,"TL;DR - I'm 47 and I've gained 60 lbs in the past year after neglecting my exercise and diet and now I'm afraid that this is it for me and I'll never be fit again. Need some perspective and encouragement.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I guess the title says it all.

I'm 47 and, up until a year ago, I was fairly fit. I wasn't running marathons or anything, but I was hitting the gym regularly, doing 30 minutes of elliptical on top of 30-45 minutes of weight training, and while I wasn't at my ideal weight, I had energy and I was motivated to keep going.

Then... I had some family issues come up. My mom was diagnosed with end-stage cancer and I focused my time and energy on caring for her in her last days. During this time, I stopped working out and took up stress-induced junk food binges, which led to me gaining weight. After she died, I was left to help care for my father, who has a lot of health issues and requires a lot of care and effort. He is wheelchair bound, mostly deaf, is losing cognitive functionality and has ongoing appointments with multiple specialists. I'm responsible for taking him to appointments, making sure his meds are filled and his bills are paid, along with any legal/banking issues. All of this, on top of my career, led me to basically decide that exercise and eating right didn't matter anymore. As a result, I gained even more wight and have gotten weaker.

I'm trying to pull myself out of the cycle and get back in the game, but I'm so ashamed at how far I've fallen. I see people at the gym who are doing what I used to do, and even more, and I fear that they are silently judging me for my weakness. My hips and thighs hurt from the weight gain... I've lost some flexibility and don't move as fast as I once did... and I'm trying to get it back but every time I see these fit, energetic, flexible people I get embarrassed and want to run out the door. I force myself to stay and do what I can do, but it's so much less than what I once did. 

Just last week, I attempted to do a basic combination exercise routine with light free weights (10 lbs total) and I was so sore that evening that I couldn't sleep. Now I'm scaling back to stationary bike, walking, and shorter, lighter weight routines... but damn, it's so sad when I realize that I'm getting winded over what was once a warmup. 

I'm just about ready to give up again. I don't want to do that. Please help me see the light in this... I have this deep seated fear that this pain, fatigue and stiffness is permanent and I'll never be fit again no matter what I do :(",bad_thrower,self.Exercise,1572622238

I am working on making a playlist I can listen to that has upbeat music so I can run with more motivation. I am not sure why but up beat music makes me run longer sometimes. I've noticed that the more upbeat the more I run. I would like to start my playlist with songs that are on the ""slow"" side and build up as they progress. For example I would not like a song that is super upbeat when I first start running but one that is moderately upbeat instead. Here is a list of some of the songs I have so far: 

""Blow My Whistle"" by Dj Aligator [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkfcNaaICE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkfcNaaICE4)

""No Gravity"" by East End - I can't find the song on line but it is on Spotify 

""Tainted Love"" by East End - I can't find this song but it is on Spotify.

I like beats like this and would like to know if you know of any songs like this, and if you could share them with me? Thank you. It would be nice if the songs are available on Spotify. This is what I use to stream music. Thank you.",bananapancakes2019,self.Exercise,1572614373

I am considering signing up for some personal training lessons.  I did some CrossFit, and while it was good (I saw some gains), it seemed quite haphazard.  I was thinking personal training can help me focus on my goals.  However, instead of doing an 1-hour long session 3 times a week, I am thinking of doing 30-min sessions 6 times a week.  I've heard that 30 mins is sufficient for gains, and that so long as I focus on different muscles groups for 2 consecutive days (giving each muscle group 48 hours to rest/recover), that's a better approach.  I wanna get the thoughts of any experienced people on this, and also if you have any advice for me (things to do or not to do, or to look out for, in personal training).",pyramix,self.Exercise,1572409392

Exercise,Strengthening grip and forearms,"So a little backstory: radial tunnel syndrome in both arms (diagnosed by an elbow specialist), rested for 1 year (really wish I hadn’t) then discovered a chiro that focused on stretching, nerve glides and and something called Graston. After doing this for a month or two I did PT and was sent on my way. I am **WAY** better than where I was 2 years ago, but I want to strengthen everything to see if I can get total relief.

In PT, he had me use a TheraBand Flexbar to do isometric exercises (mainly just twisting like I’m wringing out a towel but holding that position). I didn’t keep up with the bar like I should have so now my options are isometrics on it again or using an adjustable grip strengthener. My grip strength and forearms are really weak, 10 lbs on the grip strengthener is actually kinda tough right now.

TL;DR - Looking to improve strength in my hands/forearms, not looking to gain mass. Isometrics or grip strengthener? Which would be the better route or will they both give roughly the same results?",Altact27,self.Exercise,1571860454

Exercise,Correcting muscle imbalance that leads to recurring injury,"So a little backstory (sorry it's so long):

In 2012, I was serving in the Navy on an aircraft carrier. We were deployed, and I was working 13 hours a night (minimum), 7 nights a week for 8 months (no, I'm not exagerrating). Rarely seeing the sun and having almost no free time, and almost nothing to do when I did have free time, I needed something to blow off steam. The ship had 7 different gyms, so I started lifting. At 25 years old, this was the first time I had ever really tried weight training. I really got into it, and became especially motivated after I received a 'Dear John Letter' 6 months in and 2 months before coming home. 

The huge problem was that, being a young guy who was admittedly in it for the wrong reasons, I basically never did legs, aside from running on the treadmill for an hour, maybe a few times a week. Well, that really came back to bite me in the lower back when I was doing 360 lb shrugs on a hack squat machine. I started losing my grip, and rather than dropping the weight like I should have done, I bent over to set it down and *pop*. Massive strain, possibly a tear in my lower back on the right side (I believe it was my right spinal erector, but not positive). I went to medical and they gave me the same ol' schtick for everything: ""Take these 800 mg Motrin, ice it and drink plenty of water."" So I did, and after a few weeks I was (so I thought) back to normal.

Now I'm 33, and I have re-injured the same muscle roughly a dozen times over those 8 years, often while trying to strengthen my glutes and legs in an attempt to prevent this from happening again. I pretty much decided that deadlifts were out of the question for me. The last time it happened I had done a set of 10 squats,135 lbs, and was going for my second set. I got my shoulders under the bar and applied the slightest pressure and *pop*. That was about a year ago and I felt defeated, like it was never going to get better and I'm just stuck with this s****y lower back. I recently saw a video about Anterior Pelvic Tilt and it seemed like a good possibility that this was causing my injury. So I started trying yoga for the hips, low back and hamstrings, and started doing exercises like single-leg Ham/Glute bridges, leg lifts, hip abductions, lunges, squat jumps; all bodyweight, to be as gentle and gradual as possible and focus on form.

Yesterday I was doing pushups toward the end of my workout, and for the first time ever, I felt the left side tweak, just a little bit. Feels okay now but it scared the hell out of me, because all I was doing was bending down to do my last set of pushups. This shouldn't happen. I'm not an old man, but I'm starting to feel like my body is prematurely betraying me. I don't really know how to frame an actual question, I'm just looking for advice. Maybe I'm missing something vital.

Thanks in advance!",TheKivers,self.Exercise,1571684696

Exercise,Heart rate really high when running/exercising,"Bit of context:
Age: 25 years old
Gender: Male
Weight: 81.2kg 
BMI: 26 (just overweight), fast mass is 29.3%

I need advice for my really high heart rate. It may sound silly but I’m a bit of a beginner with exercise, I did play a bit of sport while younger then took at 10 year break :p then boom I’m 24, lazy and unfit.

So I started running about 8 months ago, I have a smart watch which tells me my heart rate and I see it slowly creeping up to 190 within 3 mins of running, I didn’t realise that was high at first so I kept running the same speed and distance for probably 5 months. (I run probably 2-3 times a week).

Anyways, My 32 minute 5k went down to a 30 minute 5k over a period of 8 months so I didn’t really improve much. I did slow down eventually and pace myself a bit better so that it would hit max 185 but anything lower then that I basically have to walk fast.

To top it off I was getting really bad shin splints for a while, went to a physio, did some exercises and slowed my pace down, it went away, came back. I couldn’t really go further then 5k without being exhausted or my legs really burning. I was recommended to work out my core.

Now my core is weaakk af, I can only plank for 20 seconds before I end up in a heap on the floor. My weight is a little on the high side. So I started doing the F45 challenge to improve my overall weight and fitness as well as diet. (For those of you don’t know what an F45 challenge is, it’s basically an 8 week challenge with 45 mins of high intensity workouts a number of times a week while eating a healthy protein, veggie rich diet in order to lose weight and gain muscle). 

I’m in week 2 at the moment, really struggling with the workouts. Again within 5 mins my heart rate jumps to 190+ doing basic exercises like pushups and squats. I end up having to stop so many times the trainer is always concerned, it’s also a little embarrassing.

Any advice to push this heart rate down would really help. Thanks :)",Kieran-H,self.Exercise,1571648105

Exercise,Benefits/risk of pushups with different shoulder positions.,"I am a climber and a beginning personal trainer and throughout my workouts i noticed an issue with holding my shoulder positions while climbing/lifting. I have been working on scapilar push/pull ups but ibwas looking for a new progression.

Being into calisthenics, i have noticed that for several movements (L sit, planche, levers etc.) Tend to have different optimal shoulder positions that I still have trouble holding despite these scapular exercises being added to my routine.

I know that during a pushup for optimal effectiveness and safety, your shoulders should be depressed and reteacted, but i noticed ehile working towards a planche that I struggle with extending my arms fully in the planche's elevated, protracted shoulder position. 

So i started doing incline pushups with that shoulder position, really focusing on slow, steady-form reps, and let me tell you, I felt this exercise more than ive felt any other new exercise ive added in a long time. No pain, but really really strong activation signals, or so it seems at least. 

Since myself and my clients are climbers, we often find ourselves in unorthodox, unstable, and sub-optimal body positions. Im wondering if doing pushups with different shoulder positions (performed by advanced clients, with this specific goal of building shoulder stability in all areas of the shoulder) is a justified risk.

I'm aware that shoulders should be ret and dep fore safety purposes, but is it worth it to pursue these exercises further? Can it even possibly reduce risk of injury for people like climbers during their sport?



TLDR: Climber looking to improve shoulder 
stability. While generally unsafe for beginners, can an advanced client see benefits from performing pushups in all variants of shoulder positioning, and CAN IT be safe if done PROPERLY?

Also this might be in the Wrong place but in all fairness this topic is a question about variations and form of an exercise.",Baba_Yaga420,self.Exercise,1571573644

Exercise,"GRENADE PROTEIN BARS, ARE THEY WORTH IT?","So as I struggle eating enough calories in the day, I will sometimes opt for a grenade protein bar to boost my calories and protein intake (after a workout) and I was wondering whether these protein bars are actually bad to eat often (2 times a week). Like am I going to gain weight from eating these? My diet is pretty clean and I don’t eat anything sweet like chocolate etc, this is the thing closest to chocolate that I eat. 

Just wonder what everyone thinks about these. I eat around 1300 calories (I’m getting my intake back up to a healthy amount ik it’s bad rn) a day and burn 500 off through walking and biking 5 times a week. Im a female, 5’6 and 155 pounds",lviol1,self.Exercise,1571264375
Exercise,How do I start exercising steadily? I’m so sore I give up.,"I’ve changed my diet and lost 4 lbs on that alone in the past month. I’m 5’6” and 136 lbs, so I’m at a healthy weight, but I want to continue making healthier choices. I’m definitely way out of shape; I’m pretty sure the only reason I’m thin is due to my metabolism. 

Part of making better choices is adding 30 minutes of exercise a day, right? I’ve never done that before in my life. I started out with normal exercises like 30 jumping jacks, 10 push-ups, a short jog, 10 burpees, etc to fill up the thirty minutes. My goal wasn’t to target anything, just to get my blood moving and burn some calories. 

I’ve tried to do exercises listed above about three separate occasions now and every time my body HURTS so bad the next day I can’t possibly exercise again. This severe soreness stays about 3 days and then goes away. Obviously I need more than an hr of exercise a week so I’m at a loss on what I can do. 

I’ve tried stretching beforehand. I have sufficient protein in my diet. I drink at least 60 ounces of water a day. I’ve tried baths with epsom salt after work outs. Nothing helps :(. What can I do? 

TL;DR: Exercise makes my body sore for three days. I have enough protein, drink plenty of water, only stick to 30 minutes of exercise with small breaks in between activities, and I’ve tried a bath with epsom salt to calm my muscles. Nothing helps at all. The soreness is so severe I can barely stand to touch the muscles the next day. What do I do?",Mrswizardwizard,self.Exercise,1571260874

Exercise,I train way better when I'm hungry/fasted,"Can anybody shed any light on this? Whenever I do cardio-based stuff like running or CrossFit, I perform waaaaay better when I'm either fasted (train first thing in the morning before breakfast) or really hungry (train in the evening when I haven't eaten since lunch). It seems so counter-intuitive since we use glycogen for energy. And the difference is BIG! Like it's  the difference between running 8km before I need a break vs. 5km before I need a break. 

And I'm not comparing it to training after having just eaten (where you would obviously feel bloated and gross). I'm talking about that sweet spot where you ate a couple hours ago so you're not hungry but your food is digested. I just seem to train so lethargically when I'm not hungry. And it seems to be a linear relationship. The hungrier I am, the better I perform.

I also spoke to my physiotherapist about coming up with modifications for 1 of my exercises, because the one was seriously tiring me out, to the point where it reduced my motivation and even ability to do the others. (Challenge = Good. Exhaustion = Not So Good.) So, I'm still feeling super motivated to rock this challenge! Only 11 weeks to a new and improved me!

How about you? You feeling motivated to rock this? :)

I would also feel disappointed if I couldn't run as far as I would like because I couldn't 'show off' the distance.

I started to think about why I was running in the first place. Mental health, relaxation, exercise, fitness. And when my breath became too quick I was able to think about my breath, in, out, in, out. It meant I could run further, enjoy it more and above all run for the run.

Yes I tracked it... but for my own benefit. Not for sharing. And I didn't share with anyone but me.

Exercise,Best Exercise Routines?,"Hello Redditors!

Would you give me feedback on my workout routine because I want to optimize it :)

I'm a 23 year old female, 5'7"", 156 lbs for reference.


Mondays:
1 hour Body Phit class - this involves tons of intense cardio, weights, and challenging tasks like squats, lunges, wall sits, etc.   Basically extremely hard for me and makes me sore for 3 days.

Wednesdays:
1 hour Vinyasa flow yoga.   Teacher usually focuses on hip openers and inversions, and will add a lot of ab heavy work in here.  
I'll usually also do 20 minutes of cardio (ellyptical) after the class because yoga makes me feel so good.

Thursdays:
1 hour pranayama flow yoga.  Very calm and relaxing class. Great for my mental health.  Involves lots of stretching like hamstrings and shoulder stretches that help any remaining soreness. 
I'll usually do weight machines after the class, typically, because I need to do more weights and simply do not have time before yoga to do it.

Also did 30 reps of leg press (level 6, 7, 8)
20 reps leg curls (level 5)
20 reps leg extensions (level 5)
20 reps biceps (level 3)
20 reps chest press (level 3)
16 reps shoulder press (level 1)
Lat pulldown 20 reps (level 2)


Saturdays: 1 hour pranayama flow.  Very relaxing class.  I'll usually also do like 20 minutes of cardio afterwards and maybe some weights if I'm feeling it.   I love to run but it hurts my knees insanely so I've essentially replaced it with cardio.

So here's the question:
What can I do to improve my workout schedule? Should I be doing any other workouts other than the ones listed? Conversely, do you think this is too much?

I work at a desk, but it's a conversion desk. I usually will alternate sitting and standing, half and half if possible, but after Monday class it can be hard to do that on Tuesday.

I face a ton of joint pain but I eat extremely healthy to manage it, along with making my own turmeric supplements as well and tracking my hormones to eat / workout in accordance with my cycle.


Can you think of anything to improve this schedule?",kelcamer,self.Exercise,1570762537

Exercise,Swimming is so much more effective than running.,"I don’t deny that running has a lot of benefits: 

You can burn hundreds of calories running five miles and burn off the fat while building your leg muscles. 

However, running takes a big toll on your body especially on your knees and joints. 

That’s why I recommend swimming over running. 

Why? 

(1) more muscles worked
Swimming works out more muscles than does running. Running primarily targets your leg muscles and a few arm muscles. However, swimming targets muscles throughout the body ranging from your shoulders to your chest to your obliques all the way to your quads. 

Swimming a lot can make you look more buff especially on your upper body than running will. 

(2) you can swim a lot more without the fear of injuring your body 

50 laps of 25 meters burns about 500 calories give or take some depending on your weight and metabolism. To achieve the same calories burned in running you would have to run about 5 miles. Yet, you can swim this much and the worst injuries you might get are pulled muscles or a tear in shoulder muscle. With running on the other hand, you put yourself at risk for torn muscles, injuries to your joints, injured knees, sprained ankles, plantar fasciitis, and the list just goes on and on. 

(3) swimming makes you more flexible than running can

Swimming aids the range of motion especially for the torso, shoulder, and hips. Running can’t do the same. 
 
This can aid you even if you are participating in other sports such as football or basketball. Seahawks qb Russell Wilson swims a lot in the offseason to help aid his durability. He also hasn’t had any major injuries in a sport notorious for them.",nouseforaname888,self.Exercise,1570746346

Exercise,One specific exercise and why these are the results?,"Hello. Wanted to share a new exercise that Ive heard about and implemented today.

It's basically for the upper back and neck to have a better alignment of the body.

You stand with your heels, ass, upper back and back of the hesd touching the wall, hands next to the thighs. From this position raise arms while holding them straight up until they touch the wall. While doing so, don't let your back arch.

Harder modification is to sit with your legs straight while doing so. Same action.

Last, hardest modification is to bend your knees so that not just lower back is disconnected by sitting but also legs. Do the same action. Suggested amount was 50 times per one modification.

However! My experience was interesting. I was able to hit upper back, shoulders and arms were working also but interestingly, my right mid-lower back was also exercising while doing so meanwhile the left side didn't feel the load at all.

And my observation is that my right side of the back is more tense and is bigger (as if the muscle is bigger).

But that raises a question to me- does that mean that back left side is weaker or the right side is weaker? And how do I test that?",iNhab,self.Exercise,1570658995

Exercise,3 days a week cardio and weights,"Hello, looking for advice.  

Due to my schedule I need to keep my workouts to 3 or 4 days per week.  Also, due to my various join issues, I can not readily combine cardio activity with muscle building activity.  

Currently I am weight lifting 3 days per week: Wed: full body.  Saturday: push, Sunday: pull.  

I would like to add cardio,  due to my joint issues, HIIT is pretty much out.   I was thinking I would do 30 minutes of service 70%-80% cardio after my weight lifting session each day.

Is this going to be too much all at once?  Obviously doing a pretty tough cardio session after a  pretty tough weight session will negatively impact both to some degree.  I am not out to win any weightlifting or bodybuilding competitions so that seems okay.   Total workout time would be about 90-120 minutes 3x per week.

One summer I decided to not condition and lost all interest by this year. It might sound weird but I really do enjoy running and I miss being with the team. I didn't join this year since I didn't want to hold the team back.

I've let myself go due to the stress of college (just graduated), starting a new full-time job, depression, and losing my thyroid to radioactive iodine but I'm tired of excuses and I really want to find a sustainable daily routine. I used to mainly do weights, but now I don't have a gym (I could get a membership but I want to commit to some form of exercise first). I used to run every now and then but my doctor thinks that I somehow developed a chronic exercise induced compartment syndrome, which, if you don't know what that means, is where my muscles contract to the point that blood can't flow properly in my leg. My leg becomes hard, and very painful. I was never formally diagnosed, so it could be something else (which would make sense, since this disorder is typically found in hardcore athletes). I'd like to be able to run, it's a great exercise and I don't need a gym to do it. But per my doctor, he thinks only low impact exercises are good. I don't know if there is something I can do to make running possible again... Other than that, I was a competitive swimmer in middle school and high school and I would not mind swimming (other than hating my swim suit bod lol), but I'd need a gym membership for that.

**Age: 26**   
**Height: 5 6″**

Perhaps it's just me, but 390 calories seems like A LOT for 1 hour and 10 minutes of fast walking.

Exercise,Rant: overtraining,"I’m tired of seeing people ask for exercise advice along the lines of “I’m doing X,Y,Z daily or five days a week. Is this a good program.” and somebody replies “doing such and such every training will lead to overtraining”. 

This is not true at all. Yes, there are better ways to structure a training regiment to foster better results over time and usually you switch up your day to day a bit. And yes, you raise the risk for injury if intensity, frequency, and volume aren’t properly considered. That said, overtraining is a state where someone trains so much that their body simply can’t repair itself fast enough. I’ve seen people site you can overtrain if you do the 100 pushups a day challenge. Simply put, that’s BS. If that were the case, every carpenter, painter, construction worker, etc would be over trained at some point in their life. Your body adapts to what it needs to do. So, if you do 100 pushups everyday, then in a few weeks 100 pushups really won’t cause any damage to the muscle at all. People throw the idea around when it’s very very rare. It’s a lack of motivation and muscle soreness that is usually the issue.",WaterCasserole007,self.Exercise,1570075974

When I was 13-15 I used to do some kinds of exercises like Bicep curls,and other moves,on some super light weights, (1.5 - 4.5 kg lol) 

And I did them nonstop. For 10 mins,not stopping,at all. No breaks. I had no clue how to properly exercise.

So now,my muscles stutter whenever I raise them or move them,similar to the exercise movement. However,it doesnt really bother or annoy me,unless I try to do it on purpose.

Same goes for other muscles like,triceps or lower abs..

Oh,and one another thing,my knees.

This happened a few days ago,when I tried to do lunges,my left knee.. just started hurting. Like it was stinging from the inside.

And whenever,nowadays I try to stand up,my left knee just hurts. Its like - I forgot how to properly stand up,perhaps because its such a normal thing you dont usually think about doing,so its more difficult to.. remember how to do it properly.

Its also different in terms of shape. And it hurts to touch.",JuhpPug,self.Exercise,1570025822

Exercise,"Belly fat and 0 flexibility, no real exercise for almost a decade, how to start","Hey there

In this last year I changed my eating habits and lost 7 kilos. So now I weight 78kg, and I'm 1.75cm. I'm not fat but have some extra meat, but the problem is the belly(which all started many years ago).  I hate that gut sticking out. I've seen fatter people with no gut. So anyway, lately I've been going on some walks, mornings or nights. Thing is, I also need something that kills the calories a bit quicker but also gives me flexibility little by little because right now I can barely reach down my knees with my hands, let alone my feet.

Given my complete rusty body and belly fat(little now but still sticking) what kind of flexibility exercises should I do daily? Note, I know the best way to kill the belly fat is probably by running(I'm guessing, I could be wrong) but my lack of flexibility is scaring, I want to take care of this quickly as I'm 32 years old.

    A few weeks ago I made the decision to start working out with the goal of gaining hopefully 15-20 lbs in the long run. I started tracking my calories, calculated my BMR and added 500 calories per day. I also bought a fitness watch so I would have an idea of how many calories I was burning per day, and it links to my calorie tracking app and deducts those calories automatically from what I’ve consumed already. I bought two protein powders. One the typical whey with more protein than anything else, and the second is a gainer for those days where I hadn’t quite met my calorie needs for the day. 

    I’ve mainly been doing some dumbbell workouts at home, I don’t want to go to barbell exercises until I feel I’ve got my posture under control so that I don’t hurt myself trying to lift too heavy before I’m ready.

   Fast forward to this morning, I haven’t weighed myself in nearly a week and a half because I know weighing yourself too often will throw you off more than anything. I step on the scale and see that I’ve actually lost 2 lbs. this was extremely disappointing, and put me in a down mood all day. For clarity I am a very active person, I work a trades job, live on a small hobby farm, constantly lifting things, probably walk anywhere from 8-15 kms per day. I have little to no bodyfat, so I know that most likely the weight I’ve lost has been muscle mass.

   Have any ectomorphs successfully gained weight? How did you do it? Should I add another 500 calories to my daily intake? It’s been extremely disappointing to be trying to hard and actually be going backwards. Thanks for any input!",Nothingelsematters20,self.Exercise,1569542253

I loved the book that came with it and all the science that was behind such an important part of your body and why strengthening them could help your day to day life in so many ways. As an avid athlete I could see the increased power I was gaining behind this seemingly small adjustment.The book had many different exercises and I mostly used this on the simpler workouts. The dvd helped to clarify any issues I had with the workouts and helped to make sure that I was doing the exercise correct. I used the dvd a few times now and every time I tried the different exercises I felt I was gaining more and more power every time I worked out. Although I mostly got this for the sport advantages the difference was more than just power. I sit almost daily for 8+ hours and I've notice that I have a way better posture and my

lower back doesn't hurt anymore as I used to have a nagging injury there. Overall the product worked better than I expected and would recommend this to anyone looking to increase power in athletics or to help their posture.

Exercise,Recurring Calf Muscle Strain/Tear While Running,"Two months ago while jogging, about a half mile in, I felt an ""unzipping"" in my calf muscle, followed by moderate pain, enough that I stopped and walked home. I figured I tore it or strained it (maybe those are the same thing?)

In the meantime, while healing, I've been riding my bike, 10-12 miles at a pop, three times a week or so. 

After two months I figured I had surely healed enough so I decided to go for a run today. About 3/4 of a mile in, the same spot, same muscle, started progressively hurting more with each step. No unzip this time, but after maybe a dozen strides, the pain level was similar. So I walked home again. 

Now I'm limping pretty good with moderate discomfort. 

What am I doing wrong? What should I do differently?

At the moment I stretch before starting my run, but that's it. Calfs, quads, hamstrings, etc. Any advice to put an end to this foolishness would help.

Exercise,effects on your body after regular HIIT workout (think: Barry's),"Hey guys! 

I (29F) started going to HIIT workout classes regularly about 5 months ago. I do Barry's, running, and yoga (\~6 times a week) now. I've become pretty fit, and my body looks like someone who regularly works out.

A few changes I noticed about my body. 

Mainly how I've become a magnet for mosquitoes. It's crazy how much mosquitoes love me. I wasn't like this before I started working out regularly, but now wherever I go, I get bites, even after I put repellent all over my body.  The other day, I was with 6 friends, and was the only one who got any mosquito bites (5! to be more precise) in an hour even though I was wearing long sleeves and everyone else just a t-shirt.

I also noticed that my body is warmer. Often I would say to my husband our bedroom is too hot, when he thinks it's fine. We had never had any room temperature issue before (about 3 years of sharing a bed together). It only has become an issue starting this summer. 

Has anyone noticed the same change to their bodies after regular workout? Is there any science behind this?",future_orange,self.Exercise,1569153155
Exercise,Moving side to side,"I'm a really big guy and I feel limited to exercising at home.  It's way easier that way, but there is limited space.  Do you think stepping side to side while moving my arms, kind of like dancing, is as good as walking?  Could there be a benefit like it being easier on my knees?  Or is this a good enough exercise in general?

Not expecting it to burn much calories that I lose weight from it.  I'm doing it more for my mental health, energy, and to prevent blood clots.",eversunday,self.Exercise,1569146810

Exercise,Help with transitioning from cycling to running when you hate running?,"Hey so I currently occasionally cycle, but I want to start running. Not long distance, more like HIIT (fast but short). 

The problem is that I despise running. Whenever I run, it feels like the bottom/under of my tongue numbs up and turns to jelly and it's a really weird feeling. Also, I get sweaty whereas on the bike I don't because of the wind.

I want to transition to running because it's getting colder here so the bike is too windy. Plus, I want to exercise different muscle groups. (Also I secretly want to prepare myself for a zombie apocalypse but that's besides the point.)

How do I start? I already have a great pair of running shoes and descent pants. I want to buy new tops that don't show any sweat + a descent running jacket that isn't restrictive but is warm. And in terms of the actual running part itself, what's the best way to start running? Should I just run for however long I can at a fast speed (like a minute at first) and increase it every day? How do I combat the incredibly uncomfortable tongue sensation?

Thanks. I appreciate any answers.",ghostaaaa,self.Exercise,1569114792
Exercise,"I (31, F, 157cm, 63kg) have trouble losing weight, hitting protein goal on deficit"," 

So  I'm currently trying to lose a few kg of bodyfat (BF currently at about  35%) as I'm slightly overweight and my BF is too high (needs to be  under 33% for my gender and age range). I've been eating at about  1,500cal per day for almost five weeks now (TDEE estimated at about  1,950cal), work out at my gym (strength training on machines and with  dumbbells, whole-body routine taking about an hour ten plus warm-up) two  to three times a week, and have started adding some bodyweight  exercises in on my off days a week ago. So far, I've only lost about a  kg (which seems to be mostly BF, though) although I was hoping for  closer to half a kg per week (which would be about 2.5kg by now), and  it's been almost stagnating for two weeks now.

I'm  progressing with my strength training, and have lost some waist  circumference, but I'm still kind of disappointed with my weight loss/BF  loss so far.

Also, at only  1,500cal daily, I'm struggling with hitting my protein goal for the day  (126g). I'm not living alone, and we're on a pretty tight budget for  groceries, so just getting enough fish or chicken breast every day isn't  a viable option (although it's by far the best calorie:protein ratio  I've seen so far outside of protein powder, which I already take once  per day).

Any advice? Do I just  need to be more patient, or do I need to cut down my daily calories even  more (and then what about my protein)? Or should I just go up to maintenance and try to recomp (as I'm still pretty much a beginner)?",Miro_the_Dragon,self.Exercise,1569113193

Exercise,Need much less sleep after including cardio,"My lifestyle is sedentary since I got the internet on my pc and that was 10 years ago.

In the teenage years I was moving more but the last 3 years I don't have physical activity except working out. I spend my days working on my laptop.

I think rhe cardio and the working out really impact differently on our body.

Before 10 days I included cardio after every gym session. Just 15-30 minutes of walking and running when I can. Now, I sleep less and I'm more focused and have more energy than when I was sleeping 9 hours. Incredible! I can really be boring with my sleep because that was making me problems with my work which requires focus. So, I'm not forcing anything, it's not placebo but feels awesome.

I am a 22 year old male.

I am relatively fit but not athletic.

I have mitral valve prolapse but no other problems with my heart. I am however, quite anxious with things that have to do with it.

I am doing krav maga and as the weather is hot I feel very tired sometimes. sessions are 1.5 hours long and contain many explosive exercises e.g jumping as high as you can or doing burpees. For the last months I feel very tired when working out. 1-2 times I was not well hydrated and started feeling exhausted ( I felt like I was prone to fainting if I continuted). I generally drink 1.5 liters of water during sessions and I'm still thirsty. Exercise takes place in a room without A/C. The temperature there is like 28 C. Humidity outside is said to be like 50% but I believe inside the room will be more as there are many people sweating. I have noticed my heart rate going to points I believe are too high (166 20 seconds after stoping exercise so I believe it should be \~ 185 when exercising).

Do you think it is safe doing such a workout under these conditions?  
Am I putting unnecessary strain on my heart?

I exercise different muscle groups on different days, trying to cut out unhealthy sugars and junk food, and I am ultimately trying to lose weight and gain a bit of muscle.

Exercise,What are the riskiest and risk free exercises?,"So basically here is my story first.

I am 5'6"". 26 year old male. I started getting fat and bulking around the age of 12 and I bulked to 86 kg in 14 years. So I decided to lose weight and cut, so I started July 15th of this year. I did a diet that made me so depressed but in a month I lost 5 kgs. After that I stopped that diet and ate healthy without dieting and exercised but ever since that 5 kg I am not losing any weight.

I don't look good. I have a huge stomach and a huge chest that I want to be flat both of those.

Now that I do exercise. My exercises are swimming, running and lots of bodyweight exercises like wall push ups, knee push ups, etc...

Also now that we have an outdoor gym with lots of stuff, I wanna try those too. But I am really afraid though that might hurt my back bone, knees, bones, muscles, etc....

So I wanted to know what are the risk free exercises that anyone can do without the help of any instructor and what are the risky exercises to avoid. I mean what are the exercises that won't hurt yourself even if you are doing it wrong and what will hurt you if you does it even slightly wrong.

I did the LAT pulldown machine 2 days ago, and still am experiencing unusual discomfort with movement in my upper abdomen. I don't see anything protruding so don't think it's a hernia. It just feels uncomfortable (like how you would feel when constipated) and a little nauseous from it. The only thing I can think of is a muscle strain since it feels better after taking pain relievers and resting. I did this machine without having done it in months so Its definitely exercise related. This all started 3 hours after I used the machine. Did anyone else experience this???",Hawaiilover2020,self.Exercise,1568040098

Exercise,What happens when I skip certain moves?,"I’m a female, who’s been working out for a while now. Tbh I’m not very athletic and I’d been overweight until about 2 years ago I decided to shed pounds to become however I look like right now; and to explain that, I look quite normal, thin around the waist and generally alright, but since I shed pounds by only dieting and not exercising back then, I’m not really tight and my legs are thicker than any other part of my body and I’ve got some belly fat either so, that’s how I decided to work out. I mean, nothing’s “that” unsatisfying for me about how I look but why not better? 
But the thing is, I can get myself to do anything but since I’m not really athletic and pretty much the only sports I’ve been into until this moment was ping pong so, I just can’t find the motivation to work out. I work out 3 days at most and when I do, I tend to skip some moves. In fact, I decide I’ll skip moves even before leaving the house to go to the gym so that it gives me the motivation to go there, makes me feel like it isn’t that hard. So that’s kind of my solution; skip some moves, or don’t work out at all. 
But the thing is, does skipping those moves make the whole process useless? 
My moves are mostly focused on legs so it generally goes like; 
Trx squat (I generally skip this)
Leg press
Squat DB shoulder press
Lying leg curl
Hip thrust (Skip)
Kettle bell swing
Adduction

These are the main moves,
And additional to those, one day I do these:
Seated row
Cable curl
Sit up

And the other day, these:
DB lateral raises
Triceps push down (skip) 
Leg raises

Exercise,Anyone here have exercise induce athsma? And/or swim for exercise?,"Hi! First time poster here. I think I may need some encouragement and some advice because I’m getting frustrated here.

First off, I SUCK at sports. I’ve always tried, but I was always out of breath to the point of being in pain. Turns out (I just found this out a few months ago) I have exercise induced asthma  and all this time I thought it was because I was so out of shape. I decided to talk to a doctor after about 7 months of doing kickboxing self defense classes and the pain just stopped me from going on. It also made me dizzy and I missed out on concentrating on directions. I was breaking out in tears it was so bad. Chest pain, coughing and wheezing, I saw the doctor and he gave me an inhaler to take before exercise.

I tried it for the first time before going to run on the treadmill at the gym.  So I started running, and I kept running...and running! It didn’t hurt! I was smiling from ear to ear! I was SO excited! If only I had known sooner, I could have had a much healthier life.  However, I was eventually gasping for air, but I was just happy I wasn’t in pain anymore.

So I still take the inhaler before exercise, but I still have trouble breathing and am short of breath. However, the pain is not there anymore and neither is the wheezing or coughing. I’m trying to understand this. I called my doctor and asked if maybe I should take more of the inhaler, he just sent me prednisone and to call him back to tell him if it worked. It didn’t do anything. If it did it was minuscule. I didn’t call him back. I have the feeling he doesn’t care. I decided maybe I was just being a baby and things will get better.

4 months later and it’s still hard to breathe. I’ve become less motivated to exercise. I didn’t feel like going to kickboxing much anymore. I had to put it on freeze because money is tight because I’m getting married. I’m trying swimming now, and once again, the breathing is an issue. I have to stop every lap and catch my breath. I LOVE swimming. I want to get better at it! I just want to enjoy something and be good at it. 

Does someone have exercise induced asthma? Do you deal with the same thing? Do any of you swim and can give advice on breathing? I could use someone to talk to. Thank you in advance.",Lilcrumb033,self.Exercise,1567378380

I felt good enough to do a brisk walk this morning. 3mph average pace for almost 30 min. Reached 130bpm from the brisk walk, which should tell you just how out of shape I am. But I also wasn't well hydrated and had a cup of coffee prior to the walk and am on my monthly, so trying to keep those factors in mind.

I am going to keep going and make this a daily thing. I need to get healthy again but also know that I need to take it slow. 

Resting heart rate average is in the mid-80s during the day and in the low 60s while sleeping, so I think it's safe to say my lack of heart health is anxiety-induced. :p Sometimes my resting heart rate goes into the triple digits randomly for a minute or two during the day... But again, I'm sure it's just anxiety and cortisol spikes.

Exercise,Newbie questions regarding muscle growth and fat burning,"As I (m, mid-20s) use a wheelchair due to my disability, I have never really done any exercise because I couldn't find any activity that doesn't require much planning that I simultaneously enjoy. After ages, I finally received a handbike a few weeks ago, and it's just awesome to be outside while doing something good for myself! Still more exhausting than it probably should be but I'm well aware that I'm only getting started.

Atm, I'm at 175cm/76kg (5'7""/167lbs) which is technically fine with me, but I definitely want to work on that muscle-to-fat ratio. Now I know that endurance-based activities such as cycling might not be the most suitable for muscle gain, but for me it's the most practical option right now, so please keep that in mind. Not saying I won't continue looking for other activities to strain my muscles more equally.

Now for my questions:  
I've never really counted my calories but I've been eating more healthily since last year. Given my goal of maintaining my weight while losing fat and gaining muscles, should I just continue eating the same while doing moderate exercise, or is eating more while also burning more calories (same net intake) any more or less beneficial?

Secondly, is subjective effort an indicator for calorie burn, i.e. does a newbie who is sweating like hell after a 15km (10mi) ride (me) burn any more calories than an experienced person over the same distance?

Exercise,Overtraining Symptoms: Are You A Victim?,"These days, you can't spend more than five minutes in a locker room, or read three pages in a magazine without coming across the term ""overtraining."" In a way, overtraining seems to be like sub-prime mortgages: nobody really knows what it is, but it sure is responsible for some bad things.

So today we shall analyze:

1. What constitutes overtraining.
2. If you are affected and how to fix it.
3. How to use overtraining (or better said: overreaching) to your advantage.

**What is Overtraining?**

Basically, [overtraining](https://hvmn.com/blog/training/overtraining-syndrome-can-sabotage-performance) occurs whenever the volume and intensity of someone's workouts are exceeding their ability to recover. This means progress is coming to a screeching halt, due to delayed recovery and elevated cortisol levels.

You are likely to lose mass and strength in the process. Other symptoms include irritability, lack of appetite, sleeplessness, loss of enthusiasm and motivation. Even depression is in the cards for you. You are more likely to get sick and/or injured, and your little injuries will take longer to heal.

Muscles recover within 48 hours, which is when protein synthesis rates level off. So if you experience any of the above symptoms I would recommend a 48-72 hour hiatus from the gym with a solid calorie surplus and a daily nap. Within 3 days, you should be able to return to the gym and continue on your path to eternal glory and total awesomeness.

**Cases of Severe Overtraining**

Unfortunately, not all cases of overtraining are cured so easily. If the central nervous system (CNS) is overstimulated, the recovery process will take a much longer time. In those cases, the athlete often experiences light to medium depression, loss of libido, elevated pulse rate and deep-seated fatigue.

Very often, this condition goes hand in hand with adrenal burnout (those [pre-workout](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/store/category/pre-workout.html) stims have their downsides, for sure). Here the first order of business is caffeine, yohimbine, ephedra, etc out, passionflower, melatonin, L-tyrosine and ZMA in. Also, you will need to take a whole week or 10 days from the gym.

This also includes a mental break. Try not to spend too much time at the muscle and strength website - just this once though! You can engage in other activities, just no weight training or spending time inside a gym. Additional recovery measures such as acupuncture, cryotherapy or massage can be extremely helpful during that time.

You should start taking your resting pulse rate in the morning, in order to have a baseline. Once it has dropped by five or more beats per minute, you can make an attempt to return to the gym - but you should cut your workload in half (at least for the first two weeks). From there on you can work your way back.",myrtleeeb,self.Exercise,1566951255

Exercise,Alternative to Strength training,"Hello, I have been on a weight-loss journey for the past year or so with the help of a personal trainer(doing weight lifts).  I lost 37 pounds but there is an issue.  I keep getting injuries in different parts of my muscles because my personal trainer has been getting negligent over time(its my fault too.  I should have been more stubborn when I said the weights is too much instead of trusting him that everything would be ok).

I have now an injury that severely limits my arm movement(hopefully not forever but it may need surgery), but to me this was the last straw and I left my trainer.  After all the injuries I want to stay away from traditional weight lifting if possible(Emotionally weight lifting at the gym has such a negative association for me right now).

  I am still in recovery and not looking for medical advice, but instead wanted to ask for alternatives to strength training to build up muscle while losing weight(once I recover...in the meantime I will rest and walk when I can).  I'm not looking to be a body builder, but I would like to continue my weight loss journey while keeping my muscles in good shape to keep a healthy lifestyle.

I was thinking that maybe Strength Yoga, but honestly I have no clue.  I was wondering if I could get some advice on alternatives(Maybe lighter weights but more times per week, or exercise from a video instead of personal trainer?  I currently don't want to hire another one)?  

My workout was- 40 minute walks a day, Diet recommendations, and weight lifting 1/2 hour for 3 days a week.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks!",bzngabazooka,self.Exercise,1566888818

Exercise,Do I stretch before or after jogging on a treadmill?,"For the first time in my life I'm gonna start exercising and I want to start out easy with just light jogginng and a stretch routine to improve flexibility. I told my mom this and she said that I should speed walk on a treadmill first and then stretch because I'll be warmed up for the stretches, but aren't you supposed to stretch before jogging so your muscles won't be sore the next day? I mean, that's pretty much what every gym class I've taken since middle school has taught me.

She also said that I shouldn't jog yet, and just speed walk, but idk if that would actually be as effective as jogging (and even if it is I just think I'd look silly). She gets a lot of her info from Facebook and she's into Herbalife so sometimes I take her health advice with a grain of salt, but shes been exercising for way longer than I have so I have no point of reference.

Exercise,Hip Flexors/Back Pain &amp; Crunches?,"I rarely do abs because some forms of crunches really kill my lower back. I usually get frustrated and call it quits. I did a little digging and I decided to treat the problem as if it was an issue with my hip flexors.

First, I started stretching my hip flexors more, thinking it was a flexibility issue, but saw no changes over a few weeks. Then, I tried strengthening them instead using a few different exercises at the end of every session, right before stretching (I did stop stretching them so much around this time). Still, the lower back pain persists.

I use the back bench occasionally (not sure what the actual name is, but it’s like a backwards crunch where you bend over at the hips and pop back up) and do deadlifts frequently to strengthen my lower back but I still see no results as far as decreased back pain.

I mostly notice the back pain when I’m doing crunches that require me to straighten my legs up off the ground (like leg raises) but also in crunches like the Russian Twist. I notice pain when I use the incline sit-up bench as well. Basically the only crunches I can do are bicycles, bent leg raises, and plain jane crunches.

I believe my form is correct and not the issue. My abs are engaged and my lower abs are pulled down to my spine to protect my lower back. My spine doesn’t curve, it stays flat to the ground.

Other forms of ab work that are done not laying on the ground never seem as effective for me. Planks and mountain climbers tire out my arms more than anything, and as much as I engage my abs I feel like it does nothing. As miserable as crunches are, it really is the most effective for me so I’d like to figure this out.

Has anyone experienced this, and how have you overcome it? Is it usually a hip flexor issue like I believe it is for me? What are some effective alternative ways to work abs that have worked for you?",honestlywhytho,self.Exercise,1566531333

Exercise,"Constant low energy, despite active lifestyle?","Hi everyone,

So I've really been struggling with lethargy and general fogginess. I got back into exercise in November 2018 after being fairly sedentary for about 2 years. One of the main reasons being that I was told it would improve my chronic fatigue!

My routine is as follows:

Monday: weight training

Tuesday morning: light sunrise walk (2km)

Wednesday morning: Pilates

Thursday night: Pole dancing (I'm quite experienced, so it's pretty heavy duty)

Saturday: Pole dancing solo practice 1 hour

Other than that I aim for at least 10k steps each day and I work a typical desk job, 8-5. I try to stand at my standing desk, but I've been just too tired lately.

My diet is fairly balanced, though I do have a sweet tooth and have gummies around my time of the month and treat myself every weekend. Otherwise I follow the low GI lifestyle. I try to eat 2 serves of red meat per week, but usually it equates to 1. I drink 1-2 coffees a day. I also take a women's multi, hair and nails supplement and vitamin C each morning. 

I had my bloods checked recently and while my iron levels are on the lower end, they are still within the healthy range.

The medications I am on are an SSRI/Lovan 1/4 each day (I am super sensitive) and 1/2 tablet of dostinex each week.

My sleep routine is OK. I moved in with my BF 2 months ago and he has insomnia, so he gets up a lot or tosses and turns. I would say he is resting properly 3-4 nights a week. I was struggling with lethargy prior to living together though, so I can't attribute it to that. 

If you see any red flags in the above routine, please let me know. I'm tired of, well, being tired!",ThanksGosling,self.Exercise,1566264361

Exercise,A Beginner’s Guide to Fitness &amp; Nutrition: Research Based Educational Content &amp; Free Workout Programs," Hi everyone.

I recently wrote a collection of free detailed workouts and research based educational content for my own personal training clients that I thought might be helpful to some of you here. This is essentially every bit of info that I’d want to teach a new client within the first month or two of training, all laid out in an easy to follow format.

All programs emphasize free weights, target either strength and/or hypertrophy, include supplemental fat loss cardio, and can be downloaded for free in high resolution for easy access. Accompanying the workout programs on my site are research based articles that dive into the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind major exercise/nutrition topics and provide you with the tools to design and/or tweak your own routines and be more self-sufficient.

Think of my site as an ebook - the Guides are the chapters/sections and the Programs are fully developed examples of the exercise concepts that you can follow or just use as starting points to build/tweak your own workouts.

While there’s a ton of useful stuff all throughout the site (I’m biased) and I’d love for you to browse around, the following links are probably the most important, as they focus on major exercise/nutrition topics and are great starting points for beginners.

* [Nutrition: Fueling For Fitness](https://fitstra.com/nutrition-fueling-for-fitness/) \- How nutrition habits affect exercise performance and research based dietary strategies to help maximize muscle growth, efficiently lose fat, and get the most out of your workouts. (If that's too long of read, focus on sections 7-9)
* [Strength &amp; Hypertrophy: A Programming Guide](https://fitstra.com/strength-hypertrophy-training/) \- The very basics of strength/hypertrophy training and how to design an effective, research based weight training program.
* [Fat Loss​ Programming](https://fitstra.com/fat-loss-programming/) \- How we lose weight through cardiovascular exercise and an easy to follow, research based guide for fat loss programming.
*  [Warming Up: Why &amp; How](https://fitstra.com/warming-up-why-how/) \- The exercise performance benefits of warming up and how to build your own effective routine. 
* [Beginner 3\[1.1\]](https://fitstra.com/programs-beginner/) \- This program is an introductory weight lifting routine designed to familiarize those that have little to no previous exercise experience with a few basic movement patterns and the barbell. If you’re interested in incorporating a more serious weight training program into your routine but don’t know where or how to begin, this is the place to start. This program is ideally meant to serve as a temporary (2-6 month) learning period that allows new lifters to transition onto more intense and higher frequency routines.
* [Here are all of the other programs.](https://fitstra.com/programs/) They range from simple Upper/Lower splits to more high volume/frequency Legs/Push/Push variations. Lots of fun, free stuff.

If you have any feedback/criticism/questions, shoot them my way. I’d love to help out if I can. I hope you find the above content useful.

Thanks!

I was reading up on 6 packs and I found quite a few links and threads on how maintaining them is bad for you. I used to be a pretty skinny guy with a runner's frame and so I had a 6 pack since I was 14. I used to almost be severely underweight though I've been trying to bring it up in the past 2 years which has been a mild success as I am about 1kg/m2 from hitting a healthy weight. I've been going to the gym about 2 days a week for awhile now. Due to my well-developed abs, I can bulk to 16% body fat without losing my 6 pack and I usually float at around 10%. 
My thing is I want to be healthy and have a high s/w ratio as a powerlifter but some people say having abs is unnatural which is hard for me to lose without almost always eating shitty foods.
Is this 6 pack is unnatural and unhealthy thing bs or should I stop jogging twice a week?",HazomePVP,self.Exercise,1566140818

Exercise,Core exercise suggestions,"What are your go to's for core strengthening exercises?  My back locks up, below my ribs.  Had everything checked.  Dr. said to strengthen my core.  I looked at stuff online.  I was doing back strokes in the pool while waiting on dr to look at back.

Started back to gym this week.  I decided on incline walking., walking until I felt anything and building slowly from there.  

Monday I did 20 min and felt a twinge in right side, so I stopped (4.5 incline 2.5 mph) Thought I would increase by 30 sec to min going forward if I could.  Went back today.  Didn't feel any pain, but stopped at 25 min.  Now its 2 hours later and my left back is tightening and hurting.

Maybe I decided on wrong thing.  What is the fastest way to get core muscles strengthened?  The gym has free weights, nautilus, pool.  All manner of stair steppers, ellipticals, rowing, bikes, a machine that looks like a stepper but moves in a roundish pattern. I also am not adverse to yoga if that is something that would be the most beneficial.  Floor exercises, fine.

So, what do you got?  What you think is the quickest? And what is a reasonable amount of time to see results?   I'm about 40 lbs overweight, and doing keto (dropped about 30) because I know the weight adds to the issue.  

Is there anything after your workout you do that is beneficial?  Steam, sauna, jacuzzi?",AllTheBullshitAnon,self.Exercise,1565845918

Just a couple days ago I changed my diet and workout routine drastically in order to get ready for soccer (I’m playing collegiately so the workouts are pretty intense)

Two days ago I did the Manchester United test, yesterday I did 4 miles on the treadmill at a decent pace I think I finished around 26-28 minutes, and then today I did 3 miles and a slow pace and worked out in between each mile...

My diet consisted of (in the same order), a chicken salad and smoothie for lunch and dinner, smoothie had no protein just fruit and water, if that’s even a smoothie, next day I had another smoothie and chipotle 3 pointer just chicken and rice that’s it, today I had eggs and then Asian bbq salmon and that was it. 

I feel very shaky, my heart feels super heavy and I am extremely dizzy, I’ve been drinking a ton of water but it’s not helping at all. Is this normal for someone who changed their diet/exercise routine? I wouldn’t say I changed it drastically, but there was normally less running at a slower pace, more lifting, and more food.

Exercise,What workout would be best for me ?,"Hi guys 	!

So, a little backstory - I am absolutely not fit. I am a 17 y/o female, about 148cm and I weigh 60kg. I haven’t exercised in a year due to exams and i hate how out of shape I am, how I can’t run or jump or anything without being out of breath and in pain after a couple of seconds. It’s pathetic. 

As an indicator of how “fit” I am: sixty seconds of on the spot running and I’m out of breath. I can manage about twenty crunches in a row, and like one press up haha. 

In September I want to go back to volleyball, and I want to get good enough to potentially play for my uni when I go to uni. To do that, i will need to be in shape enough to run and jump etc. So.. as someone who has absolutely no idea how to exercise, what should I do? I don’t have access to a gym so will have to be home workouts. I also don’t have any weights. If you guys could suggest some specific routines and maybe even some dietary recommendations, that’d be great ! (Looking more for workout routines than food stuff tho)

Currently I’m doing 60 seconds running on the spot, 50 star jumps, 40 seconds walk sit, 30 seconds plank, 20 crunches and then ten stretches to finish it off. This is just a random routine I cobbled together and I’m aware that it’s probably not enough and the exercises I chose are likely not very effective.

Exercise,Old fart on treadmill -- seems good way to improve stamina -- just hanging on a little longer.,"A long ago I ran a variety of marathons in Hawaii and in Portland, Oregon.

I remember that when I started running I thought I was in pain, could not do it, etc. And so I jogged past a telephone as long as I could and then walked to the next pole. I did this day after day and was able to run much further and completed more than 15 marathons.

Now at seventy I today am learning lessons from my past.

On my treadmill today rather than walking at 1.5 mph I walked at 1.8 mph and at 7.5 minutes is was exhausted and took a break (I was sweaty and breathing hard). When I stopped I turned off my watches timer and continued to read in my book for about a page and a half and then completed 30 minutes of heavy workout, turning my watch timer off When I was not walking. (I also wear ankle weights and breathe every fourth step.)

At any rate I think I now have the means to systematically get better and it does not seem too difficult.

I believe if I do this for a month or two my stamina will be much higher, like jogging past telephone poles, which I did three decades ago.

I have run marathons. But I am at an ""I fucking hate running"" place in my life. However, my body is adapted to that level of fitness and anything less and my body will pack on pounds. In fact, let's be honest, at 139, it already has. That's Hashimoto's. Yes. I have my thyroid levels tested regularly, am on Synthroid and my bloodwork has been within normal limits for 3 years now.

Exercise,"Desperately seeking help in exercising. I don't know where to start, or even what to do.","Pretty much what the title is, is the TL;DR.  And this post will probably be all over the place, so please bear with me.

I need help.  I need a lot of help.  I am nearing 300 LBS, and I am struggling to even start a routine to get fit.  I know, I know ""Diet helps the most."".  I get it, I really do.  But I have trouble stopping my self from eating.  I have moderation control issues when it comes to food and snacks.

I just visited my doctor earlier to day for my yearly physical, and I talked with him about starting to do a few things to lose weight so I can sleep better, and have more energy, but I honestly don't know exactly where to start.

To put things simply, I work third shift.  I leave the house at 4 PM, and don't get back until 3-6 AM, and I do this from Sunday to Thursday.  So, by the time Friday rolls around, I'm getting home in the early hours of the day, and sleeping until 12-2 PM.  So, I honestly have a hard time setting a schedule to actually work out.  My job is building, and pulling pallets of upwards 500 LBS+ while rushing through the ware house, so I am also exhausted by the time I get home.

I keep thinking to my self ""I should do some push ups."", but then never get around to doing them.  I think about it, but never do it.  It always starts that way though.  ""I should do this."" but don't actually do it until I forget about it.  I am done with that, and want to better my life, now.

I also am VERY self conscious about doing any exercise thanks to my brothers always making remarks whenever I tried to do ANYTHING that wasn't ""normal"" as in sit around the house watching TV.  Hell, I even went outside to do stuff, but had a very, very hard time to actually do them, even though it was 3 in the morning, and I was completely alone, my wife and son asleep in side.

While I was outside, I did a bunch of googling to find beginner stuff, and I found squats.  After hyping my self up to even attempt to do them, I couldn't do them.  Simply couldn't thanks to knee pain.  I go down like how it shows, and my knee hurts.  Did some more googling, and I found that push ups are good.  I can't do many of them, so I used the outside steps to elevate a bit to make them easier and managed to do 3 sets of 5.  Felt slightly better, but hesitant about doing more because of ""what if some one sees me and says something.""

Looked more online, and found lunges.  Again, same thing.  Managed to do 3 sets of 5 on each leg.  And now my legs are shaky, very shaky.  But, it was easy just to do those, even if I felt silly doing them outside and again ""what if some one saw me.""

I also know about walking, and I am trying to do more of it from besides all the jogging I do at work.

So, all I'm able to do is 3 sets of 5 push ups with using something to elevate my self, and 3 sets of 5 squats each leg.  

I know this one was pretty much all over the place, but I guess I'm kind of looking for validation as well.  Something to help me get to do it every day.

I'm also looking for people to give me advice on what else I can do as a literal beginner for exercise.  I don't live in a big place, so there isn't a lot of room for me to do some stuff.  Does anyone have any resources to help a beginner get into doing it, and to keep doing it?

Also, on a side note, is it ok to do lunges and push ups multiple times a day, every day?  I know I don't want to strain my self just starting out, so I won't do it if it's not good to do.",StrangerFeelings,self.Exercise,1564820273

Exercise,Advice on exercising/exercise schedule and dieting,"Hello everyone! I am a beginner at this, and I wanted to see what advice the fitness community could give to a beginner like me, so here I am.

For starters: I am a boy. I am 14 yrs old, and I weigh 106lbs, and 5'8. I want to build up some muscle, loose my belly fat, and gain some weight (goal is 120lbs) healthily.

My exercise schedule consists of this: 

Monday: Leg day- Exercises include squats, lunges, running, walking, mountain climbers, and back squats. When I am not doing walking or running, I am doing 25-50 reps of exercise for 1hr. 

Tuesday and Thursday: Core Day- Exercises include sit-ups, crunches, planks, deadbugs, and the half kneeling wood chop. Both days last a minimum of 30 min, and maximum an hour. So it is 1-2 hrs of core exercise per week.

Friday: Arm day- Exercises include lifting 5-10lb weights, planks, and push ups. I do these exercises for one hour.

Wedsnday and Saturday: Break days, no exercise.

Saturday: Aerobics- Exercises include running, walking, cycling, jumping jacks, burpees and squats.

(Note: I have only done Wedsnday.)

Diet: I eat somewhat unhealthy, as mealtime normally consists of processed foods and frozen foods/dairy. However, I am trying to make it a habit of eating 1 fruit a day, and I am starting to eat salads.

Any and all advice is welcome. P.s. if you could suggest any exercises to add to my daily routine, that would be extremely helpful as I have little idea to what exercises I should do, and what exercises are effective.",Randomusername919192,self.Exercise,1564609571

The most consistent I've ever been with exercise though, was a small period of about a month in which I went to a gym everyday at around 7:30 am. I feel like exercise in the morning fits me better, because you get it out of the way quickly, you can't really think about it, you just wake up and go. And afterwards you don't even feel tired, you stay super energized for the rest of the day (at least that's how remember feeling*).*

Even though I consider myself a night owl rather than a morning person, I feel like it's easier to do first thing in the morning. After a while it didn't even felt like I was loosing time of the day at all, in fact, my days began to feel longer, it felt as if I actually had more time than before I began with the short lived habit.

But currently I have school in the morning, and I don't know if trying to fit a workout before 7am would be pushing it too far for me. What do you prefer, a really early workout or one after midday?",Verebeth,self.Exercise,1564110637

So, basically, I’m an 18 year old female who hasn’t really exercised a day in her life. Thankfully, I’m not overweight (129 lbs and 5’3) but the fact I live an unhealthy life does bother me. Also I have some mental health stuff and I’ve read exercise can help with that so I’d love to get off the couch. 
However, I come from a very athletic family and I’ve tried all sorts of activities  (swimming, weights, yoga, basketball, dance, random classes at the gym, etc) in the past and nothing ever sticks- I just can’t commit because I don’t enjoy it. 
I do, however, walk around the neighborhood at least once a week to get out the house. I’ve found I enjoy it and I’m kind of thinking about trying jogging since I don’t find going around my neighborhood boring. Also, that way my family doesn’t have to get involved because I don’t want their expectations placed on me again. 
My question is: is only running an okay form of exercise? I’m really ignorant about these kinds of things. I’ve heard you’re supposed to balance strength training and running and whatnot... if I’m just looking to be active can I just skip that?

Exercise,Advice for starting an exercise routine,"Right now I walk. I live downtown and pretty much everything is in walking distance - including my job. I also have a husky - we go on frequent walks during the day. They tend to be shorter right now because of the heat. 

I’d like to add on to it with some weight training, yoga, Pilates, etc. but I don’t know where/how to start. I have a really nice gym in my building but I’m kind of intimidated by the weight machines. And there’s the whole “weight training diet” I’ve heard about from friends who do it daily. Do I need to start subscribing to that?

I’m not looking to lose weight - just tone up. I’ve suffered from depression and I know there are a ton of benefits of exercising. I’d like to have more definition in my arms, abs, and thighs. Some core exercises have proven to be difficult as I have some mild lower back issues.

Exercise,Leg muscles without increasing heartrate,"A little bit of simple medical background to see where my question comes from:

I was diagnosed with a disease (POTS) a while ago. Very oversimplification: POTS means you are allergic to gravity. With this disease, my heartrate increases tremendously when standing or sitting. It is generally unknown where it comes from, it is still a very unknown disease. It causes all kinds of symptoms that make it hard for me to go out of the house so every exercise I do has to be at home. My body just will protest if i tried going to a gym. 

One of the tips I come across a lot, is to train my leg muscles. This will reduce the amount of blood 'getting stuck' in my lower limbs. Great plan!

However as i previously mentioned, my heartrate skyrockets when I am standing or sitting (easily over 130 without any exercise. Easily over 150 with light activity like walking the stairs).

I do want to train my leg muscles and I do love working out, but it has to be done while laying down and/or without a significant increase in heartrate. I do not have any ideas really as to what exercises would help me.",Gymlover2002,self.Exercise,1563382925

Exercise,Heart Rate questions,"Heya. 

Does a higher heart-rate in itself do anything for fat loss/muscle building/any positive benefit or is it just an indicator of how much you're exerting? Probably just the latter, right? Does the heart increase in strength, can you build heart (valve?) muscle? If so, what exactly does that do, pump blood stronger? That seems both good and bad...

I'm unable to break 155-160 HR, no matter the exertion level, anymore, due to I guess being too fit - does that matter at all? I was always taught/read you want to be in the 170-180 range (for my age) for best gains, or was that simply a guideline to ensure you're putting your all into the workout? I kinda miss that level of heart-pounding, gasping for air... Now I know how to breathe too well. 

Ancillary questions: Are endorphins relaxing or exciting? I've noticed I have more energy the more sore I am, well, when I break through mentally the initial ""oh god everything hurts"". Is it endorphins or adrenaline making me smile uncontrollably and want to laugh as I push through every muscle going  oh fuck fine let's go? The chemicals from exercise are more fun than any drug.

Does increased muscle mass put more strain on joints? Can joints themselves be strengthened, do tendons and ligaments get stronger - through exercise, just nutrition, both? 

Have you noticed people becoming jealous, fearful or assuming you're stupid, the more muscle you put on? It sucks, it's just so fun to exercise and push yourself, I don't even care about the fitness or muscle aspect...

At the moment I've resorted to using a playlist with a single 30 second song, with a (roughly) 90 second song inbetween, but this limits options. If there was an app which allowed spotify to automatically skip to the next song after a certain amount of time that would be really helpful.

Currently, I'm doing a 10 minute mile daily for my cardio. My first goal is to do 2 miles in 20 minutes daily. I'd like to get to that point and then up the ante on Tuesday/Thursdays with cardio. Probably moving to 3 or 4 miles those days, while keeping to 2 miles Monday, Wed, Fri.

I don't go too hard with weight lifting. I just try to do more on occasion, but without hurting myself. I dont want to become this huge buff woman. More like reach a point that I like my muscles and then maintain.

My real question is about the cardio. Is this a sustainable workout? Are there underlying risks I'm taking by running this much? Should I be doing something different?

2. Cook and eat by 6pm.
3. Usually pretty busy with life stuff 6-10. Time with husband, TV, going out to do stuff. 
4. Relax in bed 10-11 and go to sleep at 11.

I have home exercise equipment: Treadmill, exercise bike, a bowflex.

So I'm overweight and just found out I have very low T which has contributed to the weight gain and inability to lose weight. I also have pretty bad, low, ""good cholesterol"" and the doctor said I really need to exercise more and I can't just sit at my desk 12 hours a day and should get up and stretch for a few minutes every hour. Especially because my new meds cause thick blood which can contribute to blood clots. 

This scares me because I have family history of heart attacks and heart problems. 

Since I don't have a ton of time what I have been doing is:

1. Work 5am-7am
2. 20 mins of cardio (about 200 calories) 
3. Every hour of work I take a 5 min break and walk briskly/bike quickly for cardio (about 45 calories each time) - instead of just stretching in front of my desk 
4. Sometimes I can squeeze in another 20-30 mins in the evenings. 

That gives me 20 mins in the morning and about 40 mins sporadically throughout the day.

My main question is... Is that 40 mins sporadically OK or should I just be stretching and doing an additional 30 mins I can probably squeeze in during the evenings? Will the 40 mins sporadically help me lose weight by burning calories or does 5 mins not get the body going enough to actually contribute?",jetteh22,self.Exercise,1562776324

Exercise,"Benefit of holding onto treadmill, extending arms?","These past few months, I finally started going to the gym on a regular basis, so I am still fairly new to the fitness world. My regular cardio workout consists of starting at 5% incline on treadmill, increasing by 1% every minute until I’m at 15% (max) and staying there for 20 minutes (or longer if I can handle it), then decreasing the incline by 1% ~each minute until I’m finished, at about 3.5mph the whole time. I really enjoy this workout and I’ve seen results in my glutes and thighs. Once I hit about 8 or 9% incline, I have to hold onto the top of the treadmill (above the screen) for balance, so that my arms are extended straight forward, which I see many other people do at my gym. I definitely feel energy being exerted in my arms, probably from holding up my own weight to an extent, and my forearms have become more muscular (I don’t do any other arm exercises), so I assumed there was a benefit to doing this and it could be helping work out/tone my arms. However, I recently read that holding onto the pegs or hand rails on a treadmill actually negatively impact the workout due to less exertion in the lower body.

Exercise,Did exercising increase my metabolism?,"TL;DR: I did a hip-hop dance class for a semester and lost 20 pounds. Somehow, even without exercising anymore, I am able to keep the weight off and even continue losing some. Is an increase of metabolism the cause of this?
 
Hello everyone,
F (19) here. I started hip-hop dance in January and it ended in May. The class involved dancing for about an hour and a half, sometimes with only one 1 minute water break; along with practicing for midterms and final dances in between. By March/April I started noticing that I was reaching 185-190 (I had started at 200). By my final dance, I was about 181 (as my very lowest, disregarding that weight fluctuates). During the semester I was pretty spotty with my healthy eating so it's not exactly like I was killing two birds with one stone, but I was still losing. And now that it's July, I am seeing 180 on the scale for the first time since I was 14. 

Bottom line, did doing that much exercise boost my metabolism? Because I haven't really been exercising and most certainly don't always eat right; if anything, I've been laying in bed practically all summer. I would think the stunt in physical activity since May would make me gain again but it's as if my body is set to stay around this weight now. I'm 5'8"" btw in case anyone is curious, so the weight loss has been quite noticable to me since my height holds this weight range decently.",avocadnooo,self.Exercise,1562108992

Exercise,Can't Really Afford Gym Membership - Need to Work Out at Home - Tips?,"# 

Hi, I didn't see any [r/Exercise-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise-specific/) rules, so I hope this isn't against any rules. I'm sure this has been asked before but I didn't want to google it because I wanted to hear from real people, not some website or magazine.

With gas and other costs I can't really afford or make time to go to the gym. I know exercising is a commitment but if I can set aside time at home to do it I'm willing to commit; that cuts out driving time and a monthly fee. Plus I know myself and I worry I'll just pull an ""I'll just go tomorrow"" and never go, but if it's right at home it'll be less easy for me to avoid it. ALSO, my anxiety goes insane at the gym and I end up holding myself back and just staying on a treadmill the whole time. Long story short I've never gotten anything done at the gym. I'd like to try in the future, but I want to get to a point where I'm more comfortable in my skin, and I need to start at home for that.

I'm a male who weighs about 195 pounds, about 30-50 pounds more than I weighed a year ago. The last 10 months or so I started eating a lot more unhealthily, and I've never really had to exercise in my life to keep fit, just got lucky with the metabolism and what not. I've developed a sort of mini-gut and my thighs have gotten bigger.

I wanted tips on what I can do at home on a consistent schedule that will help me get my weight back down to the 140s/150s. I know eating goes very much with exercise, so I'm gonna post in another sub about that.

Any help at all is so appreciated. My weight gain has affected my self-image, anxiety, and depression a lot, and if I can figure this out I know I'll be a lot happier with myself and my life.",boring-ass-throwaway,self.Exercise,1562086368

Exercise,leg stretches?,"Hello! 

I’m just getting back into working out after a 3+ year long period of virtually no exercise. I’ve gone running daily for the past week and a half, with one rest day. Because of my current weight I know that running causes strain on my knees, but I’ve been careful to pace myself and slow to a walk when needed. I’m thinking I should probably take a rest day or just take it easier tomorrow, with a long walk instead of a run. 

But i’ve found i have to pause to stretch my legs a couple times if i’m running. Particularly my shins seem to get really tight. My knees hurt but i think it’s muscle soreness and not injury. I’m also running on a track, which is softer on my knees than pavement.

My question is could I split the doses, For example  take two in the afternoon before a long walk and the taking the last two before my intense workout in the evening?

Exercise,Best way to heal my muscles after working out?,"Honestly, I think there are only two things that make a real difference when it comes to [muscle recovery](https://hvmn.com/blog/training/muscle-recovery-essential-to-your-next-workout). 

1. **Sleep.** Sleep is the only thing absolutely proven to aid recovery time. You also produce most of your [HGH](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/29/1/20/2715789/Growth-Hormone-Secretion-During-Nocturnal-Sleep-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext) during the deep phases of your sleep, so long uninterrupted sleep is needed. Aim for 9–10 hours on your heavy days and at least 8 every day. Wake up at the same time every day if at all possible.
2. **Protein.** If your protein intake is extremely low recovery will definitely be hindered. There is some evidence post workout protein increases recovery, and protein intake in the following 48 hours has a significant factor as well.

Some people will suggest massage, ice baths, Epsom salts, and others, but while some studies suggest they may reduce soreness none has proven to aid recovery.",myrtleeeb,self.Exercise,1562041783

All the places you can walk to, you walk there instead of driving your car and then you start to jog to those places until you can jog all the way to them and all the way back.

Exercise,Alternative Cardio Suggestions,"Hey everyone, first time on this sub and I'm hoping to find some advice. Recently had some medical issues regarding frequent light-headedness and limb numbness/unresponsiveness. Normally healthy and exercised occasionally, but the last 2 years it just kept getting worse and worse. Finally went in to see someone when I obtained health insurance again and have been tentatively (still more tests to do) diagnosed with moderate Orthostatic Hypotension. Essentially, my blood pressure has naturally become super low over time, and most activities that get my heart rate up cause severe dizziness and basically my extremities feel like they are 'asleep'.

I've been trying to find ways to remain somewhat fit, I'm 6'0 190lbs, but outside of some free weights and riding my bike every now and again, I can't do any kind of cardio. I joked at first because I hate cardio anyway, but a stronger heart helps increase blood pressure. 

Looking for some safe tips to do that. Running/jogging can't be done anymore. I've tried and I fall over because of dizziness and my legs stop working and I don't want to get caught in a situation I can't get myself home from. Biking isn't as bad, but it's hard to do on a regular workout routine where I live and I have the same other concerns as above. Open to any ideas, I don't know why I can't think of any that doesn't involve a semi-heavy investment into equipment of any kind. Any tips appreciated!",spooli,self.Exercise,1562010413

Exercise,"Don't be perfect, be consistent...","Consistency is the key to improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

If you work a 9-5, or something similar, the chances are high that all your boss wants out of you is consistency; anything given AFTER that is just a plus.

In anything and everything I do, my primary focus is always on, “How can I be more consistent?""

\- How can I put in consistent lap-times in my racing simulator, instead of the one, ultra-fast lap that I’ll never do again?

\- How can I consistently go viral?

\- How can I consistently execute my build-orders in StarCraft 2?

\- How do I keep a consistent workout schedule?

When it comes to dance, that last one is important, but even MORE important than that is this: how do you keep a consistent dance *style?*

Of course, you want your style to always be evolving, you want to be learning a new move at least once a day or once every *other* day, increasing your dance vocabulary, but how do you keep a style that’s all your own? Most people automatically think it’s this complicated process, but it’s actually quite simple, once you have a process to follow; after that, you’ve just got to put in the time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what’s the key to consistently having a style that’s all your own?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, if you look at guys like [Anthony Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZsz3SLX03A&amp;t=35s), [Ben Cheung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD_kEoLpy5w), and [Joe Larot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo9jxFJNqXM) just to name a couple (always look to the best and analyze what they’re doing right), when they freestyle, you don’t know what specific moves they’re going to do, but we can all agree that there’s a general sense of movement that is uniquely THEIRS; in fact, this was what was so *fun* about watching the Jabbawockeez: even though you couldn’t see their faces and they all looked the same, [the moment one started soloing, you could figure out exactly who was dancing!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJPaLTaRVNE)

&amp;#x200B;

That’s your goal: to be identifiable SOLELY by your own, unique style.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s not about the individual moves, but the overall moveMENT; the *way* in which you combine the individual moves you’ve learned is something that can be uniquely YOURS!

So, during your hourly sessions, focus on creating small sequences of moves that you can easily drill, actually *drill* them without music first, then play some music and see where in the song you can start fitting these sequences. REMEMBER: it’s okay to slightly mess-up at first, have fun with this, and don’t get caught-up or discouraged by *any* small mistakes; if this process were easy, everyone would do it!

This mentality-shift can be also be useful for your hobbies and side hustles, as well as in the regular workplace! You know, if you have a job, a 9-5, 8-5, 7-5, whatever it may be, I’m willing to bet that your boss, no matter what your job is, all he or she wants to see out of you is consistency, because once you’re a consistent employee, you’ve also become a RELIABLE employee, remember that.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this post is dance-specific, so let me know how you can apply this concept to your own exercise and/or daily life! :)",Zerir,self.Exercise,1562000512

Exercise,"Good habits are the foundation to good exercise habits, and a good life.","This morning I brushed my teeth and realized just how important good habits are in life.

The result? I haven’t had a cavity in 15 years and counting! Do you think that’s a coincidence? I sure don’t.

&amp;#x200B;

Good, small habits are the foundation to larger, and even more useful, habits.

Case in point: I used to NOT go to the gym on a regular basis to practice freestyle dancing; when I should've been going every single day, I would instead go every 3-4 days or so.

&amp;#x200B;

The result?

&amp;#x200B;

I stagnated. I'd be doing the same moves as I was doing a month ago, with no improvement; in fact, the OPPOSITE was happening! I was getting worse.

I began to have so much self-doubt, pondering whether I should pursue dance at all...

But today, that all changes. Dance is my passion, and I realize now that passions don't turn into good habits all on their own; they must be CONSCIOUSLY MADE into habits. No one's schedule is too busy to set aside 1 hour a day to exercise.

But then you get a whole load of thicker ones, which range from 1.5cm right up to 5cm. 
Some look soft and padded, some look more solid and springy, rubber/pvc/other materials. All of them claim they are the best for most types of exercise, and they all have great reviews so none of this helps much

I'm turning 40.  Keeping that weight off is hard now.

3 months ago I switched from food service where I was always on my feet and moving to an office job, one that affords the ability to stand at my desk which is nice but isn't doing anything. I had hoped getting away from the restaurant food would be a benefit but the stress of change and life is taking it's toll.

I can feel the weight and see it.

I don't have much time to allocate.  I can dedicate about 30 minutes reasonably during the week but I'm having a hard time solidifying a routine.

I know I need strength training with my cardio and this is where I lose it.

My joints aren't in good shape after a couple of rough accidents and I don't have access to a gym.  I've got free weights and the internet at my disposal.

im an all or nothing kind of guy, so i admit in the past i started out doing exercise that wasnt suitable at all for my current condition, far too intense, and yes i got these symptoms.   
but i started again today and i got these symptoms after a 5 minute jog. if i do exercise that doesnt get my heart rate up, basic house work, lifting and carrying, heavy garden work like digging and moving rocks etc... i don't get this and i feel good, but anything that gets the blood flowing and heart rate up seems to give me these symptoms.   


could i be that im just so so unfit that this is like ""over training"" for me. even though its a 5 minute jog ( albeit a very fast paced jog ;) )  
in the past it has caused me to stop all exercise. and think exercise just isnt for me.

I’m 15 years old (almost 16) and I just finished my freshman year of high school I did two sports which was indoor track and Volleyball. For indoor track I was a sprinter, although many of our practices consisted of 1 to 3 miles runs in the beginning and although it didn’t matter since it was practice I was always behind,last, and always got three before everybody else. For this ik it’s primarily because of my weight because it takes more energy for someone who is 154 pounds to run than someone who is 130 pounds making me tired fast. Long story short. I got a membership at planet fitness but I have NO clue on what to do to lose my body fat and get lean. I would first want to lose the fat, then build on muscle since I’m not too weak. Now, I know most of you are going to say that abs come in your diet, but my mom is mostly in control of what I eat since I can’t drive and don’t really have any money. Anyway How do I lose this body fat and get lean over the summer and what should I do with my diet to make it faster and better. For information I’m about 5’5.5-5’6 and I around 153-156 depending on if I eat, bloated etc. please list any tips,workouts, or diet plans please

Exercise,Results of survey conducted on r/exercise,"[Link to survey post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/bteqan/impact_of_exercise_on_stress_survey/)

The survey was conducted with the hypothesis that ""More exercise leads to lower stress levels because of a better mood that is produced by exercise"".   

The primary variables that were considered were amounts of exercise, amounts of stress and mood. Whether participants felt less stressed during or after exercise and their frequency of work or study related thoughts during exercise were also considered for the purpose of comparing with the findings. The secondary variables were the hours spent on different intensity exercise and proportion of exercise which were sport. However no trends or patterns of the secondary variables could be identified. Hours spent on work or study and occupation were the control variables as it was noted that they could have an impact on stress pattern. Therefore, they were collected in the contingency that they might be taken into consideration so as to maintain a single independent variable. 

The results were that more exercise does indeed lead to lower stress levels, but however is only effective to a certain point, which based on the chart is around 10 to 15 hours. Factors such as time spent on exercise as sport and the intensity of exercise seemed to have no impact on levels of stress.

&amp;#x200B;

[Worrying was one of the factors assessed when measuring stress](https://i.redd.it/pngjfqi5ru431.png)

To reinforce these findings, participant's views were taken into consideration

[Participants own opinions of the impact exercise has on their stress](https://i.redd.it/snwusbnitu431.png)

However the part on mood was rather inconclusive, as there were no clear trends and several abnormalities, such as a sudden spike of 20% to 67% at a point for happiness levels.

Exercise,Truth about exercise that most people ignore,"**That it doesn’t really make you lose your weight.**

  
A typical candy bar contains 250 calories. People get on those treadmills and go running thinking that it’ll burn off that candy bar they ate after breakfast, and then some, and they come off with rock hard abs after a few months.

The truth is much sadder than that.  
Half an hour of running on the treadmill will burn just around 240 calories. Even if you run for half an hour you still have 10 calories left over from that five-minute snack. And this is running — one of the most efficient exercises at burning calories. Lifting weights and other resistance training? They burn a whole lot less.

If running for half an hour barely just get rid of your candy bar snack, what more your breakfast, lunch, and dinner?

You need to spend hours, and I mean hours of time in the gym exercising if you really want to use it to lose weight, and even then if you eat a big dinner afterwards (as a “reward” for your efforts) all that effort just gets wiped out. It’s just not worth it. Nobody has that kind of time unless they’re a fitness instructor or a bum who does nothing all day (and believe me bums have much better things to do with their time).

Exercise contributes, but if you really want to lose weight the correct approach is to fix your diet. Limiting your caloric intake is the real way to lose weight.

2. **Squats:** Specifically jump squats. This would engage my core and lower body while developing explosive strength by activating the fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibers. 
3. **Sprinting.** Another fast twitch activating exercise that develops explosive power, great short burst cardio strength, strong form and overall functionality. Just look at the way high-level sprinters are built and there’s no debate about this exercise.

Exercise,How can someone who goes to the gym regularly to lift weights not be able to do ten pull-ups?,"If you're like me who has been lifting weights for a couple of months already but still can't pull off the pull ups, here's my trainer's explanation.  


Pull-ups are harder and more advanced than what the average people thinks. People keep trying to compare pull ups and push ups when they’re different, but when you do pull-ups you’re literally holding and pulling 95% of your own body weight minus your hands and forearms. When doing push ups, you’re only pushing 65% of your own body weight. People who “lift weights” usually uses like less than 65% of the amount of their own body weight to do things like curls, dumbbell rows, seated cable rows, and even on lat pull down you’d barely use your own body weight and most people who does are usually just forcefully leaning all the way back and yanking on the cable attachment, if they were to do it correctly, they won’t be able to do it because, a lot of the average people at gym doesn’t actually know how to lift weights properly as most of them have never been properly taught and they never bothered to spend time to do research.   


It will take a combination of two things to get your chin up over that bar:

* Decreasing body fat so you have less weight to pick up!
* Increasing strength to pick up your bodyweight and move above the bar!

Exercise,Cardio vs. weightlifting: which is more effective in burning fat?,"Definitely, it's weightlifting. During a fat loss phase, your workouts should be designed to keep muscle and strength. Lightweights for a ton of reps isn’t going to help your cause. Lifting heavy on the big lifts (squats, deadlifts, barbell shoulder press, rows) during a fat loss period tells your body to spare muscles because they needed to move the weight. Going the lightweight route, your body sees no need for the extra muscle. All your hard work to gain it was a complete waste of time.

Cardio, on the other hand, is a double-edged sword. Here’s why:

Your body wants to be efficient. 

A 15-minute run done week one will burn more calories than the same 15 minute run week two. That 15-minute run on week two will burn more calories than on week three. As you do more cardio your body becomes more efficient at producing the energy needed for the run. To get the same calorie burn in week three as you did in week one, you’d have to either run faster for the same amount of time or run for a longer duration at the same speed. Also known as the [overloading principle](https://hvmn.com/blog/training/overload-principle-training-with-purpose).

Focus on getting a calorie deficit from your diet first. Next, keep your workouts heavy. Finally, when you can’t (or don’t want to) lower calories anymore, that’s when you add in cardio.",myrtleeeb,self.Exercise,1560451000

For the next few days after, I was sore like I never have been. It hurt to both straighten and bend my arms. I figured it was just DOMS and I would be able to return to the gym a week later but when I got there, I was unable to lift the same weight at all. Even one rep was impossible without a great amount of momentum, compared to the previous week where I did various sets with no problem.

There’s absolutely no tightness when my arms are relaxed, straightened, or bent, just a strange amount of weakness that I can’t overcome without extreme momentum.

I want to be like them and get fit, but I don’t know how. The most exercise I get are little dance parties I like to have with myself every once and a while. But everyone loves jogging (apparently) which looks fun and convenient, but it is so painful for me. I get the ache in my sides really quickly (floating rib I think is what it’s called?) and it’s hard to breathe and it is just so NOT the kind of fun everyone says it is. I also find it hard to climb a lot of stairs and I get winded easily. 

I’m a musician and currently have tendinitis, so I’ve been in a rut bc I can’t play and that is my outlet and how I survive (mentally). This is why I am trying just now. 

Also I will note I look in shape and am happy with my body, I’m not doing this for weight reasons. Most people think I do exercise and are surprised when I tell them I don’t, it’s just I have so little actual muscle on me 😬

On a good day, taking yesterday for example: I ate a small bowl of porridge, had a latte and went to the gym. I did 90 minutes of cardio, came home, had a protein shake and then some fish for dinner. I try and sit at about 1000kcal a day and I like to burn 75 to 100% of what I eat.

Today, I was in a rush, so I just had a latte and went to the gym. I felt uncomfortable cycling because my legs and butt still hurt from the previous day.

I’m not afraid of people seeing me or anything I’m actually afraid of the act itself because of falling. 

I have a huge falling phobia and I’ve broken my ankles multiple times from walking and once from jogging in junior high. It’s always because of rolling my ankle. I roll my ankle all the dang time. It gets to the point where if I’m doing some activity with friends that involves jogging at any speed i will sit out or refuse to do it cause I’m scared of falling. 

I really want to be able to run without this fear or a solution so I can’t roll my ankles at all. I’ve done athletic tape on my foot and ankle while hiking and loved that, but I live in the Texas heat and that’s just not comfortable enough for jogging in the summer here.

Exercise,"Combining running, stretching and some calisthenics into one training session?"," 

Here is the thing: I try to built a routine  of going to the sports field every other day. Currently I'm doing mainly  cardio: I usually run 10 to 15 laps, which is my current point of  exhaustion for cardio. After that I do some stretching exercises.

That  public sports facility also has a smaller area with all the various  bars and stuff for calisthenics exercises. So I thought: when I'm  already there, why not add some calisthenics after I did my cardio?  Since I can only afford to go there every other day, I would like to do a  combined training session rather than having separate training days for  strength training / calisthenics.

My  focus is clearly on the cardio / running part. But would it be feasible  and beneficial to maybe add a calisthenics routine of 15 - 20 minutes  after I took a short break and cooled of from the cardio training? I  just want to do a small routine of strength training and then do my  stretching exercises. Would that be a good order and time frame:

1. 30 minutes cardio
2. 10 minutes cooling down break
3. 15 minutes calisthenics
4. 5 minutes stretching

Exercise,Recommendations for a gym routine to lose weight (Cardio-wise),"Hello, this will be my first post here and hopefully not my last. 

As it stands I’m already pretty obese however I love my sports, I’m an avid badminton player, rubbish at basketball and even worse at cycling. I’d like to think that with all this I’d be slim as fuck but my diet and eating habits really do bring me down. Especially during exams season where I consume copious amounts of sugary products, energy drinks and (sometimes) alcohol to study for long and just make it through. Now exams seasons over, I’ve started going to the gym mainly to do cardio because I already have a weight set a home I regularly use (except in exam season...).

As it stands my current routine for the past two weeks has been :
10x 1000 on the rowing machines

4 x 5km  on the Exercise bikes with like 5-7 resistance 

And whatever really floats my boat for a like 30 minutes.

As much as I like the variety of exercising I have a target weight I want to reach by the end of august at 90&lt;x&lt;100kg and my current weight is 116kg so I’ve forced myself to eat healthier and utilise my free time more by exercising but I also want to be efficient with this so I was wondering if anyone would be able to recommend  a routine that would help toward maximising my weight loss also any tips that could help a dumbass like me achieve his goal.

Exercise,Tingling/Ripping Sensation When Lifting,"Hey! 

I've (27M) have been exercising very casually on and off for years. I've been wanting to get more into regular excercising but I keep having the same issue when doing dumbell bicep curls. Basically when I'm lifting in usually my second or third set I will start to feel almost a ripping/tingling feeling in my bicep or upper forearm. I'm able to fully control the weight so it's not that I'm trying to overexert myself. This usually starts to happen after I've gotten some reps in. I usually stop when I start to feel this but I feel I won't progress if I stop lifting. I keep my reps under 10 each time and I have the weight at a level where I struggle at the end of the reps but I'm still able to lift the weight. 

Any ideas what this might be due to? Any suggestions to deal with this? I've only experienced this feeling when doing bicep curls.

I am big into any type of exercise; lifting, running, cycling, swimming, sports, yoga, etc. I have never had a major injury in my life, but experienced achilles tendonitis due to what I believe was overuse. I had been running long distances in pursuit of completing a marathon (17 miles was my top) as well as lots of yoga and some cycling. Due to this injury, I took a month and half off from any form of running and most of cycling, which to be frank, drove me absolutely crazy. Running is by far my favorite aerobic exercise and cycling/swimming do not satisfy that desire. I guess what I am looking for is ways the recover, not only muscles but tendons, joints, etc., to prevent any type of overuse injury. I would love to hear other peoples recovery routines and have a discussion about improvements in recovery.

I have tried almost every form of exercise possible, swimming, running, biking (indoor and outdoor), pilates/yoga, weight lifting, rock climbing, hiking, you name it I have tried it.

The thing is, I never feel good after workouts, nor do I get that ""rush"" people talk about. I've been in situations where I've pushed myself so hard that I puked, and situations where it was light exercise, and either way, I just hate it. I hate every second of it. When it is over I feel relief because I do not have to do it again for another day.

At first I thought it may have to do with the meds I am on (I take opiates for herniated discs) but I recalled that I felt like this long before I was on meds and before my injuries. I was on a swim team in my youth and I remember just kind of hating it then too.

My problem is that it is getting to a point where I legitimately just can't force myself to do it anymore. I don't want to. I don't want to use my time at a gym. I want to sit around. I know it will kill me younger if I stop it, but doing something that you absolutely loathe makes it harder.

Exercise,I pushed myself too hard yesterday.,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to let you know that there is such a thing as pushing yourself too hard. Let me tell you my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I decided to mountain bike and did so for a little over an hour. My heart rate came close to my max heart rate multiple times and I was truly pushing myself. I am really conditioned so my workout although really tough was not causing my heart to feel like it was going to explode. I was not dizzy or anything else crazy. My body could seemingly handle it. So I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, flash forward to today and I am dazed and tired like. I feel unmotivated and tired all day today. My brain does not seem to be responding well. I am not registering things as fast and cannot wrap my head around learning or doing complex tasks. It is almost like a brain fog. I have had a blank stare and been emotionless all day today. My sleep last night was good too.

&amp;#x200B;

I have learned that 1 hour of constant pushing myself is an unwise move. In fact, I find it hard to believe how it is healthy for anyone based on the scientific consensus of how much exercise we should be doing. The mind may be willing but the body may not be able to handle the stresses you put on it.",HaxusPrime,self.Exercise,1558991566

I’ve been rowing for 10 years so I have very strong quads and I am finding it very difficult to teach myself to engage my glutes. I actively tried to use them over my 15 km hike yesterday but it felt very awkward. Aside from the bridge exercise that my physio gave me, what else can I do to teach my body to engage my glutes?

Exercise,Should you STOP! DOING THE PLANK IF YOU’RE OVER 50?," STOP! DOING THE PLANK IF YOU’RE OVER 50!   
⠀  
This was the provocative headline a social media page with a major influential presence posted last week.  
⠀  
We (along with many others) approached her both in the comments and privately in DMs expressing concern about the inaccurate information and its’ effect on the thousands of women who would read it. Kim Schlag &amp; I contacted multiple pelvic health experts and had them weigh in.  
⠀  
The original poster later updated the post to add some context, stating “the plank exercise puts pressure on the bladder, which may already be weakened without the influence of oestrogen. To prevent further damage modify the plank position by resting knees on the floor, or speak with your instructor about alternative positions.   
⠀  
Yet her stance remained firm, in all her comments and interaction on the post, she stood by her claim that women should stop doing plank after 50 and did not even mention the possibility of strengthening the muscles to progress to doing plank.  
⠀  
Women over 50 were up in arms at being told they SHOULD NOT do an exercise! And came out in droves to fight against this.   
⠀  
So, what’s the deal? What do the experts say about the safety &amp; benefit of planking for women 50+? Well the best way to handle bad information is to give you correct information.  
⠀  
I co-authored an article for you breaking down exactly what you need to know (link in bio as well as in the highlights above.) You’ll learn:  
⠀  
What the pelvic floor is &amp; how it works.  
How menopause may affect your PF &amp; what you can do about it  
How to tell if planks are an appropriate exercise for YOU  
How to do a good plank  
⠀  
Remember this: No matter what your age you are not fragile. There is no such thing as an exercise for 20 year olds and an exercise for 50 year old.

I was wondering if anyone else is like this? It has been years and as i get older i feel more and more like i just dont want to do it any more because i get 0 enjoyment from it. i find myself watching the clock until my workout ends.

I've tried basically every exercise i can think of. Running, ellyptical, outdoor biking, indoor biking, swimming, yoga, pilates, zumba classes, kick boxing, rock climbing, hiking, and nothing is enjoyable. i keep thinking to myself 'i cannot wait for this to end'. The only one i do not do is weight lifting because of my back issues as you will see below.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on a bunch of meds (opiates) for a herniated back discs, honestly i think my exercise is probably what allows me to move as easily as i do, because according to my doctor i should be far worse off, but i just hate every second of it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else feel like this, like you are just trudging through it? could meds be the reason i do not feel good after it?

So I don't know how low I should squat, some people tell me I should make my hamstrings touch my calf muscles. While my physiotherapist tells me the angle should be 90 degrees between the hamstring and calf muscles.

I don't make my hamstrings touch because I noticed it gives off a posterior pelvic tilt or a ""butt wink"". I get very unsettled by this tilt and I'm not sure if its a mobility issue or the tilt being beyond my lowest depth. 

If anyone has thoughts on this, I'm happy to receive feedback and I'm thankful for it.",MachineYZG,self.Exercise,1558402177
Exercise,I am a beginner with bad form.,"Hello,
I joined a gym very recently and so far went to an hour long class yesterday and today. I heard that having bad form during exercise is not good for you and can hinder your progress (or much worse).

Exercise,A year since I started working out,"Today marks my first year since I started my fitness journey and I want to share with you especially for newbies like me the things I've learned and the things that have worked for me.

1. EAT &amp; DON'T STARVE YOURSELF - So many fitness hacks videos/discussions are basically telling you to starve yourself. Don't do this. YOU NEED TO EAT. And what I mean by that is eating for your goal. Everyone's calorie intake is different whether you're trying to do fat loss, weight loss, or trying to gain muscle. Don't try to copy someone else's macros. There are some calculators available online that will calculate your macronutrients and calorie intake depending on your goal.
2. DRINK WATER. Period. Stop drinking soda or sugary drinks and just drink water.
3. CHANGE YOUR MINDSET. If you don't change your mindset and start thinking that fitness is a lifestyle instead of a punishment then you're not gonna be successful. Food should not be a source of guilt or anxiety. It should be what you need to fuel your body so you can feel good and live the life you want to live.
4. NO GYM? NO PROBLEM. Train from your home, hotel, office, backyard, anywhere. There are so many workout apps available today that you can use as a guide. You can also do body weight exercises and outdoor activities such as running.
5. SCHEDULE YOUR WORKOUTS. Make appointments with yourself to workout, at a specific time and place, just as you would with any other appointment. This way you don't make excuses to skip workouts and you are more likely to make it a habit. Consistency makes habits more ingrained.

Feel free to share your fitness tips and hacks with me! I'd love to hear them.",myrtleeeb,self.Exercise,1558356314
Exercise,Squats causing lower back pain,"I've just started exercising and I've been doing body weight squats everyday, increasing by 5 everyday (up to 150 a day now), and the last couple of days doing them has caused a pretty bad pain in my lower back (lumbar area) that doesn't go away with rest.

Exercise,Proportional Caloric Burn,"This is kind of a technical question, not sure if this is right place to ask, but... I’m curious about the relative difference in energy required between two “opposite” body types, say:

- 5’4” 125 lb, genetically slender (thin frame/smaller features/skinnier throughout) female
- 6’4” 250 lb, genetically thicker (bulkier/broad shoulder, barrel chest/legs) male

I know the numbers I provided indicate different overall fitness levels, but I’m hoping to compare under the assumption that they’re both eating and exercising at “healthy levels” relative to their body type. Imagine they’re near same age, sex, body type, activity level, nutrition, etc... as much as that is possible.

SO, they both briskly walk 3 miles, along the same path, at about 3 mph. About how many more calories does the man burn compared to the woman???",phyitbos,self.Exercise,1558066855

Exercise,Guidance needed,"I'm a 35 year old male. 220 lbs, very active in young years, got a desk job out of college and haven't worked out or stayed in shape since. Time to straighten this out and get in shape. My motivation is there where it has never been before so I think the mental hurdle is cleared.

I started by doing pushups situps and squats to build a base, get my muscles used to working out. From the few times I have went to the gym with friends what always happens is I go once and I hurt for literally 2 weeks and can't go again in that time. So it's been about 3 weeks now and I feel like my base is there, I can do 100 push ups (in smaller groups lol) and not hurt the next day.

Now looking forward I'm about to grab a gym membership and start seriously working out. My goal is not to lose weight but to build muscle as I feel it's more beneficial to overall health to have a muscular frame, more calories burned at resting rate things like that. Running is a short term fix that doesn't help keep weight off.

I've also taken steps to improve my diet, I'm in no way eating a perfect diet but I've cut out soda and fries, i'm eating grilled instead of fried things. Cooking at home more, more meat/veggies rather than cheese steaks.

Here's where I need advice, i'm clueless about this whole world. Give me the once over.

Should I be looking to do more reps with less weight? Or should I focus on getting 3 sets of 10 in with the max weight possible?

What should I be focusing on diet wise to help the muscles grow? People drink things before and after workouts, should I be concerned with trying to do that?

How do rest periods work, at first I was doing each of the items every day, but then realized with a day of rest inbetween I felt like I could do more. Should I be looking for 1 day of rest for a muscle group or is 2-3 better?

Maybe give me a short list of exercises I can look up to do, I don't know how half of those machines work and all I've done is what I've listed above.  I need to craft a weekly routine to cover all the groups and don't know where to start. I'm willing to work out 6 days a week until I reach my goals.

Nutrition people keep screaming eat as much protein as possible while weight training, is this really a big deal? Should I go to the extent of cutting some veggies to make room for more meat?

I know this all makes me sound silly but I'm eager and willing and just need some help. Thanks!",kyle_knightmare,self.Exercise,1558054118

Exercise,Looking for some advice.,"So I'm currently 4ft 10 female and weigh 145 lbs. I'm calorie counting but between weight gain (my highest weight was 175), a car accident in 2008 that blew a disc in my upper spine and a complicated childbirth in 2016 that left spinal damage in my lower spine, I feel a lot older than 31.

Doctor gave me the green light to exercise to make the muscles around the spine stronger to help with pain and weakness but other than essentially  ""Do it"",  gave me no other suggestions on how to.

So I'm looking for a low impact exercise to help me burn off some calories because 1200 is definitely not plenty and strengthen my back so I could keep up with my little girl and not go down the path of back surgeries and knee Replacements that many of my family members did.

I'm taking this as a sign I either do something or I know what my future is going to hold. I've seen it and it's not pleasant.

So where do I start. I have no weights or equipment and I'm a stay-at-home mom with my two-and-a-half-year-old.

Exercise,4 Ways to Boost Your Natural Testosterone Levels," 

When it comes to hormones, testosterone is considered the king hormone. In males, testosterone is produced mainly in the testicles. In women, testosterone is produced in the ovaries although in much smaller amounts. Testosterone production in the body begins significantly increasing in the late teens and starts to decline after the age of 30. Testosterone is the primary sex hormone, and it has a huge effect on your muscle mass and bone density, body fat levels, mood and red blood cell production.

Low testosterone levels can cause a wide variety of symptoms including weight gain, low sex drive, low energy, depression and low self-esteem. While testosterone levels naturally decline as you age, there are multiple ways you can boost your testosterone levels to maintain optimal levels of this critical hormone.

**Signs &amp; Symptoms of Low-Testosterone:**

**(in Men)**

* Little interest in sex (low libido)
* Unable to sustain or get an erection
* Unable to build muscle
* Depression
* Lethargy, weakness &amp; overall low energy levels
* Inability to concentrate
* Low motivation
* Unexpected weight gain
* Hair loss
* Decreased strength during exercise
* Signs of gynecomastia, an abnormal increase in breast tissue size

**(in Women)**

* Fatigue
* Depression
* Declining muscle and bone mass
* Difficulty concentrating
* Weight gain
* Painful intercourse

If you're experiencing at least 3 of the above symptoms on a consistent basis, meaning they're present daily, and you've been experiencing them for more than a few weeks, go see your doctor for a testosterone level blood test, then adopt the following steps...

**How to Boost Your Natural Testosterone Levels:**

* **Reduce Your Stress Levels**

In today's fast paced, hurried society, reducing your stress levels can be easier said than done. We worry about our jobs and children and we stress over finances and relationships. Research has shown that being chronically stressed out increases your cortisol levels. Cortisol is a stress hormone that your body releases in small amounts during the day in response to different stimulus. However, chronically elevated cortisol levels can quickly cause your testosterone levels to plummet.

* **Get Plenty of Sunshine (Vitamin D)**

Vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin. Along with having numerous health benefits including helping with weight loss, it may also work as a natural testosterone booster according to a study done by German researchers. Ideally, you'll want to get at lest 20 minutes of sun exposure per day to optimize your body's Vitamin D levels.

If you live in the far north in a climate without much regular direct sunshine and getting daily sun exposure is not realistic for you, I highly recommend that you supplement with a quality Vitamin D product.

* **Supplement with Fenugreek**

Fenugreek is a plant that's been used in alternative and Chinese medicine to treat various health conditions. Fenugreek is a plant that grows in the forest with pods that contain small brown-golden fenugreek seeds. It's commonly used as a spice and sometimes found in personal care products such as shampoo and soap.

Fenugreek is a good source of several important nutrients, but its beneficial effects are used primarily for testosterone and libido boosting purposes. In one study, researchers provided 500 mg of fenugreek per day to 30 college-aged men. The men combined fenugreek with an 8-week weight lifting program and performed four training sessions per week, with half of them receiving the supplement.

When researchers compared the fenugreek supplement group to the non-supplement group, they noted a slight decline in testosterone in the non-supplement group and an increase in testosterone in the fenugreek group. The fenugreek supplement group also experienced a 2% reduction in body fat.

* **Don't Shy Away from Meat, Eggs and Butter**

Meat, especially red meat, if it's one of the leaner varieties such as sirloin, top round or London broil, is an excellent testosterone booster. This is because red meat is rich in cholesterol, and cholesterol is a direct precursor to testosterone in your body. As with any other food, it's important to choose only the highest quality meat you can find at the grocery store, this means grass fed is a must and organic if possible.

Regular or conventional beef does not have the same health benefits as grass fed beef due to the difference in feed between feed-lot cows and pasture or grass-fed cows. Just like lean red meat, eggs are an excellent source of saturated fat and cholesterol which help boost your natural testosterone levels.",GetFitInLife,self.Exercise,1557723396

Exercise,Mountain Biked Today - My Impressions (spoiler: I did not like it),"Hello all, I just finished mountain biking for about 4 hours today. Let me say that I came into today thinking I would do pretty damn good. I was wrong. Mountain biking today beat me the hell up.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to mountain biking today I have been staying what I believe really active in a healthy and optimal way for the past few months. My resting heart rate has made improvements and I feel much better mentally and physically. I usually hit the stationary bike for 20-25 minutes maybe 4-5 times a week. I incorporate HIIT workouts which has been shown to be the best of both worlds (aerobic and anaerobic). 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I am in shape, mountain biking was absolutely tough. My heart rate must have been pretty much maxed or damn close to it for prolonged lengths of time. I had to get off the bike and walk to catch my breath many times.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, my experience was not so enjoyable. First off, genetically I am programmed moreso for sprinting than for endurance. Second, I did not feel great doing it. Third, and this is a big one, prolonged exercise like what I did today is BAD for your heart. Do it long term and you exceed what our bodies and ancestors were optimally primed for. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me I find about one minute of all out effort followed by a rest period, done multiple times is best for me. Some people are designed for more, some less. Certainly no one is made for marathon races or pushing your heart way up there for all that time mountain biking lest you want increased chances of heart issues.",HaxusPrime,self.Exercise,1557616715

Many people say, including my trainers, that no, we can't; we'd be overworking our muscles and to a detrimental effect. The thing is, ancient humans didn't have such a thing as arm day and leg day, they just had days in which they would at random use more or less any part of the body. However, for some reason I'm more prone to accept we shouldn't weight lift with same body part every day. Or should we? Two questions then.

Exercise,Need exercises to do so I can gain weight without getting chubby,"Background:
I’m an 18 year old guy who, unfortunately, is at one of his most unhealthiest points in my life. After getting on my ADHD meds a while ago I lost so much of my appetite that, three years later, I’m dangerously underweight from starving myself. After finally getting the doctor involved, he says he wants me gaining a pound a week. As someone who was once a pretty chubby kid and who hated every bit of it, I’m really scared to go from being unhealthy to hating my body again.

The point:
I’m looking for exercises for me to incorporate into my normal life so that I can put weight on in the form of lean muscle instead of chub. I’m thinking of starting to go to the gym, but I wouldn’t know what to do there. 

Bottom line: 
I want to get healthier, but I want to stay confident about my body.",toogthemighty,self.Exercise,1557469429

Exercise,I’m so tired of being klutzy...,"So basically growing up I found that I was told A LOT that I did things “weird.” And quite honestly; yea. I’m not graceful, I’m painfully awkward when doing most, if not all, movements. And I feel like I’ve become more and more aware of this since becoming an adult. 

My balance is trash, my understanding of WHERE I am in relation to other things is better some days than others. I’m just pretty tired of being “that klutzy girl” at 24 years old. 

For example; I feel like I never was taught as a child the proper way to run, Ice skate, lift, throw a ball etc because I ALWAYS get told I do it weird and made fun of.  Not to mention running and lifting hurt various aspects of my body. I played an ice sport growing up so obviously I know HOW to do some things enough to play competitive sports but it’s not pretty or graceful.

Exercise,Suggestions for Good Way To Get Started Exercising and Dieting,"My family didn’t believe in exercise or “diet,” just “eat less, weigh less.” So now I’m in college and I’m kinda starting to feel like shit.

So I went to the App Store and downloaded a handful of apps, but I’m a little lost. First of all, I have NO IDEA what I’m doing. I don’t want to just jump in and begin with some of their workouts because I have a feeling I’ll just be strengthening one part of my body or something. And anything that gives me a by-the-week plan costs $100-200 a year. I’m a college student with no income, I can’t be dishing out that kind of cash. And before you ask, my school doesn’t offer any personal trainers.

And the same goes for dieting. I know how to not eat much, but I don’t know how to eat right. I have a calorie counter but anything that says “this much vegetables, this much carbs, etc:” again, money.

I was just wondering if someone could give me a hand. Any alternatives that could give me the info I need. I’m one who can follow instructions or routine, I just need something that would let me know how to make a routine like that. So any app suggestions? I really appreciate it.",JayCraftArt,self.Exercise,1557370962

Exercise,How to find the right exercise for me? Am I just not built for this?,"Hi Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for a bit of advice here. I joined a gym back in Nov 2017 with a one-year contract. I was trying to do it to improve my mood, which has been low for a while now. Between Nov 2017 and Nov 2018 I was pretty good at attending - between 2 and 3 times per week, every week, for about an hour each time. However, I could never really get ""into"" the gym or enjoy it. I tried various things, like watching TV, listening to audiobooks, or using the sauna/pool as a reward for myself, but I never really got into a positive headspace. I saw it more as something I had to do - like, eat, sleep, poop - instead of something I could actually enjoy doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was super proud of myself for going, but I never really achieved anything. I made great progress for the first 6 or so weeks of attending, but then that dropped off. The weights, sets, reps, distances and times I was managing kept broadly the same for the rest of the year. I'd mostly leave the gym feeling sad, angry at myself, and frustrated, like I'd wasted my time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've dabbled in a few more sports, but I live in a small town so there isn't really much to do apart from the gym, 5-a-side or running. I have friends that do all of these, but they're so far out of my league it wouldn't really be practical to train together. I also don't especially want to embarass myself doing 5-a-side, as a lot of my work colleagues do it and are fairly competitive.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering what you guys do to make your exercise more ""fun"" and less of a chore? Is it it's own reward - do you grow to enjoy the exercise - should I just grit my teeth and renew my gym membership? Or is it a matter of sampling as many sports as I can until I find one I enjoy? Are some people just not ""built"" to do exercise and it's a reality I must face that I have to do it the same as I have to brush my teeth twice a day?

Exercise,Trying to develop a diversified workout routine,"Hey all! 

I am trying to develop a diversified workout routine that would work for me on the long run and make my body stronger and healthier. I am a believer that exercise is for health first, and that a good look is just a side effect.

I am currently experimenting with a workout routine that is diversified enough to cover different goals. I exercise mainly three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday), and sometimes I add one more time in the weekend. I have the following routine:

1- Strength Day: This day is for weights. I do the big three (Bench Press, Squats and Deadlift), in addition to a variety of abs exercises. I have a good technique in those exercises so nothing to worry about.

2- Cardio Day: I do Body Combat. A high-intensity cardio class inspired from martial arts. Great for cardio and a little bit for muscles and balance too.

3- Flexibility, mobility, stability and balance day: I am still experimenting with that day. I do some exercises related to shoulder mobility, hips mobility, balance on one foot, different kinds of stretches, etc.

4- Freestyle day: If I do a forth day, I keep it freestyle, some weights here and there, some drills on the punching bag, etc.

I’ve been looking for workout journals/ logs that suit my needs. I’ve been on amazon, Etsy etc to look for one to suit me but aside from one that I think might work I’m struggling to find one.
I need - space that will allow me to track weight training with more than 3/5 sets and more than 7-8 different exercises and then space for cardio and notes. Plus the dates. It would be good if I could find one that has per day over one to two pages.

Exercise,Need an opinion on my workout plan!,"""Active"" days- 3 times a week
• C25K
-Warmup with Run Ready Yoga(NRC), Runner Warm-Up(NCR) and 20 jumping jacks(still brisk walk for the 5 minutes in the program)
-Cooldown with Runner Cooldown(NRC) and Run Ready Yoga(still brisk-to-slow walk in program)
• Strength training/Muscle Exercises
-7M Women App: Hot Legs, Arm Toner, Beginner Abs, Booty Shaper(all of these are easy/beginner and take 10 minutes or less)
-Nike Training Club App: Quick Core Crush 

""Inactive"" Days- 3 times a week
• Flexibility and Endurance Workout/Stretches
-Nike Running Club App: Start-up Benchmark, Runner Flexibility, Drill Essentials, Essential Flow Yoga(Easy, 10 minutes or less)


Everyday
• Jumping Jacks 
-250 a day, spread out across the day. 50 jacks done at a time, so 5 sets of 50 reps finished across the day (100 in the morning, 50 at lunch, 100 at night as an example)
• Walk 8k-10k steps
• Morning time workout stretch
-7M Women App: Morning Stretch(5 minutes)
• Night Stretch
-7M Women App: Night Stretch(8 minutes)


Just a note, all of these exercises done through apps are easy, low intensity, 10 minutes ones. Not super hard or muscle-hurting ones that I'm trying to make myself do. I can do all of these workouts back-to-back relatively easily. The C25K is my harder, more high intensity workout. And on inactive days those ""workouts"" are mainly just stretching and yoga.

Exercise,Why is looking for/building exercises so hard?!,"I'm 14, turning 15 soon, and I've really been looking for exercise routines to do. Whenever I look online for exercise routines/schedules for people my age, I barely get any results, and the ones that show up don't seem to be that helpful, just saying ""as a teenager you should be exercising your _______ area and ______"". The ones that I do find that include a whole fitness plan, how long it will take, how many reps and and how many sets, almost all of them require gym equipment. This has gotten me very frustrated, so I decided I would try and build my own exercise plan, which so far has been one of the most irritating experiences ever. 

I'll find one article that says so do one type of exercises for a certain muscle group, then another article saying not to do what the previous article said to do. It's become complicated, confusing, and very frustrating. The only gym equipment I have access to is an elliptical, which I am trying to use more often, and have tried out a few different exercises, such as the 21 day fix, but I feel like I would prefer having a workout that was made for me, and specifically meant so that I could build muscle. 

At this point, building the actual routine has taken long enough that I most likely could have a emerging 6 pack right now, and that my arms would be a bit stronger. If anyone knows websites or ways of building an exercise schedule, or of I should invest in a personal trainer, please let me know. And for the diet section, after I build the routine and get started on exercising for a bit, I'm going to talk to a nutritionist about meal planning.",kbc_31,self.Exercise,1555978973

My main way of training is to run, but i need help knowing what to do, also how will this affect my upper body as in visual results.

In around a month after than, i am going on a cruise and just desire a good ""summer body"". I dont neet to be ripped, i just would like some form of definition and separation of my chest, arms, and stomach, as they all just look like 1 connected piece of flat skin on my body.

To get this definition i plan on doing around 50-70 push ups and 30 sit ups a day on top of the running (not in one session). Is that too much? 

Also, i have very little body fat so will sit ups show abs relatively quickly? I dont eat much, i just drink a lot of arizona juice. Thats about all of my questions and comments.

Exercise,Fun solo exercise games?,"So I've got a couple of problems:

I need to, and want to, get a little more physically active.

Just running or going to the gym feels boring. I cringe at the thought of it. 

There aren't allot of casual/beginners level sports teams around here i could join. 

So, with access to pretty much no equipment, and only my small appartment and public places to work with, do you have any tips of fun ""single player"" sports, or games, or just ways to challenge myself? Make physical activity into a game I can return to. 

I do skiing when I get the chance, less than once per year. Ice skating, skateboarding, stuff like that would also be fun, but they are a financial investment I can't cover right now. I'm on a really skinny social benefits budget, I basically have enough for food rent and utilities, and nothing else. 

I should mention, I'm coming out of a 5 year depression, and I'm in such bad shape that I've got more or less chronic muscle and joint pain. My doctor gave it to me straight: I need to be more physically active.

Exercise,How can I/we beat DOMS?,"Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.

I'm sure we've all had this time to time and it's painful and I've had it again recently. I don't think there is a sticky thread on it but there should be for beginners like myself. DOMS can discourage and destroy a developing healthy lifestyle, nevermind an exercise routine or life schedule.

Why?
I'm not fit but I want to be. I exercised heavily one time (mistake) by lifting an easy weight of 15kilo but 400 times. Couldn't move. This was in my teens.

So I'm older now at 25 but I don't exercise or develop my muscles primarily in my arms where I'm wanting to build the strength. So... I lifted 5kg in each arm of reps of 13 for 4 times in each arm then only 10 reps 1 time on lifting the reverse muscle. I could not love my arms for days which made my physical job very different.

So, what can I/we do to lower the impact of DOMS or do I/we have to do the older classic ""power through the pain to gain""? ",Sovereign290693,self.Exercise,1553818319

If anyone has advice please tell me.",Rolie87817,self.Exercise,1553805845
Exercise,Pelvic Anteversion,"This is a fairly common problem that can have a multitude of causes.

&amp;#x200B;

Pelvic anteversion can be observed in lateral view and is manifested by a rotation of the pelvis forward. This postural problem can, in the long run, lead to other problems, for example, wear of the joints of the spine at the lumbar level. These joints (zygapophysial joints) limit the extension movement of the spine, so we can deduce that when it is in lumbar hyperlordosis, the zygapophyseal joints are compressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some exercises ([see pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/PxPoR8S)) in which I often observe this dysfunction:

\- The Plank (or even push-ups)

\- The extension of the hip, standing or on pulley

\- The squat 

\- The lying leg curl.

&amp;#x200B;

We can notice a trend among these examples (except the first picture). Exercises aimed at working the gluteus maximus are often accompanied by pelvic anteversion. This may be due to the fact that the gluteus maximus is not often worked in the angle where it is in its most shortened portion. It is therefore weak in the portion where the leg is in maximum extension. If the flexors of the hip lack flexibility, the person will have difficulty to bring his hip in extension. The body absolutely wanting to bring the leg backwards will compensate by recruiting the extensor muscles of the lumbar spine, which will bring the spine in extension (hyperlordosis), the pelvis in anteversion and will bring the leg backwards because of this compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

The possible causes can differ and personal to everyone. They can as much go from the feet to the head.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some reasons that can cause anteversion of the pelvis:

\- Sagging of the plantar arch

\- Femurs in internal rotation

\- Lack of flexibility in the muscles that bring the pelvis into anteversion

\- Lack of mobility of the lumbar vertebrae in flexion

\- Lack of strength of the extensor muscles of the hip (especially the gluteus maximus, also hamstrings)

\- Hyperactive lumbar spine extensor muscles

\- Lack of strength in the abdominal muscles

\- Thoracic hypercyphosis - Cervical hyperlordosis ...

&amp;#x200B;

In short, in these possible causes, these can be as much a cause as a consequence of the anteversion of the pelvis. It must also be known that these ""causes"" may have other causes. It depends on each individual and the level of difficulty in resolving this problem will vary with each individual.

&amp;#x200B;

To abbreviate this post, I am limited to these causes only and also know that for each cause, corrective exercises must be done. If you want to know more about these corrective exercises, contact us, since it's something that has to be taken care of individually (contrary to what YouTube videos can do to you) how to correct the anteversion of the pelvis 5 minutes'').

Exercise,Exercise with an Ankle Fusion,"A couple of months ago, I had to get an ankle fusion performed. Prior to that, I would usually do yoga and walking to get my daily exercise. I'm finally up and walking again and would like to start up an exercise regiment again, but I'm not really sure where to start. A lot of the poses in yoga I am no longer able to do. The only advice my doctor had was to avoid things that would put a lot of stress on the joint. Things like running, jogging, jumping, squats, and many yoga poses that require balancing on one leg or flexibility in the ankle. I've been doing small amounts of walking outside of work but I still need to take it easy.  I'm at the 6 month mark in my recovery and it has been healing very well, but my doctor says it won't be fully healed until I hit the one year mark.

Has anyone had their ankle fused or know anyone that has? What exercises would be good to stay in shape/limber without having to put stress on the joint?

Exercise,Lower trapezius," A forgotten and neglected muscle, but SO IMPORTANT.

&amp;#x200B;

**Its fuctions:** 

\- Retracts the shoulder blades (""sticking"" them together)

\- Lowers the shoulder blades

\- Upper rotation of the scapula (hard to describe but for the left scapula = clockwise rotation, right scapula = counter clockwise rotation)

&amp;#x200B;

This muscle plays a key role in the stability of the scapula when raising our arms high (ex: when you want to reach an object that's higher than you or during a shoulder press).

&amp;#x200B;

Many people at the gym train the upper trapezius with shrugs but neglect the lower trapezius. This may result in excessive shoulder blade compensation when working with the arms up in the air. This is a compensation that's often seen in those with tendinitis of the rotatory cuff in the shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see a good example of exercise to work on the lower trapezius on the image below. This exercise was tested in a study among 10 exercises as being the one that best recruits the lower trapezius (1). 

&amp;#x200B;

Execution: Lay on your stomach, try to raise your arm next to your head, keeping your shoulder blades as down as possible. The angle of the arm should be aligned with the orientation of the muscle fibers of the lower trapezius, which is easily seen in the image. There are many ways to make this exercise easier or harder.

&amp;#x200B;

Exercise,Question about strange racing heart rate immediately after intense workout,"I do a lot of HIIT at Orange Theory, but lately I have been pushing myself harder and harder. I've noticed after I get done with an all-out portion of the exercise where I've pushed myself really hard, within 10-15 seconds my heart will start racing to the point that I'm standing there doing nothing but my heart will be close to 200 bpm. It's an odd sensation, but I'm certainly not light headed or weak while this happens. Within 15-30 seconds, it calms VERY rapidly and I'm back to normal. I can corroborate this with what I see on the heart rate screen in the studio, as I'm at ~110% of max. After it calms down I can resume normal workout.

While I'm certainly not asking for medical advice, I'm wondering if anyone knows of this condition and/or if it's serious? It almost reminds me of a computer that gets too hot and the fan will turn up to full blast trying to cool down the processor as quickly as possible. Thanks!",packetthriller,self.Exercise,1553378928

Exercise,What is the Importance of Exercise?," Exercise is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle and can also benefit mental and emotional well-being. This is because the chemicals and hormones that are released through it combat stress and promote happiness. Even just doing as little as half an hour everyday can help, even if all you are doing is brisk walking.  


One of the main reasons that people opt to do a form of [exercise](https://www.bodybuildingdiet101.com/search/label/Exercise%20Tips) is in order to [lose weight](https://www.bodybuildingdiet101.com/2016/05/how-does-one-lose-weight-in-natural-way.html) and exercise is one of the most effective ways to do this. If you’re BMI ([Body Mass](https://www.bodybuildingdiet101.com/2018/02/best-way-to-build-muscle-some-tips-to.html) Index) is between 25 and 29 you are classed as overweight. If your BMI is above 30 then you are clinically classed as being obese. Your BMI calculates whether you are a healthy weight for your height. Ideally your BMI should be between 18.5 and 24.9. By taking regular exercise you will be able to maintain your BMI, keeping it at an ideal figure.

I understand there are different ""days"". Like leg day, back day, arms, abs.... what are all the days? How often do you rotate through them? Do you ever combine days (like for example do back and arms on the same day?) What exercises/machines do you do for each day?

Exercise,Lacking in Willpower? Small goals work better than strict big ones (well for me anyways!)," 

I set myself a target of living a healthier lifestyle this year. I know that's very vague but in the past I've set myself strict goals, missed one week and then given up. So I said to myself I would start slow and make small goals that I know I can meet in order to meet the bigger target of living healthier. 

In January I joined the gym, which is great, but the action of actually going is something else. So I set myself the target of going once a week at least in January until March, if I want to go more, I will. I also started with a PT in January. Something I said I'd never do because it's soooo expensive. But you know what, with that in mind, it's totally worth the money, and she really pushes me! She also helped with my confidence in the gym, I honestly had no idea how to 'gym.' I've also started playing netball twice a week - I absolutely love it! It's like a ninja exercise !

My next step is my food... food is literally the hardest for me! I have no will power not to binge eat my weight in crappy foods. But from the beginning of March I started to meal prep my breakfast and lunches on a Sunday. This has really helped me to stick to specific meals. Not only that, but I'm saving an average of £30 on eating out. Can't go wrong! 

It's really easy to set goals, but it's just as easy to stop working towards them, or missing the point of them, or even not seeing any results. But I had a PT Session on Sunday (work out below), and I can tell you, that workout below I couldn't have even contemplated doing part of that when I started in January. That to me is a result. I haven't always gone to gym once a week (I was ill for 3 weeks in February which hindered me!), but I have improved my cardio so much, I'm impressed with myself. It's starting to become part of my lifestyle. I'm so pleased that I started slowly this year, it has really made a difference to my mental well-being. Instead of constantly being disappointed in myself for not meeting strict goals, I'm happy to meet small goals knowing it will all work towards to the bigger one. *This*... is what makes it a healthier lifestyle.

Exercise,Do I need a scheduled rest day,"Hi all,

Very interested to hear people's opinions on this. I quite dislike taking rest days as I love exercise and it boosts my mood and sets me up well for sitting down all day at my office job.

I would like to know peoples opinions on if I need to take a day off a week or not to avoid overreaching.

I basically never get sick (maybe once every 3 years on average, if that and only for a day or 2) and have run marathons and competed at sports at quite a high level.

currently I'm training for great wall of china marathon and some triathlons. I don't train or compete anymore to break records or kill myself. I do it purely for the enjoyment and to motivate others.

my current schedule is something like this (I never push myself more than about 75-80% unless racing which i'll do 3 times a year type thing)

Monday - 2km swim continuous at 50-60% effort
Tuesday - 2km swim 1km continuous at 50-60% +10 x 100m at 75-80% effort
Wednesday - 12km run (60-70% effort)
Thursday - 45 mins Weights (60-70%effort)
Friday - 2km swim continuous at 50-60% effort
Sat - 15-18km run at 50-60%
Sunday - 2km swim at 50-60% + 30mins weights/core

Aside from that I do about 10,000steps a day just in general life and then I'm sedentary at my office job and much of my life.

I was taking 1 day off where I'd do some core and an easy walk on the treadmill for about 45mins just watching Netflix but found that I would 100% rather do an easy 2km swim than the walk. is that okay or is that too much? i listen to my body and take a day off when i feel i need it but this is only once every 2-3 weeks. so my questions is, can i take a rest day every 2-3 weeks or should i be taking a scheduled one each week?

i suppose i just fear overreaching based on things I've read. but every day i wake up keen to exercise, can i? and on the rare day i want a day off, can that be my only rest day

any comments are beneficial",Rupertluxton,self.Exercise,1552280001

Exercise,Push-ups Tips,"I go to a gym that has instructor-led group classes and one of the go-to exercises is the standard push-up.

However, I can't do a proper push-up to save my life and there is definitely a disconnect when the instructor tries to help.

I've only been going for a month, I have weak upper body strength, and I know this will not happen overnight.

No matter the start position, my push-ups are pathetic 
(1) start in the plank position, I lower down an inch and back up, barely moving and struggling to keep the plank. (2) start with the body on the ground, arms and hands at the ready, I end up doing a ""peeling"" motion starting at my neck to my hips, unable to lift the lower half of my body.

The instructor sees that the push-up isn't easy for me but he tells me to ""keep my core tight"" and that it's a natural up and down motion.  I don't want to talk myself down but I really think it's a weak upper body strength issue and it will be a while before I can do proper push-ups.

I love this gym and will continue going but I would love some tips on how to improve my push-ups.  Whether it's modified versions, exercises that include the muscles needed to be strengthened for push-ups, or a mind over matter thing.  

For upper body strength reference: flies, kickbacks, curls, and presses are 5-8lb dumbbells and 10-15lb kettlebells.  ",awkwardly_competent,self.Exercise,1551241543

Exercise,How do I get back to being moderately active??,"Hello, I have always struggled with weight loss at a young age. When I was about 13 I was on the verge of becoming a type 2 diabetic due to my family primarily eating crappy foods. My mother would put me on various diets and techniques throughout the years to lose weight which never worked because you can’t live off of diets... I was fairly active when I was a kid. I was in softball, volleyball, and other activities. This made me incredibly strong and pretty fit but I never seemed to lose to weight. Once I got to my senior year of high school I began to get lazy. I rarely exercised or even went outside and it began to affect my mental state and confidence. Currently I do not have the motivation to work out (especially with this winter weather and getting over sickness) and when I do work out I get incredibly sore which lasts for a few days. I am eating a much better diet but am wanting to really get back into being active like when I was younger. I weigh 231 lbs and am only 18.

Do you guys have any thoughts or ideas on how to stay active or motivated? Or how to slowly work my way into becoming more active? What steps did you take to make a better lifestyle and where are you now?

I have only managed to improve in very small increments for how long and how intense I can run/cycle/stair/row for. Also, I noticed that I bruise VERY easily, and the marks are almost always in a line down my shin, or in weird spots on my arms or back of legs where I don’t recall ever hitting it. This has started happening more as my exercise routine has become more vigorous (I see a trainer so I’m not making up my own moves or training with inappropriately heavy weights). Finally, I’ve been having BIG yawning issues, but ONLY while I’m working out. That part I find the weirdest. I’ve never seen anyone yawning at the gym, but when I’m exercising it’s literally about once a minute. Embarrassing actually.

I have been diagnosed with Eustachian tube dysfunction, so all things combined I’m concerned there may be some kind of bloodflow disorder at play.

Exercise,5 Common Mistakes that we make in Exercising,"Exercise can reduce the chances of depression, cancer, heart disease and it can increase your energy levels that will help you to think clearer, and even it can slow down the aging process. However, there are some pitfalls listed below that can negatively affect your workout progress. 

  

# Mistake One: Skipping Warm-Up

It is noted by a certified exercise physiologist John Paul Catanzaro that it takes about 10 to 15 seconds of muscular contraction to raise the body temperature by 1 degree Celsius and an effective warm-up must raise your body temperature by 1 to 2 degree Celsius. So, not warming up can raise the chances of injury while you are doing high-intensity exercise especially sprinting. Squat, Arm Circles, Shoulder Shrugs, Trunk Twist, Side bends are some of the warm-up exercises that is all you really need before getting started with high-intensity exercises. One such case is of Rita who is an online assignment help provider, “I slept little and begin heavy exercising in whatever time I got without warming up and eventually pulled my back muscles due to which I had to suffer for almost six months.”

Exercise,3 Exercises That Burn More Calories - Bodybuilding Diet 101," 

## [Calorie Burning Exercises](https://www.bodybuildingdiet101.com/2018/01/3-exercises-that-burn-more-calories.html)

Being fat is not common nowadays, as a large percentage of people are dealing with the problem of being overweight. Being an '**extra-large**' person in a normal-sized world can also affect the way of life. Fat people have to deal with searching for clothes that fit and fitting in spaces that are not designed to accommodate their girth.

Exercise,Any diet/workout tips for a newbie?,I am 23 and 5'3 152lb guy. I work a part time job at retail. I used to workout at Planet Fitness  but i wasn't consistent so i cancelled my membership. And i actually just ate whatever i felt was healthy and i also didn't eat well either. Pretty much i didn't even paid attention to what i was eating even now. I eat pretty bad lots of chips and soda. I always sitting or laying around at home other than work. I want to change my body i always been skinny with a fat stomach since i was a child and i just never put in the effort to change that. I see all these fitness influencers on Instagram and they are very motivating but my living situation is a little rough atm. And i always think to myself that i want a body like that. I just got my permit on September and i am still learning how to drive now. I can take a bus or a Uber. I just don't know which would be a better choice. I do like Uber and Lyft because they are quick instead of waiting for the dang bus. I just don't know what i should do i've been thinking about going to the gym again for awhile. I would workout at home but the gym is more motivating. ,Zeero007,self.Exercise,1550402434
Exercise,I want to start but don't know how,"Hi, I'm 17 years old who doesn't have access to a gym but I have a set of free weights but don't have a routine or types of exercises. Plz help me.",rmpayton,self.Exercise,1550367714
Exercise,"I haven’t had an appetite in several years, so I’m worried about starting an exercise routine, since I usually have an empty stomach.","7 years ago, I started experiencing depression, and ever since, I haven’t had an appetite. Eating and preparing food always feels like a chore, and a lot of times I feel like I’m  force feeding myself. It doesn’t help that I’ve always struggled financially, so that’s another reason why I look at eating in a negative light. It also doesn’t help that I love the taste of coffee, use it often as an emotional pick me up, and crave the taste and caffeine daily. I know Coffee kills my appetite. If I don’t drink it in the morning, I’ll crave it and drink it in the evening. It also doesn’t help that all I ever have an appetite for is nuts, fruit, pasta, or bread. The nuts are expensive and I eat them too quickly, fruit I also eat too quickly or it’ll go bad (I’m just gonna start making smoothies with frozen fruit) and I don’t think you’re supposed to just live off of bread and pasta. I also don’t get hungry until around 2pm, usually. 

I know changing my appetite is gonna take a while. I used to eat a lot of quick, easy meals. But I’m hyper focused on my health now. I get annoyed if I eat something unhealthy just because it’s quick and easy. 

And I want to start exercising because I’m tired of playing Skyrim or watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and wishing that I could feel powerful and strong like Buffy or my Skyrim character. I want to be stronger and healthier! 

But I’m overthinking and freaking myself out about how to do that when I have such bad eating habits. I want to go to the gym now, but all I’ve eaten today is a pack of cashews around 1pm, some ramen noodles around 3:30pm, and I just got an iced mocha at a local coffee shop because I’m PMSing really bad and want an emotional pick me up. 

I figure I can’t go to the gym right now because I’m not fueled well enough. I haven’t gone grocery shopping, so the only thing I could eat right now is make some hard boiled eggs. I am having home made burgers tonight, so maybe I’ll just go to the gym after I eat that. It’ll probably be around 10pm. 

Idk, am I over thinking things? For context, I’m a 25 yr old woman, and I am bordering on being underweight for my height. I’ve always been really small, though. Ever since childhood. But I’m sure my appetite plays a part in my current weight. 

TLDR: I’m worried about going to the gym when I haven’t eaten much all day, and worried about that becoming a bad habit. ",gonetotheforest,self.Exercise,1550359956

Exercise,Newbie to working out. Any advice?,"I (f23) just started two weeks ago with almost daily workouts (two rest days a week). I'm only 5ft tall but I weight 190lbs, which is nowhere near an ideal weight for my height I know. I am not only trying to slim my waist but also tone my muscles, and my trainer is really good about directing me with exercises he thinks will help and pushing me to do more than I think I can do.

That said I'm still a bit discouraged. I used to lose weight so easily with just a diet. I've not lost a single pound with combined diet and exercise thus far. Working out is also very hard for me. My muscles are super weak and I don't know how to run or breathe properly. And the pain is getting to me too. Knots in my legs when I run. The aches after the workout.

I'm stretching. Warming up. Cooling down. And drinking lots of water. I just want to know if there's anything else I can be doing to improve results and decrease all the pain.

Ok, I am on disability for mental illness and it does concern me that I am getting to lazy and not doing anything for my body.

I broke my leg mopping the floor in June (never mop bear foot) They made me do exercises and i still got the exercise sheets. 

I always hear how good yoga is but,. i am afraid to do all the twists and turns in it I see on youtube videos.

The exercises i was doing in the hospital was like leg lifts and dumbells that i have...i probally need to get back into that.

I wish i really knew what all to do for my body..there is so much out there....I thought about some pushups, leg lifts, running in place, dumbells and sit ups....i can do those and Don't fear breaking my leg.

The doctor that worked on my leg  said i am fine and even told me i don't have to see him any more. 

I got a knew regular doctor cause my doctor i had just happened to retire the week i broke my leg....She is on maternity leave i think...i wonder if i can call and ask any her any way what i can and can't do.

I don't know how all this works....before i broke my leg i never even been to a doctor....What a wake up call it was...

So, any one got any advice here? ",willybilly30,self.Exercise,1548583287

Exercise,"I'm having pain and weakness in my left knee with a ""snapping"" sound just above the kneecap. Help!","Background: After being hit by a car and breaking my femur in 2017, I had emergency surgery, where they cut through my patellar tendon, hollowed out the femur, and put a titanium rod up through the knee to my hip, where it was secured with screws. I went through PT for several months, and was then discharged to the fitness complex at my hospital to continue recovery.

My problem is I'm experiencing general weakness and pain (like a stiff soreness) in the left knee when bending with weight (i.e. walking DOWN stairs, squatting, lunges, etc), paired with a ""snapping"" sound with pain any time I bring my left leg from straight to bent withOUT weight (i.e. [hamstring curls](http://bodybybodde.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/standing-hamstring-curls.png)). The ""snapping"" is felt just above my left kneecap, and it feels like it's on top of the knee, not inside or behind it (I believe this is my quadricepts tendon). I also have trouble doing ab exercises that involve moving the legs; most notably, if I lay on my back to do [pilates toe taps](https://acewebcontent.azureedge.net/expert-articles/2017/05/2017-05-11-pilates-ball-core-strengthening-workout-toe-taps.png), gravity pulling on the leg makes the knee hurt. There is pain ONLY with movement. The area is not tender or swollen. 

I'm not sure why this started happening. It just started one day without me doing anything different. I've been back to the PT office to ask for help, and they've shown me how to tape it and what kind of brace to wear, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better. I've tried icing, stretching, and rest, but nothing seems to work.

Does anyone know what specifically causes this, and what can I do/avoid to help it heal? Is it OK to keep exercising it, or will the ""snapping"" cause damage? I will be seeing my doctor soon and plan to ask.

Walked square into a door frame barefoot at the end of the AFC championship game this past weekend and very clearly (because I've done it before...on the same door frame) broke my pinky toe. For the past 4 months, I've ran on the treadmill/gone for walks which amount to around 3-10 miles a day. It's kind of become ""my happy place"" and a means to keep on track in life, because 4 months ago, I was into some very poor choices. Basically running/walking has kept me on the right path. 

Has anyone had a similar disruption? Did you just focus on upper body strength training? Think a recumbent/exercise bike would be okay to use as long as I place my feet on the pedals in a way which doesn't put pressure on the area?

Exercise,How much damage have I caused?,"I’m a college upperclassmen who luckily has grandparents who mostly have lived quite long and who was raised by parents who made sure I was eating healthy. I’ve been slightly overweight my entire life, but I didn’t drink or do any drugs and was relatively healthy.

Fast forward to the past 1.5 years. It has been really hard, and I unfortunately turned to drugs for the solution. I became severely addicted to marijuana (seriously, it happens to some people) and smoked a crazy amount every day for 1.5 years. I basically stopped going to the gym during this time, ate solely fast food due to munchies, and gained 25 pounds. I also have been juuling for the past 9 months; at my worst, I was going through a juul pod every 2 days. One positive of my smoking habit, though, is that I really don’t drink that much compared to a regular college student.

I’ve woken up and been drug free since the new year. Lost almost 10 pounds in a healthy manner and threw all my drugs away. Now that I’m sober, I know I’m not going back. I just hope that my 21 year old body is resilient enough to rebound. How much future damage have I caused?

Exercise,What are the top ways to make exercise fun?,"Exercise is one of the pillars of longevity. The benefits of exercise are many: heart health, weight management, better sleep, improved mood, more energy and many more. The biggest benefit? Reducing your risk of chronic illnesses. Through exercise, you’ll stay healthy longer, age well and feel great.

Add a Friend

Find someone to be your exercise buddy. Don’t choose just anyone: Pick someone who is full of energy, fun and who you look forward to spending time with. That way, you’ll want to exercise just to be with your friend.

Group Fitness

Group classes are a way to meet new people, have an instructor to keep your form and effort good and be motivated to go each time. Shop around for your class: Find an instructor who has both knowledge and enthusiasm. You can gauge the social tone an instructor creates by watching if anyone talks to him or her before or after the class and if the other participants talks to each other.


Play Something

We use the word “play” in front of sports because they are fun. You “play” tennis, golf, soccer, softball or any other sport. Find a sport that you used to “play” when younger and take it up again. Choose a team sport when possible to add some socialization.


Audio Books and Podcasts

Get yourself a tiny music player and download some audio books or podcasts. Hundreds of free podcasts are available covering any topic you can imagine. Audio books can also be easily downloaded. This way, when you think about exercising, you can be looking forward to “reading” the next chapter in your novel.

Listen to music or podcasts

There are few experiences in life more pleasurable than turning up the music and drowning out the world around you. With so many podcasts and music apps available on your smartphone, you can easily find entertainment options perfectly suited to your personal tastes. Never worry what people may think of you when working out;instead, crank up the volume and get lost in your own world. You’ll be in shape before you know it.

Mix It Up

Don’t do the exact same exercise routine every day; mix it up. If you always run on the treadmill, run outside on a nice day. Take a week off your lifting routine and do a Pilates class instead. As soon as you feel your exercise routine becoming a rut, find something else to do.

Relax

The best part about exercising is how much you enjoy the downtime. If you think laying on your couch all day is enjoyable, it has nothing on that hour you spend as a couch potato after a rigorous workout. Jay-Z said it best, “in order to experience joy, you need pain.” The harder you push yourself while exercising, the better you’ll feel when you’re relaxing.

Exercise,Are those specific diets and routines really necessary to have a mid-muscly body?,"Excuse my words. My knowledge on this subject is almost zero.

While talking about everything, I mentioned a friend of mine who recently became a Personal Trainer that I was working out. I briefly mentioned how I workout and my weekly routine. He then began talking about how my diet should be, and he gave me this long list of things I should add.  
He mentioned that there should be 5 meals every day, mixed in this intricate way so the body always has energy when needed.   
He said my first meal should be high on (what gives you energy). Eggs with bacon and shakes or natural juices first thing in the morning. For lunch, he said pasta was bad, and that I must leave that as a ""special"" treat for the weekends. He mentioned pure meat cuts (no grease, no cartilage) should go in the middle of the day. He told me I should eat more fish, reorder the time of meals, and basically reorganize my whole life.

I'm pretty sure there will be people in this sub that know a lot about these things. Trust me when I say I don't want to criticize or underestimate or offend any of you or the efforts you did to either study or workout to reach your desired objective, but I find it hard to believe these diets and activities are a must in order to work out.  
I know ithey might be slightly flexible, and that they vary from person to person and the desired objectives. I also know that my friend's recommendations are for the average person, but still...  
Was it like this 50, or even 100 years ago? Surely these things weren't needed, and one could still have a good body.  
Also, I have this small conspiracy theory. I believe these things taught to Personal Trainers make the person consume more, pay more, and basically spend in things that are not really needed, but since we crave for an idea of a ""perfect body"", we are willing to buy every food, drug, or contraption we see in magazines or TV.

I also find it slightly difficult to reach, at least from my point of view.  
My country's economic is in the shitter, and keeping up with a diet like this requires a very well paid job.

Exercise,"(New to exercise) Help with ""ghost abs""","(Sorry for the cheesy title, I didn't know what else to call the situation..) If someone could confirm/explain what's happening, that'd be great :)

I recently started exercising after an era of nothing. I specifically downloaded a popular-looking app, ""Six pack in 30 days"". I'm on the second level (so just under six-pack level) and over halfway through, but something slightly weird is happening. I have been getting a burn for the first half of a workout, then the second half becomes exponentially easier. I'm imagining that natural painkillers are kicking in. However, for the past couple of days, I not only can't feel my abs in the second half of the workout, but I can't do even a single situp. However, if I keep my back on the floor I can still do reverse crunches no problem (and don't feel anything). All I found on google was information about ""not feeling abs"" in relation to not getting a workout, but the inability to do a situp plus the burn at the start indicates to me that this is not the case. So, I have some questions...

Am I going at it too hard, too fast (also considering the app ramps up gradually)? Are my assumptions correct or is something different probably happening? If my assumptions are right, why can I still do reverse crunches so easily?

Any answers would be greatly appreciated :)",AetherCrux,self.Exercise,1547369257

Exercise,Exercise routine with a healing shoulder,"Hi there. Unfortunately the day after Christmas I fell down a big set of hardwood stairs and dislocated my shoulder. I spent 4 hours in the ER with it out of socket but there was no tearing and no fractures. I took it really easy in a sling for a week, saw an ortho, was told to keep it immobilized for another 3 weeks and I will start Physical Therapy in February. This is the first injury of its kind and the doctor anticipates a full recovery with little to no chance of re-occurrence therefor is not suggesting surgery.

I need to exercise. I am on a Ketogenic diet now for over a year and exercise has been a huge part of my routine, heavy lifting, cardio, hiit, yoga, dance- and I was supposed to start BJJ the first of the year but ... yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here suggest any core (?) or lower body exercise I can do that will not jeopardize my healing? I know it's only a couple weeks but believe me when I say that I NEED this. It has nothing to do with losing weight or keeping muscle at this point, it's for mental clarity and de-stress. I would love to be able to make gains during this time but I understand if that's impossible. I am in little to no pain but am still keeping my arm pretty close to my body.

Aside from walking, what other things can I do that don't involve my arms? Are there any routines anyone specifically knows about for staying active while healing from a shoulder dislocation?

&amp;#x200B;

I much appreciate it!

Exercise,Are vegans less able to do physical labour than meat eaters?,"Hi internet.  


Just to start I am not trolling or trying to bait vegans I just have a question.  


I have a friend who posits that if people were all vegan we never would have moved out of the stone age due to his claim that vegans are less able to do physical work than meat eaters so thus we wouldn't have been able to transition to an agricultural society.   


The evidence he is basing his claim on is on a study which found that vegans have a lower BMI (Body Mass Index) than meat eaters by about 10 to 20%. He thus claims that this is evidence that vegans are less able to do physical labour than meat eaters.  


I am not an exercise physiologist but I disagree because I find it strange to believe that there are no vegan labourers or people who do physical work. Also because I don't believe straight BMI is an indication of functional strength but that is beside the point.  


I am interested to know what does science have to say about the claim that vegans are less able to do physical labour than meat eater for instance.

I will do my own research but any papers or qualified opinions on this will be most helpful.  ",GeorgeS2017,self.Exercise,1546340864

Exercise,Getting started,"I've wanted to start exercising for a while now, but I keep making excuses to not do it just yet. The most common of these is that I don't have a plan or diet. I've tried finding some online, but have discovered that the most helpful information tends to come from people rather than articles, and as such I have turned to the ""bundle of good advice"" known as the internet.

Some background information about myself in case you would like to help. I'm an underweight 16 year old (soon 17) male with little to no experience exercising, no equipment but a few adjustable dumbbells and no money for a gym membership. I've always found it difficult to put on weight (hence being underweight) regardless of how much I eat, so I suspect I have a high metabolism. I'm also a vegetarian and as such won't follow diets that require meat, but I do eat dairy products. Btw, there are vegetarian protein options available where I live so it's not too much of a problem.

My goal for exercise isn't just to build practical muscle, but also visible muscles. Not insane levels like film stars, but well defined and sustainable with a bit of effort once I've gone through the brunt of the work (sustaining is easier than building right?). I'm also kind of self conscious about my height (5"" 8) and though it's not necessary any information that helps increase growth would be much appreciated.

Background info.

I am female, nearly 38. Approx weight 105kg/233lbs/16st 7lbs. Height 5' 6""/1.67m

Been dabbling in keto and intermittent fasting and looking to commit to IF  and lower carbs (though probably not full on keto). 

I travel overseas for work around 12 weeks a year. I HATE the gym (have a physical reaction similar to a mild panic attack to going in now). I need to lose weight but am not motivated by weight loss. 

I am however slightly more motivated at being healthier and reducing my chances of dementia, at having better sex and reducing foot and ankle pain (i badly sprained my ankle a few years ago walking a marathon and stupidly walked on the sprained ankle for the last 6 miles making it worse and then sprained repeatedly after that l.) 

I danced a lot as a youngster and totally loved it but am struggling to find dance classes for adults in my area. So I figure I need to accept my dislike for the gym and look for other activities that I can do when not travelling for work. 

Any ideas for me to look into would be appreciated...

Exercise,Wanna get back on but i don't know how,I am 5'9 female 19yo. I currently weigh about 190 but at the beginning of the summer I weighed 160 and have been steadily putting on weight.

I also used to weigh about 220 because of that issue but for the last month or so I've finally got it under control and would like to start exercising again. Currently between jobs and no car because I moved/had a Junker so I can't go to the gym yet. I looked up everything I can do diet wise to help my body before/during/after a workout. It's winter so it's too cold to run outside anymore and cardio was my main thing before I stopped exercising around this time last year again because it got too cold for me to run outside so I fell off the wagon. Is there any way for me to have cardio movement inside without a gym and special equipment? ,Woweemcgee99,self.Exercise,1545506944

Exercise,"Is it easier to get your muscles back if you’ve previously had decent muscle tone in the past, compared to getting lean muscle from fat in the first place?","Not sure if my title made any sense lol, so I’ll explain a little more here. I’m (23F) going to Hawaii in 9 days and am deff not in the best shape of my life right now. But at the same time, I’m definitely not in the worst shape of my life either. I’m 5’2 and fluctuate around 133 lbs for reference. So what I’m wondering is, if I used to have decent muscle tone (mainly in my abs/ legs, and lost it around May of this year when i stopped working out) is it possible to get some of that tone back if I do lots of ab/leg/butt workouts before my trip? Obviously I know not to expect any major results in just 9 days lol, but I’m curious it it’s easier to get muscle tone if you have had muscles in the past compared to if I were just starting out. My bf always says that he can go to the gym just for a week straight and look noticeably different. I plan on working out regardless because I want to get back in the habit in general, but I’m just wondering what to expect! ",izzyfbabyyy,self.Exercise,1545368374

I thought, what if I just make it a daily routine? I can't tell myself this is one of my off days and it turns into something like brushing my teeth or showering.  Sure, I could skip these things, but the world thanks me for doing them and I feel better after having done them, much like exercise. 

I have been using my elliptical daily for the last 10 days for 30 minutes and Bowflex (arms only) 3 days a week.  I am starting to see some results already which is motivating for me.  I am feeling a little sore though, is it advisable to take some rest days?  If so, how much?  I would ideally like to continue daily if it is possible to so that I don't lose momentum. 

My previous 3 days a week wasn't yielding the same results I am seeing anywhere near this fast and I'm finding it easier to stick to by doing it every day.  

I am 38, 165lbs and I'm okay with a little soreness if it simply takes a couple more weeks of doing this to get used to it so long as I'm not doing any harm to myself.

Exercise,Exercise and food advice from Scott Adams,"    I believe exercise makes people smarter, psychologically braver, more creative, more energetic, and more influential. In an online article about twenty habits of successful people, the second item on the list is exercise five to seven days a week. Other studies back this notion–physical fitness and daily exercise are correlated with success in business and in life.

— Page 148

Scott Adams is a big believer in fitness. As a kid, he used to play three to five different sports a day. However, as Adams became an adult, more and more responsibilities piled up and he went from exercising every day to exercising once a week.

After several years, Adams eventually managed to make exercise a habit and now he does it every day. Here’s how he did it.

To start, Adams recommends being active every day.

How does he find the motivation to do so?

Simple, his rule is to “never exercise so much in one day that you won’t feel like being active the next day. To put that another way, the right amount of exercise today is whatever amount makes me look forward to being active tomorrow” (pg 210).

Adams writes that if you exercise and are sore the next day, you’re overdoing it. Soreness is a penalty for exercise, and if everything you workout you get punished, you’ll find something else to do in no time.

Instead of doing heavy workouts, you should do light exercise says, Adams. Light exercise reduces your stress and boosts your energy. “Over time, as you become fitter, you will naturally increase your exercise level, but by then your body will be equipped to handle it.”

Adams recommends rewarding yourself after your workout with something pleasurable, such as a tasty but also healthy snack, or a nice cup of coffee \[personally, I drink for a tasty protein shake but you get the idea\].

And if you don’t feel like exercising, he’s a great tip Adam uses.

Even if you feel like staying home on the couch and eating ice cream, at least put on your workout shoes and clothes. Then take a trip down to the gym. Adams says that 95% of the time, just entering the gym will boost his energy and motivate him to work out since he’s already there. But sometimes, he gets to the gym, looks around and leaves.

However, this doesn’t mean he failed.

At least he got out of his house and got to the gym which is more than most people do. Also, the vast majority of the time when he gets to the gym he’ll work out. No one is perfect, but if out of 365 days you workout 95% of those days that’s darn close to perfect.

And when it comes to the length of a workout or the type of exercise,  Adams says to not worry about that.

All that matters is making exercise into a daily habit. “Studies indicate that moderate levels of exercise are actually the best for longevity. Over time you’ll naturally gravitate toward adding the variety and challenge that your body can handle” (pg 212).

Bonus: How To Eat Healthy

    Pay attention to your energy level after eating certain foods. Find your pattern.
    
    Remove unhealthy, energy-draining food from your home. 
    
    Stock up on convenient healthy foods (e.g., apples, nuts, bananas) and let laziness be your copilot in eating right.
    
    Stop eating foods that create feelings of addiction: white rice, white potatoes, desserts, white bread and fried foods.
    
    Eat as much healthy food as you want, whenever you want.
    
    Get enough sleep, because tiredness creates the illusion of hungry.
    
    If your hunger is caused by tiredness, try healthy foods with fat, such as nuts, avocados, protein bars, and cheese, to suppress the hungry feeling.
    
    If you’re eating for social reasons only, choose the healthiest options with low calories.
    
    Learn how to season your healthy-yet bland foods. 

Also, if you don’t know if you’re actually hungry or just bored, follow Scott’s Apple rule: If you’re not hungry enough to eat an apple, you are not hungry.",alexwiec,self.Exercise,1542042088

Exercise,Lower Ab Workouts,"Howdy,

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I thought I’d try. So long story short I had a surgery on my stomach about 5 years ago, which left a vertical scar from right above my belly button up to almost my chest. Before this surgery I had the beginnings of a 6 pack, with not a lot of fat from my belly button down. Since that surgery however I cannot lose the fat below the start of the scar. I can post a picture if it would help better explain the situation, but it is very frustrating. My abs are pretty strong and defined from my belly button up but for the life of me I can’t lose this weight. My folks say it’s like a pouch after a woman has a c-section, and I didn’t do the proper exercises after the surgery to strengthen those muscles so I’m shit out of luck. I’m a 6 foot 200 pound guy with a pretty athletic build other than this pouch. I’ve tried all of the lower ab exercises I can find on google and I’ve tried altering my diet and nothing works. I’m pretty healthy otherwise but if anyone has any tips to get rid of this it would be greatly appreciated.",djcoldcuts69,self.Exercise,1540179340

Exercise,"How is exercise healthy for you when your body is screaming not to do it, ie if you feel like crap and are depressed and exhausted and can barely move - isn't then massive amounts of sedentary stillness and rest healthier and better - listening to your body?","
I almost never feel like exercising or doing all this crazy sh!t, I'm usually very tired and stressed out. I eat super healthy. I don't see how adding a bunch of pounds of weights on my back is going to help improve my health when I am barely struggling to get through basic day-to-day tasks, make sense? I lay around a lot because I am so tired and feel like crap and dull. But people tell me"" You've gotta exercise"" DUDE, for me to get up right now and go run 10 miles or even 1 or start doing squats, it just seems ridiculous and harmful and even more damaging and stressful. 

Honestly it feels like it's adding more stress, killing me, and causing hair loss. Serious. I've actually seen my hair get thinner and recede more after intense weight sessions, changing nothing else in my routine and diet. Like it's just adding too much stress, so, I wanna be buff and strong and lean, but, the training seems to be killing me faster, so, wtf, uhh.... 

Is seems like sitting in meditation or something or laying down in bed for 4 hours would be a better option at this point for healing and gaining strength? Oh and I noticed after exercising I would feel even more depressed and anxious irritable and tired after, and of course sore. It just seems like it is adding all this stress on my plate for my body, which is bad. Can anyone give any feedback here?!! 

TLDR: I feel like shit and overwhelmed by life. How is adding 300 lbs on my back going to make my life easier and me feel better when my body is screaming at me to lay down and rest? ",A1d4n_18,self.Exercise,1539967702

# The Complete Guide To Treating &amp; Coping With Alzheimer’s Disease

About the Author

&amp;#x200B;

## What To Do When “Old-Timers Disease” Is No Longer Just A Joke

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a good bet that you, like the rest of us, have forgotten something and then, jokingly, said, “it must be old-timers disease.”

We didn’t mean to be hurtful, but our comment can cut deeply if there is a person present who is trying to cope with the disease.

With more than 18 million known cases of Alzheimer’s Disease world-wide, the odds are that you have had some contact with someone who is close to this horribly degenerating disease.  
It may be a victim or a family member of a victim.

Maybe you even suspect that a loved one is exhibiting early stage symptoms of Dementia and/or Alzheimer’s Disease.  If you think that may be the case, ***The Complete Guide to Treating &amp; Coping with Alzheimer’s Disease*** is just what you need.

Learning what you need to know to understand the disease gives you a definite road map for how to cope, not only with the disease but with caring for your loved one.

Alzheimer’s Disease is actually a form of dementia.  What comes first – dementia or Alzheimer’s?  There are many conditions being investigated as possible causes of Alzheimer’s Disease.

 We are still exploring the possible causes of Alzheimer’s Disease.

This disease affects vital areas of the patient’s brain with serious effects on those parts which control long-term memory, motion, reasoning and thought.

If you suspect that a friend or family member is suffering from Alzheimer’s, early detection is critical.

### No matter what your situation is, you will find the answers you need right here:

Need to identify the symptoms?. . .Chapter 5 breaks it down for you into the three types of symptoms:  early, developing and serious

There are 10 early warning signs and you can learn more about them in Chapter 6

Chapter 7 outlines the different stages of Alzheimer’s Disease

Did you know that estrogen plays a role for women in regards to this disease?  Chapter 10 explains it for you.

Discover how important early signs can be in Chapter 11.

Do you need to learn better ways to communicate with an Alzheimer’s patient?  Chapter 26 teaches you how to do that effectively.

How to care for an Alzheimer’s patient without sacrificing your own health can be learned in Chapter 31.

Does your friend or family member exhibit signs of uncertainty when attempting simple, routine tasks?  Are behavioral patterns escalating to borderline violence?  Is there a family history of dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease?

Any or all of the above could just be normal signs of aging.  However, why take the risk?  Don’t wait until it’s too late.

Get the answers you need now!

The Complete Guide to Treating &amp; Coping with Alzheimer’s Disease is not a replacement for sound medical advice. It IS a comprehensive outline designed to help you explore the options for diagnosis and ongoing care if your loved one is afflicted.

### Simple Swimming Guide – How to Live Your Life With Gusto!

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Reader,

Well, which are you?  Are you a “toe dipper” or do you approach it with enthusiasm?  Or maybe you are someone who never learned how to swim at all?  If the latter is the case, then roll up your sleeves because we have some work to do.

No matter if you are a newcomer to swimming or you are an old friend returning to a great sport, there’s something about swimming that, well, just gets under your skin.

Maybe you’ll never make the Olympics but that’s not really what it’s all about anyway, is it?  It’s about getting yourself back to good health.  
You won’t find a better vehicle for that journey than swimming.

Forget about the fancy smancy running shoes.  Never mind spending a mint on golf clubs that will  probably gather dust in a closet somewhere.  Arm yourself with last year’s swimsuit, a towel and a few bucks and head off to the local YMCA.

If you have it and want to spend it, drive over to the country club and join the group there.  You’ll probably have more fun at the “Y” though, especially if you can get a friend to go along with you.

If you have made a decision to do something about your health, swimming is the best exercise regimen you could select.  It’s low impact and easy on the joints.

If you feel like crawling out of the “couch potato” syndrome, what better method to do it. And, it needn’t cost you an arm and a leg.  As we just mentioned, the YMCA has a pool you can use at a very low cost.

### Did You Know?

[ Diets are not a “one size fits all”, and each person is an individual with different DNA, different metabolism, different health issues, and that’s before we get started with age, gender, height, weight, and activity level!

    BOOK PREVIEW

# We’ve Done the Research So You Don’t Have to!

&amp;#x200B;

By Lyndsey Morgan 

&amp;#x200B;

## Fed Up Trying To Lose Weight, Bouncing from Diet to Diet?

Over 70% of dieters keep choosing the wrong diet and that’s why people can’t lose weight!

New Research has shown that not everybody responds the same to structured diets!  You can have two people who are the same build, same weight, same height, and same age, that go on the SAME diet, but only one will lose weight and the other person barely shifts a pound or two.

**Why is that?**

Studies have shown that the difference lies simply in our DNA.  Nowadays you can send your DNA to a nutrition lab and have them tell you which type of diet would be best for you and aid in the most weight loss.  It sounds a bit hokey, but results have proven the claims to be true.

Now we’re not suggesting you send in your DNA to any lab, that’s up to you.

The thing is, if you’ve been around the diet block multiple times, you probably already know which types of diets have worked best for you in the past.

You probably already know if you can’t do Atkins, for example, like me.  I have NEVER been able to lose weight on that diet but have lots of clients that have and love it!  Thousands of people rave about the diet.  I’m that other person it doesn’t work for.  My DNA refuses to lose weight unless it’s eating low-fat and low-glycemic foods.

### Now even if you haven’t dieted before, how do you begin to figure out which diet plan to choose?

There’s so many diets on the market, and intuitively you already know which types of foods your body needs.  And, you ***also know which foods you are not willing to give up, unless there are other compensations!***

**You already know whether you have a weakness for sweets or savory things like cheese.**  But how do you find the right diet for you where *you will actually lose weight and enjoy it too?*

**“It Just Makes Sense to Find the Right Diet that** ***WORKS*** **for** ***YOU,*** **not your friends!”**

Well, we’ve got the answers for you!  We’ve done the research, so you don’t have to.

Written by a Certified Personal Trainer, and *previous* chronic dieter, Lyndsey Morgan has put together a book condensing many of the top diets of 2018, plus many more older ones, that give you “insight at a glance” whether or not the diet is suitable to your lifestyle, budget, and weight-loss needs.

* Stop bouncing from diet to diet
* Find out what works for you and will fit into your lifestyle
* Learn the Pros and Cons of today’s diets and what people think!
* Give yourself the chance to diet successfully and be happy!

I'm new here, so please forgive any hiccups in decorum!

I'm a 22 year old male who's been trying to lose weight via diet and exercise for about a year now. So far, things have gone quite well. At my heaviest, I weighed around 325 lbs., but am currently about 250 lbs. My diet is okay-- honestly, it isn't perfect but I know what needs to be changed.

My gym routine seems to have worked for weight loss as well, but as of late, my schedule hasn't allowed me to stay for as long as my routine typically takes (50mins to an hour). In addition, I've noticed my morale slipping as the routine begins to feel more monotonous. I'll leave the routine down below, and if you guys have any advice on what I can do to change things up while still doing enough to lose weight healthily, I'd so appreciate it.

I also feel I should note here that I started doing this routine under the guidance of a worker at my school's gym.

**Moderate intensity day**

1. .5 mile jog
2. 2000 meter row (on 7 resistance)
3. 3 sets of 20 on 3 different machines (these change depending on what I'm working on, but I do have 3 set machines I use for each group, if that makes sense)
4. 2000 meter row (on 7 resistance)
5. .5 mile jog

**High intensity day**

1. .5 mile jog
2. 1000 meter row (on 9 resistance)

Exercise,How do I incorporate more strength training when I’m partial to cardio?,"Hi, hope this post is okay here. I’m a runner- I got into it years ago to lose weight and ended up absolutely loving it. When I’m running I feel great and the calm/grounded feeling I get after is fantastic. 

However, I’d really like to incorporate more strength training into my workout regimen. The issue is that when I use weights, I just don’t get the same feeling when I’m doing them or after and it makes it difficult to keep up a consistent routine. That and I believe I’m constantly injuring myself with weights- I seem to always have horrible neck pain for a few days after. I’m assuming that has to do with improper form.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Are free weights the best way to go for strength training or do body weight exercises work just as well? I know these questions might seem silly but when I google I get a lot of conflicting information and it’s hard to tell what’s what.

Thanks in advance.",Deathriot89,self.Exercise,1538729930

Exercise,Almost died trying to get healthy,"I have been feeling very fat and out of shape lately.
Today, I broke out my old Turbo Jam DVD and thought, "" I'll just start with the 20 minute workout. Shouldnt be so bad.""

I made it ten minutes, probably less before I was red in the face, out if breath and feeling the burn. Even sent a video to my bf to show him how funny and fat I am. Did not make the 20 minutes, collapsed on the floor and recooperated.

Fast forward a couple hours after, on the couch, my hand goes pins and needles numb. Start freaking out, call boyfriend. Numbness travels up to my face and tongue. Y'all, i thought i was having a stroke or heart attack. Bf is scared. Call nurse mom. She calms me down, assuring me it must be some nerves acting up or maybe even lactic acid. Stretch and relax.

It worked, but bf came busting in from work to make sure i was alive, since i didnt answer him while on the phone with my momma. I cried because i felt terrible for worrying everybody. False alarm!

Only me...

Short version: felt pins and needles after working out for the first time in a very very long time and I thought I was going to die but everything was okay.

I've been going to the gym as much as I can for the last month and a half (about 5 to 6 times a week) with the simple goals of running for 45 minutes and working 2 muscle groups. My goal is to to cut the fat and replace it with muscle and hopefully end up staying around 190 and be able to run hard for long amounts of time. I've been going till muscle failure with weights and have been averaging 5-6 miles a day. Problem is my muscles aren't sore the next day and I can go again. Which makes me feel like I'm not making gains. I'm trying to lift heavy and do 3 sets of 10 and then a lighter burn out rep but feel nothing the next day. Then the second I spread out my workout a little and do a little more i'm to sore to work that muscle group again for several days.


Tldr: I feel like I can't find the middle ground between to much and not enough when I'm lifting weights.

Exercise,"Potentially lifestyle ending activity, advice needed...","Apparently I cannot ask for advice on r/fitness, and this post was deleted, so trying here....I’M NOT ASKING FOR ADVICE THAT WOULD GO AGAINST MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, I’M SEEKING ADVICE ON HOW PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOMETHING NEW, WHEN THEY LOST THE ABILITY TO DO AN ACTIVITY THEY LOVED.

TLDR: Has anyone been part of an activity that they had to stop because of an injury (or anything) and found something new that they loved? Any advice for me to keep me from slipping down this rabbit hole of depression?

BACKSTORY Three weeks ago I landed wrong rock climbing and wrecked my ankle. Originally the doc said it was “just broken” and that it was in place, so boot for a month or so, PT, and then I’d be back training (rock climbing and obstacle course racing) by December/January.

That alone was heartbreaking, but then I read my MRI results (which weren’t officially read by the radiologist when I met with my doc.)

Apparently it’s really bad. A bad break, and pretty much most, if not all of the must crucial ligaments are strained/damaged and possible torn.

Now I’m devastated.

I grew as the child of the generation where “you can wiggle your [insert body part] it ain’t broken. So I “sucked up” a lot of sprains and breaks in my childhood. I was constantly spraining my ankles and wrists.

I’ve been pretty active for the last 6 years— crossfit, weight lifting, running, rock climbing, yoga, etc. and did all of it with some pretty chronic pain. I have a lot of arthritis (I am in my 50s) probably due to the teenage injuries that weren’t treated. I stopped crossfit because when I would say “I can’t do X” (because of the pain) I was told, “we don’t say ‘can’t’, we say ‘won’t’.”

I have terrible knees and that’s the reason I broke my ankle. I was jumping down from a climb (sigh, again, because everyone was saying, “Jump, don’t down climb, you need to learn to not be afraid of jumping and falling) so I jumped and out of habit, put more weight on my one leg to protect my knee. Unbalanced, my ankle buckled upon impact.

So all of this is to ask— what’s next?

What options would you offer up once I’m able to start working out. I’m afraid that rock climbing and obstacle course racing are behind me and I’m not in a place where I can see other options.

Biking scares me—I was run off the road once.

I love being active. It really helps my mental health. I’m constantly battling anxiety and depression and my activities went a long way to keeping that at bay. I constantly struggle with my weight and even as active as I am, am overweight and look out of shape.

I know it’s early and I shouldn’t take anything off the table, but I need something to potentially look forward to. Right now, just thinking of climbing gives me flashback to my jump.

Exercise,Looking for suggestions to ramp up my walking,"Hi y'all, I'm hoping I can find some answers here. For the past three years, I take my daughter on a 2.1 mile walk every morning in a jogging stroller. We've done this since she was six months old. I've been adding dumbbells to a backpack, and to the stroller in order to maximize my workout since I only have 30 minutes to walk each morning before work.

This worked really well for me over the years, but now I feel I've reach a bit of a plateau. My stroller is technically only supposed to hold 50 pounds, but we're well over that. I don't want to add anymore weight to the stroller, because I don't know how much more it can take! But I need a way to make my walks harder.

I don't want to jog. I'm a pretty busty girl, and finding bras is really hard for me. And I don't want the pressure on my joints.
So can anyone think of ways I can ramp up my walks? I think I currently have about 80 pounds in my stroller (including my daughter) and 12 pounds in my backpack. If I add anymore than that, it hurts my back.

I appreciate your time! Thank you!",susie_grace,self.Exercise,1536786386

I've avoided going to the gym in the past because payments are a lot and it's usually far out of the way from where I live. But now I can go on campus and attend classes plus it's paid for so might as well use it. 

I would like to tone my stomach and get rid of my love handles. I guess lose some weight too but I know that the muscle I gain will probably be heavier, so really I just want to look better in those areas.

I also was hoping to get advice on how to stay motivated when you go to the gym alone. I honestly find it so awkward being there and don't like being looked at by other people especially since I don't know much about the equipment or what I'm doing. I always feel like people are looking saying ""damn she's doing that way wrong"" but I don't know. It's dumb anxiety I know but how do I over come it enough to walk into the gym and be able to just work out. I'd like to find a work out buddy to go with but so far haven't made any friends to do that.

Exercise,How do you stay motivated? Any tips for exercise with an old injury? Advice please.,"Hi all! I'm new here and hoping you awesome redditers can advise me.
A bit of background, I'm a mum to a very energetic two year old, I have a good diet (I think!) and I'm almost where I want to be with my weight but I really want to tone up and generally get fitter and improve my core strength.
I'm fairly active (I volunteer at a stables 4 days a week, horse ride 2 days a week and swim once a week) but I think my body has got used to this so it's not enough. I have to be slightly careful as I have an old ankle injury that flairs up with certain exercises like jogging, cycling and skipping (even with an ankle support on) which is a shame because I enjoy all of the above. I also have tendonitis in one of my wrists and I'm currently wearing a splint which helps greatly but it gets in the way a bit!
I can't afford to go to the gym and I'm generally exhausted by the end of the day.
Are there any exercises that are good for toning  but not too strenuous on the ankles?
Also, how do you stay motivated and keep it up? My other problem is that I give up too easily and I need to put a stop that!

Exercise,I'm 18.. and recently realized that 1.80 is not tall enough. Any tips on height gain?,"Seriously 1.80 is short... I dunno what you guys think but the ideal height is between 1.85 - 1.90

I'm not even 1.80 when I'm not wearing shoes.. technically I'm about 1.77 :(

That's just short. And I'm not happy with that.

Obviously i don't really have issues with that right now.. considering I'm not even 70kg but when i grow older and gain muscle.. i will look pretty short. And be pretty limited on how much muscle i can build.

The my dad is 1.90, my older brother is about 1.88, my younger brother is 1.93, and my 5 year older brother is 1.78+ or so. (all that without shoes)

Which means I'm even the shortest in the family.

So as I'm 18yo about a month now.. i was hoping it isn't too late for me to gain like 5cm or more.. So that i don't feel bad about my height literally every time i think about it.

I would be happy with being 1.85 without shoes. That would be perfect.

So for that i need to gain about 8cm in height. I honestly believe its possible but i don't know how.

My plan right now is to just drink 4 glasses of milk per day. My brother did that every day and got to 1.93. (i did that too but not at 16.. i did it at 14-15)

Cant say that its what made me taller but considering my brother overdosed on milk and got to be the tallest in the family.. i gotta try drinking at least 4 glasses of milk per day.

1 in the morning, 1 after launch, 1 in the afternoon and 1 before going to bed. Its really not that big of a deal. I believe it will work. I just really hope that i will actually gain enough height and not just like 1-2cm... :/

Other than drinking milk i will stretch for minutes every day whenever i remember (could mean 4 times a day - especially before going to bed)

Other than that my brother(1.93).. is pretty skinny.. So i also intent on losing about 7 kg, which is a lot.

Exercise,Getting fit (noob),"So I’ve gained quite a bit of weight over the summer and have started exercising a bit. However, I’m not entirely sure I’m going in the right direction. 

I’m not looking to get jacked, but rather have a toned body as opposed to one that is started to resemble a water bed. 

I haven’t gotten to the point where I exercise at least 5 times a day, but I do think I’m over the point where my body gets very sore the day/2nd day after. 

My diet isn’t on point yet, but it’s a hell of a lot better than before. I’ve decreased a lot of carbs and sugar. No more Soda! Well aside from at most once a week. Soda was/is probably my biggest weakness. 

As for what I do: I have dumbbells that are 10kg and I’ve been doing the “10 best dumbbell exercises” from [men’s health](http://www.menshealth.co.uk/building-muscle/the-10-best-dumbbell-exercises). As well as a bit more combinations with said dumbbells. Unfortunately they are still fairly heavy for me and I cant do a heap of reps. Sometimes I do push-ups, but not as much as I should and get tired very quickly from them (about 10 reps only 1 set). No cardio and some stretching before hand. I also always eat something high in protein after the workout as well. 

What I think I should be doing better: A wider variety of exercises (someone just posted something about abs and different types of styles that I saved). Cardio, I am definitely lacking there. I walk a lot everyday, but that is just walking. The reason for no running is because I tore the meniscus in my left knee and that was some painful shit. It still feels weak (this was almost a year ago). So I worry about that coming back. And my diet needs to be dialed in better. 

Anyway! I appreciate the hell out of anyone who would take the time to read this as well as any feedback; and from what I already know is the more muscle I can build up everywhere, the quicker the fat will go away. ",Billy01324,self.Exercise,1535380688

Exercise,some help?,"let me start off by saying I never really worked out before a few monhs ago, I'm pretty young but I decided to start. I'm a guy, my height is around 5'11""-6'0"" and I weigh 130-135 pounds (pretty lengthy lol) and I'm 16. I wanted to start working out cause I hated being weak and decided that through this people will stop looking at me as some scrawny kid (not anorexic looking, just not too strong). I don't have my license or a car yet and I'm in the process of getting a job for a gym membership (if I decide I want to) so all I have is stuff at home.

I have a single 10 pound weight and a park next to me that has pull up bars. I do things like push ups, sit ups, tricep dips, bicep curling, pull ups, hammer curls, etc.

the weight isn't that big but by doing a lot it gets tiring (like 1.5 to 2 hours a day). I can push through being sore, but it gets to a point where I'm so sore I can't do things like push ups anymore without my arms shaking and barely lifting myself. then I'll go back to do more and I can barely do them. I'll wake up the next day and get back to it and I'll get tired and sore so fast (I give myself 2 rest days a week, 3 days sometimes depending on if I'm very sore or not.) I've been doing my best for about almost 4 months now and it gets so hard now, I get so sore so quickly. I used to be able to get through my 2 hours a day but now my muscles get so tired it's way harder, is that just something I have to push through? I am really trying to eat more and I bought protien powder and make shakes for a pre-workout drink every day, but it seems like I'm not gaining weight either no matter how much I eat. it's probably just cause I'm not eating enough and I've tried spacing it out (I read online it helps your stomach digest food faster by putting less in it at a time or something like that which allows you to eat more) but it still seems like I'm not gaining weight.

my question is am I doing too much in a day? or maybe make it less days but do the same? I don't want to change anything without knowing why my muscles get so tired so fast now. it makes it really hard to finish the work out",RivenTheExil3,self.Exercise,1534702408

Exercise,"Improvements to diet, increase in exercise: No real results. Suggestions?","I'm attempting to go from Couch Potato to something that resembles a human person. 

Today is my 14th day in a row eating in a caloric deficit. I cut out sugar, processed and starchy foods such as rice, bread, and anything with flour. I eat fresh food, nothing from a can or bag. 

Between 60-100oz of water a day. 

My diet consists of lean meats (chicken and fish), protein shakes (low calorie, low carb), and a lot of vegetables (mostly dark green). (Calorie limit: 1400). 

I exercise twice a day for 30 minutes at a time. 

My morning routine : I work on arms legs and butt every morning for 30 minutes. I break out in a heavy sweat. Just to name a few exercises: 
-russian twists 
- mounting climbers 
-burpees
- push ups 
-planks
-wall sits 

I jog/ run/ walk every afternoon in intervals. 
1.30 minute walk 
1 minute jog 
15 second Sprint. 
Rinse/ repeat for 30 minutes. 

I have exercised this routing 10 of the 14 days. 

Within the last two weeks my weight has been as follows 

Day 1: 171 pounds 
Day 4 : 170
Day 8: 169.4
Day 10:169.8
Day 12:166.8
Day 14: 170

with such drastic changes to my diet, eating in a caloric deficit, and exercising every single day // why am I not seeing lasting results on the scale?

Exercise,Best way to gain abs?,"I eat well, I’ve started going to the gym 3 times a week, and when I leave my body aches. I’ve already got the abs building (and I can feel them), my issue is that I cannot push my stomach, I do various abdominal exercises daily, rowboats, crunches, bicycle cruches, sit ups, everything, and I will push myself until I feel like I might be sick, and my stomach will ache afterwards. Unfortunately where my legs will ache the day after a legs/bum/tum workout, my stomach will be fine in the morning. How can I push my stomach further to actually make the gains? My only limits right now is adding too many weights as I have golfers elbow (nerve damage to the humerus) in my left elbow and until I can build more strength in the elbow even lifting 15KG, which is fairly light for me, can make me unable to move my arm properly for the next day.

Just in case, my normal diet is: 
- Breakfast, a smoothie/juice of some kind, normally spinach &amp; kale with some chia seeds and a splash of apple juice and water
- Lunch, a protein (normally chicken) with either brown rice or gluten free pasta
- Dinner, a small portion of carbs (gluten free) with some meat and veg

If I want to snack in the day time I will tend to eat peppers or cucumber, or just drink some water, I don’t add salt to my food, and I’m lactose and gluten intolerant so I’ve cut them out of my diet too. I will generally try to add some kind of fruit to my smoothies too to make it at least 3 portions of fruit/veg, I drink 2-3 litres of water daily and I’m cutting out alcohol and fizzy drinks.",thefabulousbomb,self.Exercise,1534458524

Exercise,I am not sure whether to continue a certain exercise or not,"Hello. I'm having an issue. I've just recently started exercising after an *extremely* sedentary lifestyle. I'm trying to go slow and gentle but I have encountered a problem:  


After stretching and warming up, one of the final things I do is a 1 arm shoulder press, using no weight (I'm just practicing the motion + it already tires out my arm - like I said...sedentary). Unfortunately, the right half of my back lights up and burns. I have issues from past injuries with it but when I have spoken to a doctor he said they can't see anything in scans so it's just a strained muscle or something and send me on my way with no real other advice. It's been like this for 2 years or so I would guess. 

My question is: if it's pain I know isn't dangerous / is chronic, should I try to deal with it and continue (gently) with this exercise? Or should I stop / do something else? ",freshairinforever,self.Exercise,1534225919

Exercise,Why do I feel 'low' the day after bootcamp?,"In the past four or five years I've noticed a demonstrable pattern relating to my exercise regime. I'm a 39 year old female, always pretty active and fit, and at different times have built up to doing three or four bootcamp sessions a week. Each session includes 25 to 35 minutes of moderate-to-intense exercise, mostly running and agility courses, body weight exercises, weights and ab work. It's a great workout and I feel good directly afterward but the next day I feel I not just tired but genuinely low and listless. It feels chemical. Then if I back it up and do bootcamp two nights in a row the day after I feel even worse, almost completely demoralised and hopeless. It feels a lot like the relentless negativity of depression and at times it affects my work. 

Now that I'm aware this is going to happen (it always does) I can recognise the feelings and know they are temporary and all it takes is a night off exercise to return me to feeling upbeat and normal the day after. 

It happened again this week and although I'm glad I'm smashing bootcamp and losing weight and feeling fitter I'm getting sick of the super low moods. Am I not eating the right things? I eat pretty well although not much meat (I have tofu, cheese, fake meats for protein). I also sleep well and am in good spirits aside from the day after bootcamp. :/ 

I saw a post from a few months ago about exercise causing depression but that seemed to be related to a really strict new regime and a new diet. This is not a new regime for me, it's established and always has the same result. 

Any ideas?? Should I be eating/drinking something specific after bootcamp? I feel like dopamine is involved somehow. ",LadyKnope,self.Exercise,1533891639

Exercise,Different Ways To Relieve Bloated Stomach," Is your stomach bloated? If so do not feel alone, there are many of us who suffer from a bloated stomach. But what exactly causes it and how to relieve bloated stomach?

Firstly, a bloated belly can be the result of several different factors, or a combination of some or all of them. In our fast paced lifestyles a lot of people these days are turning to foods that are more convenient and fast. Unfortunately, these types of foods are leading to a vast array of health issues, up to and including obesity.

And obesity, or being overweight, is a primary reason the stomach becomes distended. A thick layer of fat slowly forms around the middle until the stomach region looks big and overly swollen.

Other factors may also include medical issues such as hernia or extreme indigestion related problems including the build up of gasses, all of which give the stomach a bloated look. If our digestion becomes very irregular, than gas will form at a much higher rate and that leads to bloating.

**What are the symptoms of a bloated stomach?**

If you feel enormous pressure in the stomach, or suffer with stomach cramps that are excessive, chances are you are feeling the effects of a bloated stomach. Additionally, you may feel uncomfortable in the clothes you are wearing as they might start to feel overly tight.

**Any tips to relieve bloated stomach?**

The first thing to do is identify which foods or liquids are causing the problem. Are you lactose intolerant? Do rich spicy foods give you heartburn and indigestion? Unfortunately some of the foods we eat and enjoy the most are at the root of the problem.

Seek medical assistance if you continue to suffer with a bloated stomach. There are medications that can give you quick relief. A skilled dietitian can also assist you greatly in formulating the right eating plan to suit your body. Try to cut down on the high fat foods that tempt us each and every day. By following these simple guidelines, you can certainly get your bloated stomach back in control.

Exercise,Opinions on my workouts please! :),"Hey there ,
I have recently started a weight loss journey with the help of a local women’s studio I have where I live.
I know the best way to lose fat is lifting weights and cardio and I’ve been wondering if the following workouts count ..
1. Total body - this workout is a 45 mins workout that includes 15 different stations 3 of them are cardio(jumping jacks and such) and the rest are different machines.(smith machine ,pulley, dumbbell squats ,lunges etc)we repeat each station 3 times total(3 rounds)
2.Another cycle workout , this time it’s 10-15 stations (can’t remember correctly)
During this workout I do 1 minute cardio and 1 minute lifting weights, we repeat this cycle twice . 

These two workouts are considered as the “ gaining muscle” workouts in my studio.. what do you think of them ?
another workout we have is just a studio workout that includes some cardio to get our heart rate up and then we do a lot of body weight exercises (squats ,lunges,planks ,etc) some of these exercises include light weights ..

My goal eventually is to get a gym membership and lift weights the standard way but I don’t trust myself just yet and this studio helps me get my butt off the sofa also those are quick workouts of 1 hour max while at the gym I can burn off 2 hours easily..
Thanks a lot for your opinions :)) ",confusedlikesome,self.Exercise,1533415834

Exercise,METs and Daily Exercise,"METs confuse me. Beyond the formula to determine METs, there seems to be confusion on how many METs one needs to expend in a week/month.

This article: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180723142920.htm
just makes my head hurt. SUPPOSEDLY, if you expend MORE than 5000 METs in a week/month (the study says week in one place, month in another), you not only lose weight, but stave off Chronic Illness as you age.

All fine and good, but 5000 METs is an ungodly number even for a month (at 1250 METs/week or about 179 METs/day) when the charts I see state that running only burns about 15 METs/hour at 15 MPH.

The article discusses exercise and the elderly.
How many non-elderly can run 10 hours a week @ 15MPH?
For comparison, sitting only uses 1 MET/hr...

So, please help the stupid (me).
given 8 hrs day @ 1 MET (assuming sleep is no more active than sitting), I still need to burn 171 METs a day...Basically 10 METs/hr for 16 hours (avg)?

This seems impossible, but it could just be me trying for an excuse to just sit...Those who regularly work out can probably hit 1000 METs/wk with no problem. But us older folk move slower to start with. How can I move enough to do 170 METs a day?

Exercise,Calories burned exercising vs doing nothing,"I remeber reading somewhere that the alleged number of average calories burned doing an exercise can be misleading.  I think it's called something like ""mean caloric"" something.  Basically the post suggested that if an exercise is touted to burn 300 calories, readers can be mislead into thinking that they burn 300 cals in addition to what they burn in the course of the day.  However, that number includes the total amount of cals burned during the course of the exercise (for simple math sake we'll say 1 hour).  However, if you did nothing but watch tv during that hour you would still burn X cals (let's say 150). I don't remeber how much the difference is but I do remember that the numbers were a little disonserting.  It can be discouraging to people to find out they only burned an additional 150 cals (arbitrary number for illustration) for all their hard work vs doing nothing.  This, and the fact it's harder to market an exercise program with lower numbers, makes it harder to find the true number of cals one is burning in addition to the cals he/she would burn regardless. Regardless, I like to know what I truly need to do to reach certain goals.  I prefer the unfiltered truth regardless of how demotivating it may seem.  I believe the other just lends itself to be a delayed demotivater and can eventually lead someone to the, ""well I was supposedly burning 2,500 cals a day and it didn't do for me what it was supposed to"" and quit when in reality that person may have burned 2,000 cals or less.  So my question, how does one figure out how many cals he/she burned for a specific exercise vs doing nothing for that period of time?  Or stated another way: how many cals does one burn solely from the extra effort of a particular exercise?",Kduke402,self.Exercise,1532720832

Exercise,Exercise for Beginners - Men and Women,"If you're a beginner and looking to start an exercise program its important to be aware of the different types of exercise training, the forms of exercise conditioning and which exercises a beginner should start with before moving on to more advanced exercise routines or equipment.

A good basic overview of the exercise essentials for beginners is to outline the various forms of exercise in an easy and simple format.

1. Aerobic exercise works the cardiovascular system of the body and helps to speed up the body's metabolism. It is an important part of any weight reduction program. A good rule of thumb on exercise for beginners is to start aerobic activity slowly and build up as you improve you fitness levels.

2. Strength training (resistance or weight training) involves gym or weight based workouts that focus on exercising the different muscles of the body. This type of training can be focused on simple maintenance, conditioning or strength and weight gain. It also greatly assists in weight reduction. If your just starting out its important to learn how to do the exercises correctly, which body parts they exercise and how many repetitions and sets you should perform.

There are other more specific exercise and fitness components such as flexibility training but this is a more advanced subject that is more relevant to professional athletes or individuals looking for improved sports performance. At the beginner level, individuals need to focus on getting a basic understanding of stretching and muscle preparation prior to engaging in aerobic exercise or strength based conditioning. Performing stretching prior to workout commencement not only prepares your body for more intense forms of exercise but greatly assists in improving your overall flexibility.

If you're a beginner and not sure where to start, you can purchase a basic exercise book which will introduce you to some simple stretches, weight training and provide some additional guidelines for aerobic training. A simple way to get a good introduction to exercise essentials for beginners is to join the local gym and have a professional instructor walk you through the various exercises. This is a great way to learn by doing and is a quick way to for any beginner to get started and build up to a level where you can modify and design your own exercise workouts. 

An important aspect of health and fitness that beginners should investigate is how exercise and nutrition works together. The [exercise and nutrition](https://planetsupplement.com/muscle-building-nutrition-plan/) section of this website has additional information on this.

## Exercise for women

If your a female looking to start an exercise program, it's not difficult to come up with some creative ways to get started. Whether you want to do exercise from home, create a social group focused on exercise for women or join a gym, getting setup with an exercise routine is as simple as starting out by walking and building up the pace as your tolerance levels improve.

The range of exercises available to women is limited only by your imagination but is better defined by your personal goals and objectives. Start out by walking, or, if you want to do your exercise at home, a skipping rope or some exercise equipment can be purchased and used to start your initial fitness program.

Some women like to combine a social aspect to their exercise routine so forming walking groups or attending aerobic workouts at your local gym provide a way to socialize with other individuals in a low key way with people who have similar objectives.

If you want to investigate total body conditioning, then consider joining a gym and soliciting the advice of a fitness professional who can introduce you to additional exercises for women, walk you through the mechanics, and provide ongoing consultation tailored to your objectives and body condition.

Home exercise for women can be scheduled around daily lifestyle requirements by appropriate use of fitness equipment, video's that are designed with specific exercises for women, stretching and other activities such as a skipping rope that can be operated effectively from the confines of your home environment. If you need additional advice, consider hiring a fitness professional who can tailor a set of exercises to suit the equipment you have available and your total body and exercise objectives.

Outdoor sporting activities or group based exercise for women can be organized by putting together a group of like minded individuals who can meet on a regular basis. This is a great way to socialize and do your regular exercise at the same time.   


## Exercise for men

There are many different options available for men who want to exercise or start a fitness program. To determine the best form of exercise for men you really need to be able to define your objectives.

Men who have been living a sedimentary lifestyle will benefit from any form of exercise and the best exercise for men in this situation is to simply start a regular exercise program. Running or walking is an ideal place to start and by building a basic foundation you can move onto other areas or activities that are more intensive.

If your interested in total body conditioning then consider joining the local gym. You can seek the advice of a qualified fitness professional who can introduce you to a range of exercises for men, walk you through the mechanics and provide ongoing consultation and advice specifically geared towards your exercise objectives. This is often a great way to learn and work towards getting a better understanding of the range of exercises available for men and to get advice on designing an exercise workout program.

If your busy with work commitments, then consider scheduling your exercise workout during you daily lunch break. You can use facilities that are located close to where you work or simply hit the pavement and go for a run. If your tight on time then you need to learn more about the economy of exercise. This is a concept that can be employed once you have some basic conditioning levels in place. This involves short, sharp, intensive exercise programs that can be performed in a very short period of time. You might be surprise to know that a very effective exercise program for men can be performed in as little as 20 minutes.",PlanetSupplement,self.Exercise,1532109474

Exercise,Orange Theory censorship of Partner workout complaints,"I signed up for Orange Theory Fitness in Kingston MA on Saturday and got up this morning at 4:15 am, excited to go to a workout where I could go at my own pace while working in a structured pace.

Instead they had something called a partner workout, which involves constantly rotating among the weights, rower, and treadmill with two other partners.  The partners have to finish where the other left off. 
 First, this is gross because there is no time to clean the machines.  Second, it goes against OTF's brand.  They sell you on everyone going at their own pace.  For example, I was told that the classes included people who were training for marathons and those just trying to get in shape.  I am definitely in the latter group and at 5 am in the morning, the last thing that I want to do is coordinate with someone else or worry about whether they have to finish my lifts or my running distance.

I had done so much research on OTF and everything I read emphasized going at your own pace, no one bothering you during your workout, etc.  Consequently, I was so upset to find out about this parter workout.  A simple Google search of ""Orange Theory partner workouts"" showed that I was not alone.  I found all these complaints online, especially on reddit.  To be fair, some people like them, but there are many who do not, and it appears that some of the defenders many be OTF employees.

To read all the posts, I went to the Orange Theory Fitness subreddit and found that they were CENSORING complaints about the partner workouts.  Here's the post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/7we3a4/mod_note_partner_workout_posts_will_be_removed/?st=jjo46u0t&amp;sh=a6c91d9a

The moderator is deleting complaints about the partner workouts from the subreddit and then closed the post, so no one can comment on his/her decision to censor the the conversation.  Who knows how much of the discussion on this post itself was also removed.  There are many more positive comments about partner workouts than there are on the other conversations.

Does anyone know if the moderator is an Orange Theory employee? 

They seem to be trying to create a false impression of the wonders of OTF by censoring.  Of course, they do not say that they are censoring.  Instead, they say that they are trying to keep things positive so they don't drag anyone down (or inform anyone of the downsides of signing up for OTF).  Buyer cannot be aware on this subreddit.

""We all appreciate a good vent, but remember that the intention is for this to a positive, encouraging and productive space. Negativity and excessive or out of line complaints can bring down the otherwise motivating group! Be mindful that some studio specific problems and complaints about costs or one-off issues can be draining for the rest of us. Most of these issues should be brought to your studio managers or with corporate, not solved and aired here on this subreddit! (issues with coaches, Tech, HRM, Booking, Apps, etc)""

Exercise,Over did it today,"I don't exercise much. I'm a young adult who's metabolism guides my choices at this point of my life, but I felt that exercising would be good for a change. 

Now, I'm not demonizing exercising. Its a great thing to do, but I did it wrong.

This was my first day on a new exercise plan that focused on circuit training. Coming into this, I knew it was controversial and could be dangerous, but I felt that I could handle it being I'm so young. 

It began with some warmups, like all exercising does. Pull ups, dips, and pushups. About 25 each. Easy stuff. I broke a sweat and I was pumped. Then I moved onto circuit training. 

100 m sprint. After 3 laps around a small track, I felt ugh. I walk a lapped, and jogged the next two. At this point, I'm really pacing myself. Then I did 25 box jumps, and then 25, 25lbs kettlebell swings. At this point I was getting tired. Throughout all of this, I was drinking water of course, but I'm not sure it was enough. In addition to this, I was in the gyms basement with poor AC. 

Now, it was time for 25 situps. At this point, I needed a rest. I knew that this first time in this training could be rough, so I didn't bother sticking to the circuit rules. I sat there, maybe 10 minutes. Breathing. Then, I stood up. I made my way to the sit up bench, and nearly collapsed. I had my brother grab a trash can for me, and I just breathed. 

My vision went blury and my ears gave out. I could not hear or see anything. So I closed my eyes, concentrating on breathing. Gyms have that stigma behind them that almost everyone you meet there will antagonize you for whatever reason. Say you're chubby, or weak. Well, gym goers are actually very considerate. One guy turns on a fan for me, and another brings me water and keeps talking with me. This helped a lot! After a few minutes, I regained my sight and hearing and could walk upstairs for fresh air. 

This isn't me asking for medical advice or anything, instead this is a PSA to everyone who's looking to stay fit and exercise: Stay hydrated! If you're feeling sick, stop. Relax your body. Don't overdo it. Trust me, it sucks. ",SomeRedditUserDude,self.Exercise,1530387859
