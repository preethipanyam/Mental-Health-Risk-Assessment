happy,A small moment of learning and appreciation for the deaf community,"For clarification - both my boyfriend and I are hearing. 

My boyfriend and I were heading home from the airport last week. He called an Uber to come pick us up, and a notification popped up to let us know that our driver was deaf or hard of hearing (DHH). 

He mentioned this to me by saying “our driver has an impairment.” I mentioned that there’s actually a whole deaf culture that revolves around signing and that the DHH community that doesn’t necessarily view it as a disability or impairment, which is something I learned recently after doing an internship in DC that housed us near [Gallaudet University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallaudet_University). Shout out to the super cool community I got to meet while there!

Anyway, my boyfriend responded kind of grumpily during the exchange (which I chalked up to him being tired post flight) before listening for a bit more and ending with a “that’s pretty cool.”

Before long, our driver pulled up and we got in the car. During the ride, he was on his phone the whole time and didn’t really try to chat with me or anything. Again, chalked it up to him being tired, totally understandable.

Well, it turns out that he spent that time on his phone learning how to say “thank you” in sign language! As we got out, he signed “thank you” and the driver, who signed a “thank you” back to him.

It just makes me happy that I’m with someone who’s empathetic and thoughtful about his interactions. Wasn’t sure who to share this with IRL so I thought I’d share it with r/happy!",noketchup_rawsauce,self.happy,1554028601

happy,Hasan Minhaj said that I could open for him the next time he does stand-up in my city,"I'm a stand-up comedian in college. Recently, I've been really struggling with the fact that all of my friends already have jobs in banking and, despite applying to 80+ jobs, I have been rejected from every comedy job/internship I've applied for. 

Last night, Hasan Minhaj came to my college to talk about what it's like being South Asian and doing comedy. I wrote a comedy book about comedy last semester and I brought a copy of it, on the off chance that I run into Hasan and he wants it. It was a long shot, but I figured I wouldn't lose anything by bringing it. 

During the show, Hasan started working on a joke about people mispronouncing his name and asked the audience if he should add it to his stand-up routine. Everyone said yes and he responded with, ""but how would I start it off?"" Now, I don't usually do this, but I immediately came up with an lead-in for the joke and something told me to yell it out.

So I yelled out, ""introduce yourself."" Hasan and I then had a full conversation, which felt like a blur to be honest, about this joke. 750+ people were watching. I basically pitched the joke to him and somehow brought up that I do stand-up and wrote a book. I lifted up the book and passed it up the audience to Hasan and he accepted it! On top of that, he told me that I could open for him the next time he does stand-up in DC.

I caught his agent on my way out and she said that he is probably going to email me. I am so, so, so excited. 

Hasan was so nice and went above and beyond what, I think, anyone expected of him. It was the coolest thing to happen to me in a very long time. I'm never going to forget this. I've met a couple other comedians, and none of them were this nice. I am so happy.

happy,"After feeling like a failure for the past three months for not getting any jobs, I finally feel proud of myself again. I got a job!!","I (18F) have finally gotten my first job!! I graduated last year and am now in my first year of college so I have now been searching for a job. I have been feeling like a failure for the past few months while not being able to pay for things or do the things I want to do. I’ve hated having people pay for things, or to ask my parents for some cash. I started applying for jobs in January and wasn’t getting much positive feedback. 

I applied for DollarTree on January 1st and I never heard back from them. I then proceeded to apply to more places in hopes that at least one would answer. I applied for Chick-fil-A next, my boyfriend worked there and he had said that they were hiring so I should apply. I did, and I never heard back from them so my confidence in finding a job kept decreasing. I then applied as a hostess at Applebee’s, and still nothing. Next I sent an online application to Ross (clothing store) and within 10 minutes they responded with a “you didn’t get the job” email. At this point I was starting to feel extremely sad because I felt like no one would hire me because I had no past job experience.

This is when it happened. My boyfriend and I went to go see How to Train Your Dragon 3 at a local movie theater. As we were getting our tickets I noticed a “now hiring” sign on the window and thought it would be pretty cool to work there. So a few days later, I went back to get an application. I filled it out that night, and the next day I went to give it to them. I didn’t have much hope since the rest of my applications hadn’t gone too well. But the day after I gave it to them I got a call for an interview!! I set it up and went in and needless to say.. but I got the job!! I start today at 4 and I couldn’t be more excited! It finally gave me some confidence back and helped me see that I’m not a failure after all. My now boss boosted my spirits by telling me that he was going to hire me and one other person, but he still had to look through the other applications.. which means he didn’t give much thought to anyone else and he had hired me on the spot :)  

HERE’S TO NOT FEELING LIKE A FAILURE ANYMORE!!!

happy,Today is my 28th birthday and it’s been the best year of my life.,"I had a rocky start a year ago. My boyfriend left me a week before my bday, I was yelled out of the restaurant I worked at for 2 years and thrown out and called fucking useless by the owner, my anxiety was super high and I felt like I’ve done nothing with my life. I wouldn’t even acknowledge that it was my birthday last year because I was so down in the dumps. I decided to make some serious changes.
I had my last cigarette a year ago today, I have been with my wonderful boyfriend for nearly a year now. I made my circle of friends much smaller and have really paid attention to spending time with people who matter to me most. I went no contact with my mother whom I had a very toxic relationship with. Through that I have changed my perspective on life and instead of constantly victimizing myself I have been focusing on being productive, solving problems fast and over all bettering myself as a person. 
I accomplished a dream of mine to travel by myself for the first time to New Orleans which was amazing. I now work for my role model as her jr sous chef at a golf course and because of my amazing team I have had the best summer of my life. I have also been actively working on my art after a 2 year hiatus. My panic disorder has improved so much that I’ve only had a couple panic attacks in the past 6 months.
I hope to keep on this track for the upcoming year and I am honestly proud of myself for making the changes needed to improve my life. 
Cheers!",vikkokoro,self.happy,1564590929

happy,This one kid shattered my heart. My eyes sweated all day.,"Hello. Please take a moment out of your browsing day to read about this occassion that happened to me today.

I have been your typical reddit browser that did not have a reason to post up till today. This particular event that happened today just broke my heart and I just had to let the world know how much of a big heart this little boy had. Truly a heart of gold that I have never seen before. I may only be a student myself but I truly even wish to adopt him as my brother when the day comes that I can support him financially.

Background: I am a 4th year college student that has picked up a part time job for the summer just for side cash. I had a customer who looked like she was having a rough day. After learning she works at an orphange, I became acquainted with her and started volunteering. 


So after a solid two months of helping out, There were a total of 4 birthdays celebrated during my time here so far. At the latest birthday celebration, I couldnt help but notice this one child (8 years old) who just didnt look like he was truly enjoying the occasion like the other kids. While everyone gathered around the birthday kid who was opening presents, I saw said boy leave by himself.

I secretly followed him upstairs out of concern to his shared room and saw him crying under the sheets while singing ""happy birthday~ "" by himself. I ended up approaching him and asking what was the problem.

I learned that the boy's birthday celebration has never been celebrated at the orphange. I asked him why he wouldnt tell anyone, and he told me that it wasnt a big deal and it was better to save the money for the stuff the orphanage needs.

I ended up asking around and found out that the boy's birthday was erased because a name error caused another volunteer to erase his name from the birthday list thinking it was a misprint. Due to the large amount of children, it was too difficult to keep track of all their birthdays.

This boy spent eight years keeping his brithday only to himself just because he didnt want to be a bother to everyone. I asked him if he were to get a present what would he ask for. So he replied with "" a happy meal because we cant go out alot because there's too many of us.""  I knew that there was no way this was enough since I saw kids getting new shoes and clothes and other toys for their birthdays.

I left and came back the same day with a happy meal and a new Nintendo Switch with Breath of the Wild, and Smash Ultimate.

Best money I have ever spent.

Edit: will add a picture of the hero next volunteer shift if he doesnt mind.

TLDR: orphanage child kept this birthday to himself and celebrated to himself for eight years because he wanted to, quote : ""make sure we have enough to eat.""",kkanggpae,self.happy,1564549503

happy,"I bought headphones today with my own money. It’s the first legitimate +$100 purchase I have made in 3 years. I used to make six figures, then lost it all and went to jail. Now I’m slowly creeping back up and today was just a motivating day.","I literally started today off on the wrong foot.  I broke my leg running from a burglary scene two years ago and now I walk with a limp.  This morning I was walking down the stairs in my parents house tripped up and stumbled on my bad leg.  It hurt.  Instantly my mind went red.  YOU BROKE YOUR FUCKING LEG AND THIS IS WHAT YOU FUCKING GET.  FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE A DAILY REMINDER OF FUCKING UP YOUR WHOLE LIFE. 

It’s hard to not ride that shitty and depressed feeling throughout the day and feel sorry for myself.  Honestly though, I have no real right to feel that way.  I made all the decisions that got me to where I am today. I have no one to blame but myself.  I am lucky to be where I am at. I am lucky to be where I am at. I am grateful to be where I am at and it could be much worse.

I’m a recovering meth addict.  I’m slowly building things back up.  I’m not part of a twacked out fraud ring drug dealing anymore. I’m not high. I’m not ignoring those that care most about me anymore. 

I have been saving up money thanks to my parents that have been supportive of my recovery.  I surpassed my savings goal that I set out for myself that I wanted to have set aside before moving back out on my own.  

My wired headphones kept getting tangled in the elliptical that I do everyday at the gym.  I figured it was ok to spend a little money for a good product that I found a good price for.  It felt weird spending a lot of money again like this on something and it not being fraudulent.  I got so used to just being able to ring up whatever the fuck I wanted at a store.  For years I had more than enough money, then I would get shit on fraud.  Today, I have a new found respect for honest money.

Anyways... it felt weird buying something nice again and I realized it was because it was the first time in years that it wasn’t with drug money or fraud.  I just wanted to share this because It felt good and I also think it helps me with accountability type shit.",alphatweaker,self.happy,1564536840

Pulled it out along with my boarding pass and the TSA agent was looking at it. I said oh sorry I had that in there. He says “no problem! Either one works”. 

We started chatting and I asked him if the badge gives you TSA pre and he relayed a funny story of his own travels. Turns out he’s a veteran. Shook his hand and said thank you for your service. He fires back without batting an eyelid:

“No.  Thank YOU”. 

I almost bawled. Was totally unexpected.  

I worked hard all of my life to realize this dream of working at this particular branch of the government. It’s been there in my heart since I was 12.

I grew up in a very unhappy home where I did not feel loved or even liked. But my extended family on another continent have always welcomed me and loved me. The few times as a kid that we went over to their country to see them are the only real happy memories of my childhood. 

I left home as young as I could and made a happy home for myself and children with a very wonderful partner. We didn’t have much but we were happy. But we could never afford to travel and so my husband and children have ever met these wonderful relatives.

Recently my husband and I got really good jobs and now for a milestone birthday he is taking me to the homeland for a three week visit with this now spread out family. We will see most of them but can’t get everywhere to see everyone. But I am full of happiness and anticipation for those we will see.

Then this morning I woke up to a message from one of the kids of a second cousin who was on my list but too far away to visit. My great uncle, his two children and all their grown children are planning to travel down to spend the last day of my trip with us. I can’t believe it!

I was feeling down that night, and this stranger, just offered comfort and support. We bared our souls the first time we met.

We Skyped later, and it went on. The funny thing is we had both decided to never let our walls down before we met each other, and I had even written it down. And I lowkey hated the fact that things were not going to my plan. 

But this person, this gem of oa human being told me was so kind to me. We've both been emotionally abused, so we kinda both want to take care of each other and help each other grow.

happy,Just got a dream opportunity to make my own video game.,"I had a pretty rough high school experience, particularly early on. Depression, suicidal thoughts, yada yada yada. I knew from a really young age that I wanted to make video games, and it felt like high school was doing nothing but holding me back. It eventually got better as high school drew closer to a close, but damn was sophomore year especially rough.

Well eventually I went to college for game design and development and ooooh boy is it a different experience. Three years in and I’m still having an absolute blast, even with the difficult “weed out” courses. I can honestly say that I am exactly where I am meant to be. I do probably 4x as much work as in high school, but I feel like I’m so much more free.

But then it got even better. My school runs a program that gives grants to students so that they can work on a creative project full time for a semester. I figured I had nothing to lose, applied one of my game prototypes, and got the grant! I’ll be spending 4 months programming my own video game. And if it all goes well, it’ll be a killer entry to my portfolio and resume so it might even help me land a job with a game studio later on! It’s honestly surreal to think about. I’m so nervous and excited and happy. 

I really wish I could go back in time and tell sophomore-year me about this. He’d be absolutely blown away.",AstronautPuppies,self.happy,1575021012

Alright so I've been playing lol for a couple months not, over half a year through many accounts, two months ago I decided to stop making new accounts, today I finally got to level 30 on my main account and unlocked the ranked gamemode, so I started a game, and both teams were filled with gold players (for you that probably don't know, the ranked system has leagues that go, Iron Bronze Silver Gold Platinum Diamond Master Grandmaster Challenger, Gold players are already above the a average) On my first ranked game! I was super nervous but super thrilled, after the game was over one of the people on my team added me, I decided to accept, he then told me I looked promising and he wanted to add me to his secondary team, part of a small national lol team (As a top laner and in spain) I know every kid wants to be a pro gamer, but this has been my little secret that I never tell anyone, when asked what I want to be when I grow up I make an excuse like forensic science, but either way! I was super joyed to get invited, problem is, I don't live in spain, and I'm only gonna be 15 next month, so most likely I won't be able to join, I can't even imagine how I'd convince my parents to let me (They aren't too keen on videogames) but even if it doesn't work out I'm just super happy since I played against decent players and won, and then got invited to a team.

happy,I did a nice deed,"I live in an area where it doesn't rain often. Several months ago, I was walking to my car on campus and it rained much harder than usual. I was not prepared and soaked about halfway through my 10 minute walk. Someone pulled off to the side and rolled his window down, insisting I take his umbrella. He told me to do something nice for someone. I love making people happy and doing little things for people, even strangers. I can't think of another time someone has shocked me with their kindness.
I kept the umbrella in the trunk of my car, but we didn't get rain for a long time and I didn't see anyone that needed it. Today leaving work, I ran to my car in the rain. It was drizzling but nothing crazy. I turn left at a light to leave the parking lot and the center median in a pretty common spot for homeless folks to hang out with a sign. I know many of them by now and give them my leftover lunch stuff whenever I can. Today there was a younger guy I hadn't seen before with a dog and a sign that said ""Smile!"" My light was green and I'm in a center lane, so I pull through the intersection, park my car on a side road and run back to him with the umbrella and $10. Its Thanksgiving tomorrow, I wanted him to be comfortable and fed. He was really happy for the umbrella and I saw him open it up for himself as I was waiting to cross the street :') it started pouring when I got home and it's supposed to rain for 5 days straight.

He absolutely loves to cuddle. He sprawls himself across my tummy and lays his head down on my chest. He looks up at me while I scratch his head. His big eyes make me feel like I matter. He's so fluffy and soft, and it's so funny how he lays down totally flat on me.

My roomates, whom I've only known since August, bought me a cake! It doesn't seem like much, but it really means a lot to me. I honestly realise now how luck I am.

happy,I know people are struggling and I wish I could help but sometimes the universe just helps you out and today it helped me.,I've been out of work since January by my choice to take a fast track bootcamp that would teach me data analytics. I've about exhausted every dime I have and my credit cards are maxed. I have about 3 in a half weeks left in the program and I wasnt sure what I was going to do between now and the stimulus which I am beyond thankful for. I just got the mail for today and there was a letter from my bank. Enclosed was a check for 800$ for a gap insurance refund for my first car I totaled nearly 8 years ago. I am speechless I dont know what to think. I know it's not the case but i can only put it on my mom looking down and knowing i needed help. I knew nothing about such a refund or that I was owed anything. I mean gap insurance is to pay off your loan when you cant pay it so why would I be owed money? I'm in tears and just thanking her over and over and the universe too. I guess I had some good karma or something or maybe luck but I just needed to talk to someone about it. I hope everyone is ok and gets through this difficult time. I hope the universe helps you in some way soon for those struggling like me.

My recipie for happiness... be appreciative for what you have no matter how small. Never rely on material goods or other people (including SO, family, friends etc) to make you feel happy. Can you be happy by just looking up at the sky and looking at a cloud go by? Please smile more and be appreciative and humble and kind and charitable and work hard.

happy,Amazing Online Friends Through Video Games,"About a year ago, i was super into roblox and specifically this one roleplaying game. Anyways, they had a discord server so i decided to join and the people there were super nice, however there were a few people there who i talked to a lot. I wouldn't consider them my friends necessarily, but i guess they did. One night while we were talking, one guy suggested that we play cards against humanity. They were planning to make that a usual thing, so they made a discord server specifically for that, and to talk, play other games etc. We weren't allowed to post other links in the server so they were gonna dm the invite links. Now, i was not expecting to be invited, because like i said before, i didn't think of them as friends, but i did get the invite link :D

So we played CAH all night and it was super fun! We did this a few other times and i can't remember the reason as to why, but this one girl wanted to make a podcast and they were all up for it (including me). So they make the server and wanted to record an episode soon. They were asking for guests and while i would have loved to be on it, i have this really horrible mic that will literally stop working every now and then, and to be fair, i've always been self-conscious about my voice. We made a lot of new friends along the way, and all was well. One of the new people we met had made some remarks to the hosts of the podcast about killing themselves, wich got them banned from the server of course. Sadly enough, only went downhill from here :(

The hosts of the server are LGBTQ and two guys really didn't like the LGBTQ community and said some bad things about it, so they got banned. The server wasn't as active as it used to be, and some people left because why would you be in a server where the last message was a few weeks ago? At one point even one of the hosts left.

We literally went from more than 10 people to just 4. I tried starting a conversation recently, and it's nice to see everyone is doing good.

Honestly, this is the only (online) friendship i've ever been able to have for this long, so i'm glad i met all these amazing people :)",msokou,self.happy,1585412344

We were actually each other first bf/gf way back in school (we are both 41 now). Over the years we would reconnect but he was across the country and I was a mess. But over a year ago we reconnected, he ended up losing his eyesight and moving back to our hometown and I was divorced, clean and living life on life’s terms. After many months of talking and rediscovering each other we fell in love. This is the most pure, true unconditional love. We took things slow, we learned so much about each other. We didn’t rush into the sexual part of a relationship and by doing that we became so close, so connected, and built an incredible bond and foundation. He may be blind, but he sees the real me, and he is so in tune with my mind, heart, soul and body. It’s absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. I didn’t know this kind of love existed in real life , he is the definition of true love. I am so grateful, so appreciative, and so in love. We have been an official couple for almost 11 months. I just had to share. Stay safe and healthy everyone.

We would appreciate it if you could fill out our quick anonymous [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLRSPbrP7XHarFOZhZhbzobf8qNpYwVh8JGHyLdchcqOXoag/viewform) (approximately 2-3 minutes). PM me if you have any questions or comments.

happy,Today I got invited to a wedding and was told I was the reason they met!,"I’ve been on a bit of a downer recently but this has made me so happy!

I spend a month every year in South Korea. Back in 2019, I planned a trip to the coast for just myself but decided to invite a friend of mine. She asked me if she could make it a big trip and bring 15 people I’d never met before. I said yes because I love meeting new people and I love the international community in SK. I booked 2 earlier extra days just for myself so I was there Thursday- Monday and she booked a 15 person house in the same airbnb right by my room for Sat-Monday. So I went and enjoyed to blissful days sat on the balcony and walking around the coast.

On the saturday they all arrived, 2 different groups of friends my friend had got together to come down. We all had a wonderful time meeting each other, having bbqs, playing games, watching the sunset on the ocean etc

Well today, I got a message on FB from a couple I met there. She was asking me to join their wedding via zoom and told me that they actually met on that trip. They wanted me, someone they’d only met for 2 days, to be at their wedding, because I was the one who had helped them meet! I am just so so so thrilled!!! I thought they already were together on that trip, I had no idea! I’m just super happy and can’t wait to witness their happy day.",hull534,self.happy,1627610648

happy,"We finally said I love you to each other, and it felt so cathartic.","Me and my boyfriend started out as a long distance situation. Started talking last September, he flew to meet me in December and I moved back to the country he's from back in May, that's when we started living together. He always went the extra mile for me, and I tried to do the same for him, but until couple weeks ago we never said ""I love you"" to each other. 

So, couple weeks ago we had a fight. Nothing crazy, not our first one. Once we resolve things we usually cuddle and just give each other affection, helps to let go of all the negative things. Accordingly, after this argument he was holding me. Then he just squeezed me and told me he loved me. I got flustered, so I responded with a squeeze back and an ""aww"", quickly followed by ""I love you too"".

My mind was racing. He said it so casually and out of nowhere, I thought, that first ""I love you"" must not be of equal importance to him as it is to me.
And in the moment I assumed that since we were already calling each other ""my love"", he probably thought he had already confessed his love for me. Nevertheless, I was happy. 

Around a week goes by, we go to visit his dad for a couple days. It was my first time meeting him, so quite a bit of anxiety. Day 1 goes great, lots of good food, great conversation and a lot of booze, so by the end of the night I'm in my feelings. Once we hit the hay, I hug my boyfriend and tell him that I love him. He squeezes me real tight, and for much longer than he usually would. So I ask what's up. He says, well it's the first time you said you loved me. To skip the most of the following conversation, he didn't hear me whisper the ""I love you too"" to him when he told me he loved me. He was very nervous to say it in the first place, and then thought I didn't say it back. According to him, he was happy to wait until I was ready to say it back since I gave a very positive response, but knowing him I'm 99% sure it was torturous for him to think we were not on the same level.

I'm so glad I said it that night. I don't find it easy to tell people I love them, a bit of an avoidant attachment style going on there. Yet it felt so good. It felt good to just say it, and it felt good to be able to tell him that I did say it back that day. It felt good to show him that his feelings were reciprocated and appreciated, and to tell him that I was waiting for a long time to either say it or hear him say it.
Having had a difficult childhood and adolescence, where me displaying vulnerability and emotional pain was greeted by indifference and dismissals, nowadays I still find it challenging to be vulnerable despite having worked out most of my other issues. I have learned to depend on myself, and only myself, on pretty much all levels, and saying ""I love you"" implies that to a certain degree I am willing to depend on and be attached to that person. 
It's not my first relationship, and not my first time saying ""I love you"". But for the first time it doesn't feel like an unhealthy addiction, or a rushed decision. I waited, we waited, and I'm more comfortable in my vulnerability than I have ever been. 

He's more appreciative of my vulnerability than most people I've considered family, friends or lovers. And I'm very appreciative of his. I'm happy.",Lopapeysaa,self.happy,1627606959

happy,I accidentally landed into a great group of friends this year,"Man this is a rant but I'm happy and I just wanna share the story. 

So, making friends as an adult can be pretty hard. Don't get me wrong, I have friends from high school and that I grew up with, but it's also hard to align all our schedules to hang out, or people move, or you just grow distant. My own roommate I barely see because we work opposite schedules! 

But ONE person I kept in touch with, for some reason. We worked at a shitty bar when we were 18, they moved to another state, but we were well acquaintanted, not really even actual friends. And then they moved back like 7 years later and we caught up, acknowledging how odd it is that we stayed in touch. 

And then, out of ANYTHING, they posted on Snapchat about if anyone wanted to play *Among Us.* And I joined in, much to the mild chagrin of THEIR friend group who immediately were like ""Who the FUCK is TheVampirate?"" But for a time this was how I got to know them all, eventually even landing in their actual group chat. 

This goes on for 2 months and, as they also all lived in the same general area, invited me to a house party. I show up late to a series of goofy drunkards who all lined up and asked me ""Guess who everyone is!"" Such a silly game for a first impression. I did okay. 

And it's all been uphill since that. I've gotten to know them all pretty well: we go out every week to the same bar, we have themed parties every month, constant random outings for food or park trips, deep and meaningful late-night convos, SO many photos - it's just, fun! A group of mid-late 20-somethings just living up their lives! It doesn't even matter that I only showed up a few months ago, or that some of them have been friends through high school or even elementary - they've basically adopted me in like I've always been there. It's not always perfect of course but, I mean, it's pretty damn good! 

This group really works. And my heart and soul feel a fullness that I wasn't even aware was missing until now. All through sheer coincidence more than anything. Funny how that works! Serendipity or whatever. 

Yeah, I don't have a good way to end this. I just wanted to share some wholesomeness that's been going on since the beginning of this year. Thanks for reading!",LeVampirate,self.happy,1627602650

Times were so rough for so long that we thought we weren't going to make it after the lease was over but we grew to understand eachother faults and challenges which made us love eachother even more!!

She’s been pressured to do things in the past, and even though we’re just friends, she told me this was the safest and most comfortable she ever felt, and holy fuck that is an amazing thing to hear.

happy,Old heartbreaks can eventually just be nice memories,"I'm sure that this doesn't apply to every situation, but it made me happy to think about today. I thought about my first girlfriend this morning. It was actually because of hearing a song we used to listen to all the time, just driving around our little home town. 

We were both 16 when we met, and we were together for nearly 2 years. It was a classic story, she got into college in a different state, I couldn't afford to go to college yet, we planned to stay together long distance and it lasted about 3 months. 

Breaking up with her ruined both of us at the time of course for a few months, that first person you fall in love with does a number on you. I was pretty miserable for a while. 

For years when I thought about it, it would make me a little sad. Especially if I was single at the time. Then I really never thought about it at all. This was probably the first time I thought about her in as long as I can remember, maybe years (I'm 30 now). This time though I didn't feel sad at all, everything I remembered was a happy memory. The first time we kissed, which was the first time either of us had kissed anyone. Doing absolutely everything together. Sneaking out just to see each other for a few minutes. Climbing an old fire tower in our town, laying out in a field under the stars together. Falling asleep together for the first time. Carrying her around for no reason. Planning all the trips we would never end up going on together. Also, just that overwhelming feeling of wanting to be near someone, and the joy I'd feel when her car would pull up or when she would walk out of her front door to meet me. 

It's all just nice fun stuff, and it doesn't really matter to me anymore that it didn't work out, and I don't really remember the painful part of it ending. I'm just glad it happened, it was probably the best part of my childhood and young adult years and you can't get that back. In my mind she was the most beautiful, smartest, and funniest person I had ever met, and I almost couldn't believe when all those feelings were reciprocated.

happy,I Helped A Random Kid With My Favorite Sport,"Im not sure if this is the place to post this, but sports, specially, hockey has saved my life on more than a few occasions.

A few years ago I was out with some friends playing pond hockey. We all enjoy a good time so a 30 pack of beers was staying cold in a snow bank while we played. It was a great afternoon full of laughs and reminiscing with high school teammates. 

Down the other end of the pond a small kid, maybe 5 years old, steps on the ice with full equipment, no puck, and he’s struggling to skate. We were in the middle of a “water break” and saw the young kid. To this day I have no idea why, but I skated over to him and gave him one of our pucks. I had coached skating for a few years at this point so I stayed for a couple minutes to help him out and then went back to my friends. 

His mom came walking over a little while later to talk to me. In tears she thanked me for taking the time to help her son. Neither of his parents knew anything about hockey, but he really wanted to try it. 

Fast forward to this week. I work a summer camp for hockey skills and when I was walking out of the rink today a woman stopped me.

happy,I Didn’t Know Where To Post This,"Im not sure if this is the place to post this, but sports, specially, hockey has saved my life on more than a few occasions.

A few years ago I was out with some friends playing pond hockey. We all enjoy a good time so a 30 pack of beers was staying cold in a snow bank while we played. It was a great afternoon full of laughs and reminiscing with high school teammates. 

Down the other end of the pond a small kid, maybe 5 years old, steps on the ice with full equipment, no puck, and he’s struggling to skate. We were in the middle of a “water break” and saw the young kid. To this day I have no idea why, but I skated over to him and gave him one of our pucks. I had coached skating for a few years at this point so I stayed for a couple minutes to help him out and then went back to my friends. 

His mom came walking over a little while later to talk to me. In tears she thanked me for taking the time to help her son. Neither of his parents knew anything about hockey, but he really wanted to try it. 

Fast forward to this week. I work a summer camp for hockey skills and when I was walking out of the rink today a woman stopped me. It was the boys mom, he was in the camp, and she told me that I was the reason her kid stuck with hockey.

I was probably in Victoria’s Secret today for over 2hrs, absolutely loving looking for cute clothes for her and Im really excited to show her on Christmas.

happy,"Good things are finally beginning to happen to me after 2 years of unhappy, depressing, torture, and I’m cute apparently.","
Honestly I didn’t think I would make it through my mother’s death. I was fearful of being homeless once I was out of school. I was getting denied from every job I applied to. I only managed to get to law school from poverty because she helped. I was emotionally K.O.ed from my brother abusing my mother and me, stealing my stuff and fleeing before she died. Not like he was helping anyway...yeah yeah I guess I’ll juggle classes and carrying her to her end of life alone. Thanks bro. 

Without her, I’d be homeless post grad (next year).

I skipped classes for weeks, focused only on applying, and eventually landed my dream job. Instead of being on food stamps and homeless, I’ll be litigating making 6 figures. But even after that point I was so behind for the time I took off I felt defeated. I drilled class after class trying to catch up. It really depressed my mental state.

I was really out of it today. Went for a walk. I sit down, this person comes up to me, asks me where the nearest dunks is. I pull it up on my phone. They start walking away, and when they are about 6 feet away they call back and inform me that I’m cute.

That was....the best actual random even I’ve had happen to me in about 13 months. 

Idk maybe I have value beyond this job, and despite these difficult last two year...thing might just now be rounding their way back up :).

Good things are starting to happen again.

happy,"Two years after separation, I have found resilience, and yes, happiness.","Two years ago, my world shattered.  

Our nuclear family, depicted as cheery penguins on the Christmas tree, fell apart.  I’ll spare you the details on exactly what happened, because that’s not the point of my writing this.  Like I said, it was two years ago.

Separation is something that's not easily talked about.  Not on a public scale, at least.  It’s swept under the social media rug, and left on that cutting room floor.  It’s not pretty, it’s not something you can put a filter on to make it better.  You just have to walk through it; and that takes time.  Two years’ worth of time, for me.

There’s firsts that you have to do all over again.  There’s relationships you have to do all over again.  The first series of holidays.  The first time the kids spend the night away from you.  The first school forms you fill out with separate addresses.  All of these moments become building blocks, for the new life you are cobbling.  All of those rebuilt relationships, with friends and family, they are the mortar.

I call all these firsts ‘divorce band-aids’ that you have to rip off, and here’s another one:  The first family pictures.  

Our last family pictures were taken three years ago, and they were beautiful.  They were about the bonds we shared as a family, and I can hold no regrets for that.  

When you look at this picture, I hope you don’t see what’s missing, because nothing is.  Their dad is still very much present, albeit in a different set of family pictures, I suppose.

Instead, look at what is there.  Notice what my incredibly talented friend managed to capture.  My four-year-old’s smirk is telltale of her entire personality.  Look at the way my 6-year-old has to bend down to her mom, because she’s gotten too tall for her own good.  The outfits and accessories that I spent way too much time and energy picking out, all in a single shot.  The beautiful greenery surrounding us.

This picture is still about the bonds we share, but for me, it’s about something else.  It’s about resilience.  

It’s about the journey we have taken to get to this place, and the joy therein.

Life is a series of Chapter Ones, both sad and happy.  When you graduate college, and land that job.  When you lose someone.  When you move to a new city.  When you start a family.  When you battle illness.  Those days and moments that define you.

If my Chapter One was two years ago, this picture is about a woman supported and strong enough to get to the next chapter, and all the chapters thereafter.

happy,"When I was in high school, my parents fell on hard times. I was an athlete and wanted to show off my accomplishments with a letterman jacket, but we were living paycheck-to-paycheck and there was no way they could afford it.","Twelve years later, they offered to gift me that jacket for Christmas. It's been so long-- but you bet I dug up all my patches and drove to our local athletics supply store this morning to order the jacket I always wanted! A part of me feels dumb for being so excited about this. I'm almost 30 and wouldn't say I'm stuck in the past at all, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still proud of my accomplishments from those days. And it really warmed my heart to hear my parents share in my excitement. I think it meant a lot to them then, and still means a lot to them now, feeling that they raised ambitious, hard-working children; these ""championship"" and ""scholar athlete"" patches I had stuffed in a shoebox are like a symbolic testament to that.

I didn't know who I could share this with because of the stigma surrounding grown-ass people reminiscing about the ""good ol' days"" and sporting varsity jackets, so I came here. I'm just having a beautiful day and wanted to share this with someone. I think at the core, it's not about the jacket itself but about knowing that my parents are proud of me and recognize how important sports were for me growing up. What's more, sports provided an escape when my parents went through a years-long rough patch. It wasn't easy to remain focused after my dad had a few stress-induced health scares on top of the financial problems, so not only was getting my varsity letter and accompanying patches an accomplishment just because it was a way to say, ""Yeah, I'm good at sports,"" but it was also a healthy outlet for an angsty teenager who could have spent that energy on destructive activities. I think in the end what my letterman jacket represents is beyond just the ""glory days"" of high school...

Then just a few minutes later, he came right in and hugged and kissed me and told me how happy we was to have spent our first thanksgiving in our new apartment in a whole new city together, hosting for his family. He told me he loved me, and then sat down on the toilet. I smiled to myself and realized this was the true meaning of overall happiness. 


Then i looked down and realized he was applying an Icey-hot pad to his bad knee.

But i’m still happy. :-)

happy,Proposing tomorrow! So excited and nervous!!!!!!😁,"
After 3 years of going out I’m finally going to propose to her tomorrow is our three year anniversary and we are going to the place we had our first date. I bought the ring in late December and been planning this day since then. 

I’ve already asked her dad for his blessing he said yes and I’m just so excited also nervous about proposing tomorrow. 

Just a little story behind us. We knew each other for a year before I asked her out I was pretty down in the dumps and she was already lifting my mood up whenever we hung out I figured I’d shoot my shot and she said yes. Our first date was at a local restaurant we just talked nothing happened that night I got a kiss goodnight and we went back to our places. The next day my mood was amazing for once in a long time did I feel like I was hopping on clouds and extremely happy.

About 6 months in we finally had sex also moved in together about a month later (we were already planning on it) about month 10 I finally told her why I didn’t have or sleep in a bed my childhood wasn’t a especially fun one my uncle molested me for 2 years 10-12 before I finally spoke up about it. When I was 15 I learned he died in prison by a shanking it honestly didn’t help anything I didn’t feel better or nothing. I always had a hard time telling people about that part of my life but she hugged me and I fell asleep in her arms and I woke up the next day and she was still there waiting for me to wake up to make sure I was ok.

1 year anniversary she always wanted to go to some nearby states to see some things like Mount Rushmore so we did that we went to a bunch of different places. I have a pretty good job and I had all my vacation days so I decided to use them all for that we where gone about 3 weeks it was fun.

Nothing really worth mentioning here besides we had a big fight. She stayed at her dads house for a couple of days just because I got a dog (she absolutely loves her now but not at the time) I thought she would love a new dog she had one that died a few years ago and I figured I surprise her with one. About 2 weeks later her and the dog where best friends😂

2 year anniversary she wanted to do something for me this year and she made me my favorite meal (she’s a good cook) then while I was getting the  anniversary present she some how got a bunch of rose petals let to the bathroom and she was in the tub fully nude. Yeah something I wanted to do with her and I just gotta say I loved it🤣

She’s been very caring and understanding of some of my Bullshit like she tolerates me not being able to have sex or sleep in a bed and she sleeps with me on the couch at least 2 times a week she’s gotten me to talk about my past more. I just love her and I’m hoping she says yes. The day I knew I wanted to marry her was when I had a nightmare sweating and all that stuff and she was right there she said she would always be right there for me and honestly I never knew I could smile that big. If she could make be happy every time I see her and say things like that and just makes my heart beat a thousand times a minute even by smiling at me I knew she was the one for me.

If you read all of this thanks I just needed to tell some more people my parents know also my best friend and her best friend along with her dad idk I’m so excited for tomorrow I can’t sleep! I just want to scream like a little girl🤣",ElectronicTea7746,self.happy,1648712840

happy,Corrupt cannabis company leads me to dream job,"My fiancé and I worked at a small, locally owned cannabis facility; he worked there for 3yrs and I 1yr. The owners where our friends and we enjoy the company of everyone at work. We both put in so many hours and knowledge into the company. A few months ago the owners and highest management asked my fiancé to do something VERY illegal. He said no, they did it anyways. He tells HR and all of his management that it is wrong and he won’t be apart of it. They have a meeting the next day and fire him. They fucked him over on everything he build for the company and never finished the paperwork on their end  so he can be properly compensated. I go into work and they log me out of everything, take away my punch card, deactivate my key fob, and change all of the codes for doors. I quit. It was so heart breaking, I was so mad and upset I didn’t even know what to do. We decided it was time to take this shitty situation and turn it around. We moved from central Michigan to norther Michigan. We are enjoying each day as it comes and trying not to dwell on the unfortunate situation. I’ve been applying to so many jobs and hoping I can find one that I truly enjoy. I finally found an organic flower farm in my area. I just had my phone interview and they said I am perfect. I have wanted to be apart of a farm that truly values the land and animals and isn’t in it for greed and mass production. I am so excited to start working for a company who’s goals are sustainability, regenerative farming, organic farming, and who really value their employees. I can’t wait to be apart of something that is so great for the environment. I am so happy for this opportunity and I just want to share with someone.

1. Physical practice - note it down and articulate your emotional and physical reaction.
2. Intellectual practice - focus your 100% control on your input, on that you are doing, because your output is actually out of control, the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is the feeling of lack of control.

happy,my personal life is in bloom and I couldn't be happier,"I've been through the valleys the last few years. Lost my father 2 years ago to Covid. The pandemic, the isolation, being unemployed twice for a short while. Stricken with grief. But then everything started to look up with my therapist's help. Through journalling. Through working through my blockades, my emotional shield, challenging myself everyday to fight my fears.

I've never been happier. I appreciate life more than ever, the small things. I don't seek out the thrills anymore and chase whatever short-term satisfaction there is. I feel grounded and well and happy and can enjoy the fresh spring blossoms. The smell in the woods. I met a wonderful man, who loves me for who I am. Like truly am. I love him every day, every time we meet a little more. It's like the relationships I had before were just the testing ground and I finally feel free to let myself fall. I can't even describe how crazy this is.  I feel even a bit dizzy from all the things happening.

I am in awe of life's discrepancy. There is a war in Ukraine, people still fight with Covid, the world is not the same anymore. But I am also not the same anymore and it's terrifyingly beautiful how the world can host both of these feelings at the same time. Despair and adoration. Love and war crime. Not one after the other, but all simultaneously pulsing through life.  It is insane feeling all of this at once. It feels sort of unreal to feel both of these feelings.

I am so happy that I am even scared I might just die. A sudden death, just 1 week before my 28th birthday. Why am I so scared? I guess my brain can't comprehend what is happening.

THANK you god\*s. Thank you universe. Thank you to all the wonderful people I met until this time of the day. Even the ones who hurt me. You brought me here to this place. And I am enjoying the view from the top. Life will throw its things against me. But I have my team of loved ones who are there for me. I have a partner who is just as excited to start our lives together, to go through the ups and downs of life. I know he wants to move in together, have kids someday, be a family. It already feels like we are a little family. I love him so much and every second spent with him, is a second well spent. I can't wait for our life to begin. I love you.

The death of my father has been gruel. But I learned so much about life and what is really important. I think of him every single day. Not a day goes by without him. And I know he is there, for he speaks in dreams and comes frequently into mind and tells me things. He and my other loved ones whom I never met might just be my cheering team of angels guarding my life. Thank you.",schmeissweg1234567,self.happy,1648581644

Anyway, basically you choose two or three ""courses"" and go to those each week in a way to get better structure, get outside your house and to socialise. Ive always loved creating and different crafts, and after these six months or so ive learned the ins and outs of the two craft rooms, better than most of the staff. Last week was the last crafting group for this period, this week is planning so no patients go there, and then it starts up again next week. After we got done with our last craft meeting thing last week the supervisor asked me if i wanted to help them plan the upcoming new group period!

I was so happy and said yes straight away, and today i had a meeting with the staff that are responsible for the craft group, and it could not have gone better. They loved all my ideas and we decided that I will plan all of the ""themes"" for the group!! Of course they didnt ask me to do everything because, well, im in rehab lmao but i offered. This has given me so much energy, and ill be working on it more over a few weeks, look at what they need to buy and make a list for purchases.

happy,I used to be unhappy until I became happy. We all have a story and this is mine.,"I was miserable before. Hated my job, fighting with family all the time, drinking all day everyday, hated my weight, hated life! 

Now, I got a great job that pays well, it's not in the field I went to school for but it's physically demanding which I love. I can work 6 days in a row and not complain once! Before I would hate working anything more than 2 days in a row. 

I cut back on drinking a lot! Like now I have a couple of beers once a month. I set specific rules I cannot bend and don't want to. 

I'm doing IF and seeing the progress (bmi is normal now). With my job and IF I can feel my strength and will get to my goal weight.

Because I'm working so much I don't have time to fight with family (kind of ignoring the problems but right now it's working).

happy,finally graduated from college and got a perfect score on my final paper,"I've spent so long in and out of community College and working part time or close to full time jobs, with many breaks in between. Finally, I decided to apply for a transfer to the cheapest state university I knew of in state for their excellent Design program. As a traditional and digital artist who's spray years making realistic art, I decided to go for a minor in fine art just to have something to show for my artistic skills. Since last year, I've maintained a 3.8GPA and have a 3.7 overall (I didn't have access to ADHD meds my first year which is why my grades were lower the first year). 
With some help from my parents, I found the perfect apartment (1bdr, 1 bath, open kitchen with tiny washer and dryer in apt). They saw how much I suffered working for 5 years at dead end jobs, living in poor condition in Apts with roommates, and decided to finance my apartment (I'm incredibly fortunate for that) and after age 23 you don't have to include your parents income on your FAFSA application which meant I got generous Pell grants and didn't have to work-- working even part time and going to school is too much for my anxiety-riddled brain unless I'm already good at a subject. 
The degree was challenging but so worth it! I can't tell you how many all-nighters I had to pull to get the grades I wanted, and felt I owed my parents academic success for all they did for me, and seeing how proud they are brings a tear to my eye because I know I disappointed them for many years academically through high school (though I pulled out of it by doing running start- a program where high school students can attend a community College for dual credit). 
I owe my parents a lot, but I'm so happy I've been able to prove myself to them after so many years. I spent 2 weeks taking extensive notes for a book report for a required class. I ended up spending 2 days writing a monster of a paper, and my teacher said I definitely win for submitting the longest paper she'd ever received. There were masters level students in that class as well. I got a perfect score! I was so worried about that final paper and the length but was overjoyed when I got the final grade. 97.36% in that class. Hopefully my other 2 give me similarly high grades, but it doesn't matter because I have my degree now. It took a lot of luck and a lot of effort, but I finally have my bachelor's degree and no one can take that away from me.",InjectAdrenochrome,self.happy,1648281635

happy,i fell off the wagon but i’m finally starting to find my way back onto it.,"i’m proud of myself

for the past 6-7 months i’ve been doing nothing. I lost all that i had left of my motivation to work and i stopped and did absolutely nothing with myself. I went from working 10 hour days, every single day and hated the idea of taking a day off. 

after that i got kicked out of my house and had to move back to my moms up until 2 weeks ago when i got my own apartment. 

i’ve been sort of feuding with my neighbours the past week and it’s been taking a toll of me and made me not want to be in my apartment at all, so i started working again. 

I should add that i’m independent and i’m able to work whenever i feel like it, which explains why i stopped working for such a long period of time. Anyways, yesterday i had enough of the whole neighbours thing and figured i might as well pickup working again. Within the first hour it felt like i never stopped. I suddenly gained all my motivation back. I went back out today and same thing, i loved it. I’m currently laying in bed excited to wake up and get back out and make some money. 

I never thought i’d get back on the road again. My mental state was at such a low point the entire summer and i had no idea where i was going. Things are starting to look up for me now and i couldn’t be happier.",anon_guy123,self.happy,1638168781

I wanted to spam this out somewhere.","I've recently went from a trade I hated doing to a new job I really love doing.  Granted, it's very early on but there's room in this job to grow for promotions, and I am working with several people who I know will become fast friends and they have very similar interests.  To me, that alone is worth more than any promotion, but seeing as I was self-employed for 15 years, I don't really even care about promotions!  

These new folks, they're some of the most kind and fun individuals I've ever met, and for only working a few days with them my little itty bitty Grinch heart has grown 3 sizes -per day- each time I get to hang with them.  I have spent SO LONG dreading the end of every weekend that I'm unsure how to comprehend this new amazing feeling of really looking forward to my job.  

I'm still a complete dunce at work and I have a lot to learn, but my heart is so big and I have CONFIDENCE in this field that before long I'll not only know this stuff but I'll be helping to improve it, it's such a strange feeling.  I want to express this feeling at my job but it's a very diverse group of people and nobody really likes a mushy sap right off the bat, so I just wanted to ""vent"" that out here.  But it's not really a vent, this place felt the more positive place to share it.

I've spent 15 years feeling like nothing I did mattered an ounce and now suddenly I'm part of a team that is great, and I can't wait to work with them more and more and hopefully help build a pillar in their community of my own.

And yesterday I decided to visit my brother and her. The way her face lit up when she came around the corner and saw me is the cutest thing as she ran over yelling in joy and gave me a hug.

We spent all morning playing together and eventually she started rubbing her eyes and was about to take her afternoon nap. I sat on her bed with her in my lap.

""You tired?"", she nods her head. ""Yeah? You want to take a nap?"", she nods her head again. ""You know I luv you?"", she giggles and says ""Yes"". ""You luv me?"", she laughs again and says ""Yes"". I smile and reach forward and kiss her nose then her forehead and she giggles again. Finally she wraps her arms around me and falls onto my shoulder and I play with her hair gently to get her to fall asleep. By this point I'm pretty tired myself and once I see she's finally out, I put her on her pillow and decide I'm too tired to move and fall asleep next to her.

I wake up about an hour later and she's still asleep. But seeing her so blissfully asleep is utter perfection. Yes, I'm just an uncle, but I love her like nothing else. I don't ever plan on having kids of my own, because I see how much parents struggle to raise one kid and see how draining it can be, but it's moments like these that make it seem like it'll maybe be worth it.",LastConsul,self.happy,1617029085

happy,Left the house for the first time in 2 years.,"I went to the shop on my own today. No one asked me or pressured me into it, I wasn’t forced to go with someone else because my cupboards are empty and I haven’t eaten in a while. 

I woke up and went to the shop and for a little walk. All on my own. 
It’s the first time since December 2019 (when I was raped,) that I have left the house through choice alone. And I feel damn good about it. 
I woke up and decided to get ready and go for a walk, I used my last £3 to pop into the shop on the way for milk and butter and give myself some purpose for being out and walking. 

I’m happy I did. I smiled at 2 people and passed another 5, a local worker said good morning and I said it back. I didn’t burst into tears and fall to the floor in a fit of anxiety. 

I know this is a very small/trivial thing but I have been terrified of leaving the house for fear of bumping into my rapist or his friends.
I haven’t left the house without my mother or partner for over a year, I haven’t gone into the village I am from and I even quit my job because of my fear of people. It’s become really severe, even getting post in my own apartment hallway triggers massive panic attacks, and I worry about even standing outside my front door in case he appears or something happens but I finally did it ! 
I can’t even explain how good I felt just being in control and taking a little bit of normalcy back for myself after so long. It’s like feeling you’re going to die every time you have to step foot past your door. And I overcame it today. 


I know this is not important or impressive but it personally felt really good, I don’t have anyone to tell so I thought a load of strangers would be good. I went from being the most outgoing person who would speak to anyone and was fearless to a complete hermit.
I hope today is a step in the right direction.",dribblekiwiiiiii,self.happy,1616968840

happy,I have the power of my own life in my own hands and no one can hurt me except my own self," So yea, there was a time when I used to make myself very ""sexually available"" to people(men) cause I thought that the way I can get love from them. With time it got worse and people started to take my vagina for granted and I was sexually abused quite a times. I still didn't stop being this person till I realised that I got one life and am I really respecting myself, my body and my sexuality. I gradually got into meditation and self and it all started from there. I started to love myself so much that I did not need any outside person to love me or complete me. But after so many years of making myself sexually available, I did not want to get indulged in any sexual activity with anyone, but then I again realized that I had the power of my own life in my own hands and no one can hurt me except my own self. So gradually I discovered tantra, then neo tantra. I understood how sex is not just pleasure but energy and I began to worship my body and indulge in sexuality but this time in a more respectful, conscious, and spiritual manner.

happy,A Love Letter for the Person Who Makes My Life Great; Kind of Happy,"Wow. We got this far. From being a dumb little kids chatting online about stupid drama to teenagers talking about life and reality drama. There is one reality I hate to have to accept. That is that I'm in love with you. You have a girlfriend, and I'm fine with that. I want you to be happy, I would never attempt to sabatoge your relationship. Hell, I would hate that. There's a higher chance of me getting hit by a train than doing that.. But however, I can't deny these hidden feelings inside of me that I depise. I grow so happy whenever I see a message from you, my cheeks turn red and my heart bursts with joy whenever we converse. 

You're one of the only people that can make me happy just by sending me a message. That's why I so frequently message you.. Of course, I'd never tell you this to your face, nope. It's pretty rare for me to hold on a crush for this long, but I can say that I am certain that I've fallen in love. Ugh, it's both a blissful feeling and a terrible one. Hopefully you'll never see this, you probably never will. 

This is a dumb little teenager crush, but I can't deny how hard I've fallen. It's embarrassing to write even though you'll never find this. I feel as if the cupid has struck me with 3 arrows instead of one (both like hellfire on your back but bliss). I know you think this little crush is adorable but I think it's also living hell. A part of my mind does want to be with you, romantically. But I do understand that will probably never become a reality, and I'm also fine with that. I don't even know what I'm saying at this point, I'm just saying that you, quite literally, drive me nuts but I'm also a rational person myself (credit to mom).

And I will say this, as much as I paint myself as the respectful non-jealous crush person, I will say. I do get jealous pretty frequently. As much as I will deny it, I am a very jealous and envious person. So, you could put the puzzle pieces together with that. 

Hugh, I don't have a lot more to say, other than. Yes, I've fallen in love with you. I know I act all embarrassed and shy whenever you bring up the crush, but now that you probably won't find this, I'm much more open now. Yes, I've fallen in love. Deep. Yes, I blush every-time you speak to me. Yes, I do think about you pretty frequently. Have I had this crush ever since the beginning of 2019? Yes. Yes, I do get insanely jealous. Will I admit it? No. 

I love you..both romantically and platonically :)

happy,I had 50 dollars in my account a few hours ago.,"In February I was in a car accident that left my unable to work up until last month. I had some savings but had used most of it to buy a house back in September of 2019. The 5ish months I was out of work ate through my savings and so I prioritized bills that HAD to be paid and those that could wait. 

Got paid on Friday everything else went to bills. Hence the $50 I had left in my account this morning. Started making dinner and habitually took a look at my checkings account. I thought for some reason my payments got kicked back. I couldn’t find anything in the statement, so I put my phone down and ignored it. Checked again later. It was a direct deposit for two weeks of unemployment I had applied for 2 months ago! 

I had truly given up hope on receiving anything because everyone else I know got there’s in a week or two for longer periods of time, and none had to go through and entire interview process and give tax documents. That extra 2400 placed me from 2-3 weeks out from being back to square one, to this Friday I’ll be back to where I was before the car accident!

It’s a Monday, and often (like, I assume, a lot of you) I don’t look forward to Mondays. It’s easy to get depressed about another week of work that you don’t enjoy. But I forced myself this morning to focus on the blessings of a Monday morning. 

* I have a job, that provides me with income. That’s more than many people can say.      
* Last week was pretty shitty for me. On one hand, that means I don’t look forward to going back in, but on the other, it’s a fresh start. This week will be what I make it. 
* I am sitting at my desk with a mug of hot coffee, answering emails. As much as I don’t *enjoy* my job, I can’t really complain. That’s pretty cushy. 
* I drove here this morning in a car that I own. There was snow covering the hills around me, and the early morning winter sun looked absolutely beautiful. It was a pleasant drive. 

It’s easy for me to forget about all the blessings I have at work. This was a good thing for me to reflect on today, and hopefully it can inspire some of you to choose to focus on the positives of every day. ",DM_ME_UR_BOOBS_G1RLS,self.happy,1548690679

I won't go into details, but my relationship with my kids mother has been very dark and complicated.  I worked hard to try to involve them in my life and let them know I have always cared for them; it has paid off.


Imagine as a parent that you can yell and scream at your adult child because you disagree in any argument; but when you say ""I love you"" and they say the same thing.

We listen to each other, we respect each other; there is nothing better than that.

happy,I've finally had the last trace of a troubled history erased,"I haven't told many people, but I really want to talk about it because it's been such a monumental part of my life.

&amp;nbsp;

So I got in trouble for selling drugs ~5 years ago. 

TL;DR at the bottom. 

I had to do what I had to do to get the charges dropped for my future prospects. I felt like shit throughout the whole thing. But I vowed never to return to that life and I had to keep that promise to myself. I got a shitty part time job (After searching for a long time) and had to live at my dads house because I literally only had 20 hours a month worth of work to do and no one else would hire me. I worked on my knees at 5am til when we were done doing merchandising. But a huge shoutout to the company that hired me, because eventually months later, I was able to re-return to a summer job that I had done before but was unfortunately fired from. (I was a very shit worker) I worked for them because my childhood friend vouched for me once again, and I'm proud to say that I was able to finish out the season and redeem myself with them. 

From there I was able to get a job working with at-risk youth. I saw the ad, and I swear I could hear it calling my name. I have never had so much fun, and a feeling of purpose than I have had during that time! I eventually moved to a different city to get away from my past, because at that point the whole city seemed to hate me. I was on the front page news 2 days in a row until someone got charged for tying their wife/gf up and setting the house on fire. Everyone at the jail knew who I was before I even got there.

In this new city with my wife (Oh yeah, forgot to mention my fiance/wife was with me every step of the way and has never wavered, she's a keeper!) I was able to help the same company start a new office, and I've basically been here ever since. 

Well, I thought everything was behind me, and basically everything is behind me. But I did a quick google search on my name to see that a local news company had an article up about me from the incident. I have never held contempt for any news articles about me, because it was warranted. But I really want to try to become a real estate agent / insurance salesman, and appearance is everything in those fields. So I emailed the news company and requested that they take out my name in the article, as it's the last remaining trace of a troubled past that I have. I mean, you can literally see an article of the elementary kids, and there's a picture of me and a childhood friend holding up our brass instruments. RIGHT NEXT  to the whole ""drug arrest"" stuff. 

The editor said it's very unusual to ever edit stories after they've been written, but she decided to help me anyways.

I fucking cried, a lot. I still can't really believe it. Eventually when google updates after it recrawls / reindexes, I will literally never come up anymore and you will only be able to find the stupid goofy things I've done or my social media... 

And It's never felt so freeing.. Thank you for allowing me to ramble about this, I really needed it.

---------------------------------

TL;DR: Editor of my last remaining news story about my troubled past has agreed to remove my name from the story, because she felt empathy for my future endeavors after I had emailed her. She said it was highly unusual, so I don't take what she did lightly.

happy,"I have been playing a game called Beat Saber all year- This is a song I have been trying to beat since the start. Even though it is just mo-capped, the moment I realise I actually did it is captured perfectly.","I know this may be a little off kilter- but- I am really happy about this. One of the best things I got last year thanks to my new job was my VR. I love it- I really do- and I always remembered watching all these really cool videos of other people playing what I considered to be impossible songs. Well, one by one each of these ""impossible"" feats started to fall- but throughout the month there was one I just couldn't nail.

I tried this song every so often for months- the closest I got was the last minute but I always failed... every damn time. So today when I was recording random songs to see if I had installed a mod correctly I tried to play Through the Fire and the Flames on Expert again- just for the hell of it. I had beaten Hard a long time ago but had sort of assumed expert was out of my reach. To beat it. I just- it felt so good. 

I am not trying to advertise anything here- so all I am linking to is the very end. This is the part you can see me starting to get antsy. I expect to lose at any moment but it isn't happening- then- when it finishes you just can see that moment of brief pause before I drop my sabers and scream out loud with pride and joy. 

https://youtu.be/Qf3qtu3X1vw?t=392

I know it is silly, and I know it isn't really a typical post. I know there are better than me, but I just. I feel like nothing can stand in my way now. Bonus is- this happy feeling never has to stop. I have been showing off my VR to more and more people and all bar about one has been blown away- so now not only can I see my own happiness but I can see the happiness in all their eyes and it makes me so damn happy.

happy,Finding out someone has a crush on you is a really happy thing!,"So I would consider myself an average looking person, nothing special. I never really have people hit on me or compliment me much, so when I do receive any small kind of compliment, it really means a lot to me. But a few days ago, I found out that a girl who I see every once in a while (but have honestly never really talked to) apparently has had a huge crush on me for a while, and has been trying to come up with ways to ask me out. I haven't seen her at all since I heard this, but it just seems crazy to me that somebody out there could actually have a crush on me and want to ask me out. Like, I guess I must be doing something right, but I sure couldn't tell you what it is. 

I would've never guessed in a million years that this girl would actually have a crush on me. I think she's pretty cute, so next time I see her, I am definitely going to be paying more attention to her and hopefully we can set up a first date and see how things go. 

I've been super stoked though ever since I heard this, and, honestly, my whole world has seemed a little brighter this week. So to all you people out there who have never had someone have a crush on you before, I would like to say just keep doing you, love yourself, and be kind to those around you. You never know who's watching you, and you never know, one of them might end up having a crush on you! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Lost my grandma and grandpa, divorcing my husband, sold the home that I loved, and the list goes on.

This week has been really good though, and I'm hoping the rest of the year continues this way! I have an absolutely fantastic boyfriend. He is so incredibly nice to me. He has proven that there are great men out there. He is super supportive but also helps keep me in check mentally and physically (going to the gym, and not being too hard on myself for being sad and depressed occasionally).

Also, I ran my first half marathon this past weekend! A huge accomplishment for me! My ex was always super negative about my goals. He kicked me down over and over, to the point I didn't even want to sign up for the marathon. Once I kicked him out of my life, I immediately signed up!

By the end of the year, I will also have my Masters in Business Administration and hopefully a new home to call my own. I'm just excited and happy and wanted to tell the world of reddit. :)

Also, I wanted to brag about having a man in my life that treats me as an equal and with a huge amount of respect. It is so refreshing to be cherished and appreciated just for being me.",ktlou0915,self.happy,1569614828

This time too,I didn't make it to the final of the college football tournament (Round Robin + Final) due to a tiebreaker of 1 goal difference with top 3 (out of 5) teams tied for the first and second spot (each at 9 points in 4 matches) even after beating the finalist 3-2 coming from 2-1 down at half time.

I got him a satirical bucketlist book which was really expensive but honestly so worth it. He' sreally funny too and I knew he'd love it. A see-through saving box. With a world map on the back and the words ""and now the adventure begins"", because he and his wife like to travel.

I also got him a little wooden thingy for his keychain, which said I wish you all the luck! And last but not least a gold desk name plate which said ""the best colleague of the world"". And put it in a marriage gift bag.

I was planning on a bowlingball mug but it broke when it arrived at my house in delivery, and getting another one was nearly impossibke so I just left it. I was salty tho bc he really likes pokemon too and if I knew the bowling ball one would break I'd have gotten the pickachu one.

happy,"After 10 years of being crushed in court and having to be the better person, I got nearly full custody of my son!","My son has always been attached to me over others.  As a baby, he'd crawl around to find me or, if I was holding him and his mother reached for him, he'd push her away and bury his face into my chest.

The divorce with my ex-wife was incredibly painful.  I know there are two sides to every story and emotions run high during divorces - especially with children - but I was crushed at every turn without thought for what was best for my son.  Or for me.  I was financially drained and then wrung out some more.  I lived in fear of bills in the mail and I have lasting psychological damage when it comes to finances because of it.

I'm thankful for the time I was able to get with my son because it could've been far worse.  I was given roughly five days every other week that was (years later) increased to six days after an error on her part.

I think the hardest part was being told to be the better person throughout all of it.  Especially because she wasn't.  She had no problems bending the law as far as she could or talking trash about me to him.  And, through it all, people told me to be the better person.  So, I did my best.  Never speaking ill of her to him and doing what I could with the time I had.  Even when she switched school districts, mangling my commute and lessening the time I had, I just kept going.  

As the years went on and he grew up, he began to notice the differences between me and my ex.  She would rarely spend time with him or pay attention to him.  He was always secondary to her and her goals.  I know she loves him in her way but she never put him first.  There were car rides where he would get emotional and cry because her emotional absence or abuse hurt him.

And that continued through the years.  I fought in court (uselessly) when I could but continued to just enjoy my time with him when I had him.

He's such a great kid and we always have that ease where we can talk about anything.  I save up hilarious or interesting reddit posts to share with him, we game together (and he destroys me in FPS games), we go hiking and camping and just enjoy life.  I was there every time he needed me.

A little less than a year ago, his mother started a job (her first, basically, after trying again and again to start her own businesses).  

Six months ago, she switched her work schedule to evenings.  I only learned about it when my son texted me from school to ask to pick him up on one of her days.  It took a while before his mother answered my calls or texts to where she told me I had to take him every weekday.  No warning or care for my schedule or how the change would impact him.  But that's typical.

I took him.  Despite the extra driving and money (still paying her child support despite now having him 90% of the time) for food and everything else, I took him and we had a blast with the extra time.

I told my ex in February that she needed to either make the schedule permanent or switch back to a daytime schedule and actually be there for him (I learned through our son that she was almost always dropping him off at her ex-boyfriend's house on the two weekends a month she still had him) as his mother.  She said no and refused official mediation from the court parenting plan.

So, I filed for a modification, requesting the change to be permanent.

***And I got it.***  I asked the court to make the schedule permanent, listing all the things I've done and why it should be changed.

She never responded to the motion and didn't show up for court.  The judge noted everything, filled out papers and gave me custody.  I can't quite describe how amazing that day was, earlier this week.  After ten years of struggling with it all.  After her getting her way despite evidence of being a terrible mother.  And now I had him.

I'd given him some heads-up way earlier on what I was doing.  As carefully as I could explain without painting her in a bad light, I let him know I was working to try to keep the schedule as it was.  Sadly, he was fine with it.  She's damaged her relationship so far with him that he's perfectly happy with the extended schedule.

I reaffirmed that the day I picked him up after the court's decision.  For the remainder of this year, he stays at his mother's house after school until I can pick him up.  She lashed out at me to him, telling him terrible things to paint me in a bad light.  But, after he told me about it in the car ride home, he said ""It just all sounds like lies.""

I stayed the course over those ten years, being the better person and raising him to be an empathetic kid.  I taught him the best I could and it shows so well in how he deals with the world around him.

happy,Life is very complicated sometimes we need a break to go back and take some simple steps so that we can have a good life.,"As there is a saying that “Life is not bed of roses” we all have some sort of obstacle in life. Do not panic at all - if you fight you will be strong and know how to live life.

Laugh a loud whenever possible and enjoy your present moment.

Spread love as much as possible.

Giving and sharing will bring positivity in life.

Bring smile in the face of stranger.

Sometimes if you are exhausted and feel hopeless think accomplishments you have gained so far and your contributions which made world a better place to live.

Entertain yourself, hang out with friends, watch movie more importantly follow your passion.

Eat in moderation, and sleep enough.

Walk daily at least 30 mins will help relax and regenerate your energy.

Learn, educate yourself, and others around you be hungry for new things.

Make a bucket list and plan for a vacation.

Set goal of what you will be 5 years from now and check every year if you are going towards there.

Spend only how much you need and create a habit of saving rest.

In the end always think that if there is no problem in life what will motivate you to go ahead and how you will live your whole life so, everything has its own reason.

As cats age their purr changes, from the loud shameless buzzing of kittens to the low mature rumble cats segue into as they age. Sif, it appears, never got that memo and still purrs with the joyous abandon of a kitten, and can keep the purring going for hours at a time.

Freya on the other hand has the teeniest tiniest little purr, barely audible unless the room is very quiet. Or so I thought. See, it took a long time for my cats to get over their trust issues after I adopted them. Sif was over it first and got around to bossing me about fairly quickly but Freya always hung back.

I could see that she wanted to be near me, any time I sat down she would park herself close by (close, but never touching). When Sif came to bully me for cuddles in bed Freya would crawl on to my legs (as long as the duvet was between us). Gradually she established that there were certain places where I would be motionless for some time (computer chair, in bed) and she slowly started to get closer and allow me to pet her.

The first time I heard that little raspy purr I almost cried I was just so happy that she was happy. Then one day something amazing happened, Freya got a happy.

I have no idea what it was but something about today's belly rubbings just made her the happiest little cat and her purrs started to get louder. And Louder! Then I noticed that there was an odd little rattle at the end of her purr and I started to panic, thinking she'd hurt her throat until I looked closer at her happy little face and saw that her chubby little cheeks were actually rattling with the force of her purrs.

happy,Was panicking and thought I might've failed out of school. Did better than I expected and didn't fail out :D,"Had a really rough year academically. Battled anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, disordered eating, my dog died, sibling was suicidal, relative got cancer, plus constant Imposter Syndrome. Didn't do well last semester for the same reasons, so I was barely hanging on academically. 

Really tried hard this semester, but still had a hard time mentally. Was burned out and couldn't wait to be done. Finals came around, and I wasn't feeling good about it. Finished exams and legit thought I failed a couple. I put off checking grades because I thought I failed out and my dream was dead. Reaaally didn't want to have to tell my parents I failed out of school. I would've felt so bad.

I finally ripped the bandaid off and checked my grades: I DIDN'T FAIL ANY CLASSES THANK GOD. I genuinely try to do as well as possible and I study hard, but my personal issues make it hard for me to do well. And after how horribly I did last semester (literally barely avoided probation), I was panicked cuz my GPA needed a good semester just to stay in school. Gotta be honest, I was so stressed that I was just praying I didn't fail any classes. AND I DIDN'T FAIL ANYTHING! My GPA's still not great cuz of last semester, but even though I did meh this semester, I brought my GPA up a bit. Most importantly, I DIDN'T FAIL OUT OF SCHOOL! I know not failing out of school seems like a very low bar for most people, but tbh I had such a bad last semester that it was a real concern for me. I'm not even on academic probation. My GPA's not great rn, but I still have time to bring it up. I'm just so glad my dream isn't dead and I get to come back next semester :'D",dcfb2360,self.happy,1559179830

I love getting post when someone has gone to a little bit of extra effort (and when it’s not a bill!!). I’ve made some postcards which have patterns to colour in, puzzles, or just a funny drawing, however I was wondering if there was anywhere that sells ‘activity postcards’ at a reasonable price should I not have time to make some in the future. Or if anyone has any ideas for what could go on these postcards for when I do have time!! TIA",misso14,self.happy,1559175433

happy,"after a long and difficult depressive episode, I can finally say that I'm happy again :)","hi everyone! I haven't posted as often as I used to on reddit, but I really did want to share how amazing I've been feeling lately :)

I still can't believe how great I've been doing now compared to the start of this year. I went through so much, so *so* much. I had 5-6 month depressive episode (starting in December '18) and it has finally subsided. This was my worst episode yet; I went into isolation and suicide attempts and so many pages of potential last letters. I went through losing people one after another because of how much hurt I was getting from them. it was a tough time and to top it off, my psychiatrist kept switching my meds so it was just months of hell. emotional and physical abuse, gaslighting, unmentionable things. and they're gone now, thank god.

but looking back at that now? I'm glad that I constantly made the decision to stay. I can say I'm at the happiest and proudest moment as of now. I'm off medications that were really not working for my mental health, my relationship with my family is at an all-time high, I've made such amazing progress personally and professionally, I've been accepted and transferring to one of my top university choices in the fall, dean's list. two years in a row, ending sophomore year with a 3.7cum gpa and. one year of RA experience...life is just so good!

and when I really thought I wouldn't be able to believe in love again, I found a reason :) he's my dream guy, a gentle 6'3 Italian giant with the sweetest heart and even sweeter parents! we've been talking for quite some time, but yesterday I took my chances and made it official, and I'm so happy! and yesterday I met his parents too for a picnic LOL, and they were absolutely amazing, especially his pup! my last relationship, I didn't feel as though I could be my genuine self, especially with the parents. it was like I had to pretend to be someone just to impress them, but I didn't feel that way at all yesterday. I was welcomed with open and loving arms, and I received so many sweet gifts from his mother and I really did want to cry!! just so sweet. you don't really meet people like that often, people with hearts of gold even after going through so much. I absolutely love him!

but I'm so happy that apart from my relationship, I feel more confident as an individual. I've gained confidence in myself and my skills, and learned to really trust my intuition. I learned to fall in love with music and my favorite artists all over again. and it's a lovely feeling.

is it hard to let go of the past, or really just to learn from it? yeah, of course! and it's even more difficult with how I am as a person-- still worrying and caring for people who I don't talk to anymore/had to cut off. I hope they're doing well, and I don't see the need to carry any animosity anymore. it just doesn't help anyone, and I just wish everyone the best in life and to have that opportunity to just live life with happiness and love.

I put a recent selfie up with one of my favorite songs! there is so much to smile about, and I'm so excited to continue the year with this positive mindset. wishing everyone the best in life, and lots of love to receive and share!!

happy,Diagnosed at age 15 with an eating disorder. No one expected me to make it this far. But here I am. I am so happy that I chose recovery. Life is worth it. I am worth it.,"
I’m feeling sentimental. So, long story short- I am in recovery from an eating disorder. Both bulimia and anorexia have taken turns swallowing me whole. When I was 15 I was diagnosed and that’s when shit really hit the fan. As I started getting help and my community found out (I’m from a small town) people started sharing their war stories they had heard about the hell that is eating disorders. My parents were told over and over that I probably wouldn’t graduate high school. I would never go to college. I would never have a “normal” life. I didn’t go to my junior or senior year of high school. But I finished online while away at treatment centers. I walked with my graduating class on time. I enrolled in college (without even visiting.) I made it one semester before I went back to treatment. The cycle continues on and on. 7 treatment centers and a few years later... I was “supposed”  to graduate college this month. As I watched Instagram and Facebook flood with pictures that I should have been a part of, I felt like a failure. I was on track to graduate but in October I was being bullied so bad that I withdrew from college. I decided I’d rather graduate a year late with self love in hand and a diploma in the other, than on time with my plane ticket booked back to rehab.

Things didn’t go as planned. But even though it felt like my world was ending countless times in the last seven years, it didn’t. Here I am. It’s not fair to compare my worth to the timeline in which others reach milestones. It’s not a competition. I am proud of my peers and I am proud of myself. Our lives aren’t meant to look like cookie cutter replicas. Both are good.

I never thought I’d live to be the whopping 22 year old I am today. But I am. With every beat of my heart I am beating the odds. And while I carry sadness that things didn’t happen in the order I had hoped, I choose to celebrate. I celebrate the fact that because I chose recovery, I can graduate a year late. Because I have another year of life. And many to come after that. I celebrate because for the first time in my life, I am dreaming of my life. A life I get to live, because I didn’t give up.

Choosing life and recovery is hard. But man am I glad I stuck around to make this choice.

happy,I'm so happy. I got promoted by my BJJ coach out of the blue and got an extra suprise from my boyfriend in the same night.,"So, this isn't my normal kind of post but I really wanted to share this.

So my amazing BF got me started with BJJ (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) shortly after we first got together.
My boyfriend is working away a huge amount at the moment so I hardly get to see him. It will be better soon but I do miss him loads.
In his absence I've been attending one to three classes a week pretty consistently. 
Usually the women's class and then one or two of the normal classes or open mats.
Tonight I knew our woman's class was being taken by the head coach which isn't common.

Anyway, normally after technique we would do some sparring, however instead he called me and another girl up for promotion and I got my blue belt. Totally shocked and amazed by this.

To celebrate getting a belt our club does an 'iron man' type thing where you have to spar with everyone one after another from lowest to highest belt. 

Anyway the women's class is quite small so I had spar with each person for 2 mins back to back.
There were 4 white belts,  two blues,  1 brown,  then one of the male assistant coaches who is a brown belt, then the head coach himself.

I stood up, totally wiped out, exhausted, and as I go to shake the coaches hand I'm suddenly swept from behind.
My BF was there in full outfit. I just melted.
Not only was it a huge thing for him to be there for my promotion.  It means rather than driving 2hrs to his next job tonight/in the morning, he chose to drive 6.5hrs in the wrong direction to come and see my promotion. 
We spent some time together this evening after training but only a couple of hours.
He's just set off now to spent all night driving about 8.5hrs ish to be onsite in the morning on time.

happy,I've had some truly incredible sports related birthdays,"Back on May 26th, 2002 the Sacramento Kings were playing the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. It was my 9th birthday, and I was a big Lakers fan. Seeing Robert Horry hit a game winning 3 with no time left was a moment I will never forget.

On May 26th, 2009, at the age of 16, my favorite hockey team the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Carolina Hurricanes in 4 games to go back to the Stanley Cup Finals. I will never forget that game either. 

Then again, in 2017 on May 25th, this time on the eve of my birthday just 12 minutes before my birthday, Chris Kunitz (one of my all-time favorite players) scored the game winning goal in double overtime to send the Penguins to their second straight Stanley Cup Finals. 

I will never forget these 3 games. I have had some of the greatest birthdays anyone could ever ask for. This year there were no games on my birthday. But I will never forget those 3 games that were on, or leading into, my birthday. Does anyone else have some amazing sports related birthdays?",Pikesburgh27,self.happy,1558984767

After so many immigration issues, they finally get into the country. Two months has passed and kiddo was struggling. New country, new culture and a new language. Finally being put to work the day shift, I got her some rollerblades, rollerskates, longboard and a skateboard. I took a skate park trying to teach her how to longboard. Eventually I asked someone her age (14) for advice since I dont know either, and started holding her up and passed her to him to assist. Once a crowd of kids started forming I went back to the truck to ""put away"" some stuff and waited a few hours. As it was time for us to leave, I fetched her and asked if she made any friend.

happy,"my girlfriend, who has been dealing with bedbugs for the last 2 months, has officially been CLEARED!","so here's the deal.

thing 1: we are in a long distance relationship, so i live her experiences thru vicarious means, online, phone, etc. so i'm not experiencing firsthand what things she's been having to go thru.

thing 2: she has (we both have) a disability. there are limitations to what she can accomplish, even concerning menial tasks etc. she lives in an apartment building who is, let's say, definitely not up to code. they don't keep up their building so as to prevent certain outbreaks, like bedbugs, etc. and the saddest part is, this place is a historical building. nothing short of ELVIS has stayed there (because it used to be a hotel). well, it's now disability housing, and because of that (sad, but very true) they basically have let it go to shit. simply put, disability concerns are NOT a concern to anyone else BUT the disabled. which means that, when the building says they expect something done, they expect it to be done, regardless of anything that may pose a challenge: they just don't care. so she's had to deal with this for MONTHS, because she would do all she could, not being able to get EVERY detail perfect to their standards, PLUS them not keeping up their end of the deal... it made for a hell of a go. it got so bad, it was interfering with her mental health to a fairly serious degree. all manner of concern and fear would go through her mind, and she would be in a panic for the whole day. she would tell me the only thing that would get her through those times would be me patiently listening to her, talking her off the ledge so to speak, whenever appropriate, just being there.

&amp;#x200B;

so anyway, she just called me a few minutes ago to tell me the news. and when she tells me something happy, she'll call me and immediately respond with, ""babe! babe! babe! babe! babe!"" (and each time there will be a response to her call from me, which will either be ""yeah!"" or ""babe!"".... so we're gross, too.) and then she was like ""they cleared me!"" and i didn't even have to think for a second about what she meant when she said it, and... here's the thing, i'm an empath, so if you tell me some especially relieving news, I'M GOING TO FEEL IT THE EXACT SAME WAY.

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO this means that our plan for her to make the trip to see me in January is no longer in jeopardy! even though i told her, if she were to transfer bedbugs to my place, we (i live with my dad) would correct it, since we have better resources and safeguards (namely, we don't live in an apartment building... plus, my dad being the more direct resource, since he's able bodied, and not afraid to throw money where money needs thrown).

happy,Witnessed someone’s humanity in an elevator after therapy. Truly life changing.,"Cry in elevator 

November 25, 2019 2:15pm

I just had such an odd but refreshingly beautiful *truly* human experience. 

I was leaving a particularly difficult therapy session where I cried most of the way through. As I was leaving my therapists office I booked it to the elevator because my puffy red eyes and the potential that I was going to burst into tears and shatter into pieces was happening and I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could so if I broke down it wouldn’t be in the lobby and I could just get outside. 

I clicked the button to go from the 5th floor to the lobby while I stood alone in the elevator. Then the elevator stopped one floor below me- a different floor of the therapy center I was at. 

A young 20 something female presenting human came into the elevator and stood slightly in front of me. I heard sniffling and realized she was silently, bravely trying to contain her crying. Their faux fur coat hood obstructed my view of their face but I could hear the restraint. As we stood there descending in the elevator I just thought to myself very mindfully “here are two people who are hurting in the same space, each going through something different but feeling pain and yet we stay silent.” 

For a moment I had the urge to reach out and hug her. I felt the same way as I walked half a block down the busy New York street behind her, with her cries still being stifled the whole time but audibly getting a bit louder. 

I chose not to touch her because some people have trauma and would be startled if you touch them so I didn’t. But that’s the only reason I didn’t do anything. To respect that she might be startled by my intentioned loving and empathetic touch. 

But to have two humans together in a box descend 3 floors and not acknowledge each other was powerful. I don’t know if she noticed me, if she knew it was okay to cry in front of me because internally I was still crying. 

The silence of two peoples hurt was ear shattering. Painful. Sad. But the most visceral human experience I’ve ever had. 

My eyes are open, I saw another persons humanity and we were linked in one way or another. We stood in silent solidarity. Resilient, we stood in tandem in our hurt. 

I hope they are okay. I hope they have someone that can hug them in the way that they need. In the way I need right now. But instead I sit here on my hour ride home on the train now filled with a curiosity, heaviness, sadness and yet peace. I hope they know they were seen and not feel invisible.",NoCreativeInput,self.happy,1574739086

No, not strange. Because we live in a world of duplication; there are up and down, inside and out, hot and cold …

happy,I had the best couple days in years and can't stop grinning from ear to ear,"Since August I was applying for jobs, because I have to give up my self-employment and side-job due to lack of income and dept. After dozens of rejections, today I finally got that one phone call I was eagerly awaiting since my trial-day last week. I got the job, and that job is amazing. Everything just clicked the moment I met my future bosses for the first interview.

I startled my boyfriend because I just started screaming and jumping all over his place, I couldn't contain my happiness. He hugged me really tight and told me how proud he was of me. I felt so overwhelmed I almost started to cry. He's so good to me ever since we had our first date and I love this man with everything I have. Last night I woke up because I felt his arm over my body. He was hugging me in his sleep, and when I put my hand on his arm, he made a happy little noise and nodded, as if he had to make sure I was still there next to him. When I left his place tonight, he couldn't stop hugging me until I almost missed my bus, and he again told me how proud he was of me.

Everything just feels so right at the moment. I can't stop smiling.",queenofskys,self.happy,1574715374

I usually head near her town for a work out with the Marines but still out of my way once a week for so never went there and last time I heard she had a boyfriend so wasn't going to go that route. So when she wanted to meet up I canceled my plans on Thursday and we made plans to go to a coffee shop in her town. The coffee shop was christmas decorated and was breathtaking, it had a vintage look with old tables and chairs that was wood and everything had a theme to it as well. I waited for her, really nervous, and I saw her walk in, beautiful as a sunset in the pasture on a warm night and we held each other pretty much with our hug and did not really ever let go. We walked up to order ""coffee"", we got toasted marshmallow hot chocolate instead, and it tasted like fall. We talked and I would always get lost in her beautiful blue eyes and we just laughed and we walked around outside for a bit and then the most magical moment happened, we walked to the park across the street and it was cold so she came close and we leaned in and kissed. It was the best moment of my life to date and I am now dating her. I just wanted to talk about the moment to people and hopefully not annoy them so sorry if you hate this stuff but just wanted to talk about it.",frickfrackrslash,self.happy,1574702606

happy,It's been a stressful 2 weeks. My family's only car was hesitating during acceleration. Finally fixed it now am feeling ecstatic and accomplished.,"It took me one day over two weeks. I don't have a second vehicle. I didn't get to work on it every day. Some days I was waiting for parts.  Some days I didn't have a ride to get parts.    It was a rough two weeks.  Thankfully my mother loaned me her car approximately half the days but not until about 4 pm because she doesn't drive in the dark.   It was a lot of strain on her and on my wife kids and myself.   I so appreciate her loaning me her car she suffers from anxiety and depression and it stresses her out to be without her car even if she wouldn't drive it anyway in the dark.   I live about 25 mins away so each time she loaned it is drive her home and then the next morning go pick her up and she'd drop me off. 

   I had a little bit of difficulty diagnosing the issue.  But everything I replaced was in need of replacement soon anyway.   The car has 253000 miles on it.  I basically did a major tune up.  Replaced the fuel filter and air filter, the mass air flow sensor, an oxygen sensor, spark plugs and wires and ignition coil, I cleaned the IAC and throttle body.   My wife helped and my brother in law who knows much more about cars than I do was able to help for a few hours.  

About 90 percent of the work was done by my wife or I.   We make a great team.   I am a larger guy so some places my arms wouldn't fit or I couldn't get to because of the size of my chest and how low the car was she came to my rescue as she is petite and strong.   

I apologize for the textual diarrhea but I was starting to lose faith i would get it back to running.   However WE DID IT!!!!!!!!!! such a great feeling a mixture of relief and accomplishment.   

Based on two different online repair cost estimators I saved between 700 and 1000 dollars doing the work myself.   The most difficult part was diagnosing the issue.   Oh and the oxygen sensor was tough to get out from years of road grime baking around it from the heat.   I tried penetrating oil and brute Force for 2 days before I finally got it to break free.    Such an amazing feeling especially since we are a lower income family.  That money saved is a huge amount to us.   

The only negative to the whole experience was discovering at the very start that someone stole my hydraulic floor jack.   My brother had gifted it to me and it makes a large difference compared to the scissor jack that I had to use.   The hydraulic jack went higher which allowed me better access under the car.   The time difference was the other factor.  6 pumps of the handle and it would have my car plenty high enough. I'd put the jack stands under it.   But because someone decided they needed it more than me it would take 15 to 20 minutes to raise or lower it with the crappy jack that came with the car.   The hydraulic floor jack was much more sturdy as well.   Some day I will get another but I just couldn't afford the 90 to 120 bucks it cost to get another 3 ton hydraulic floor jack.    

Tonight however I am just so ecstatic we fixed the car I'm not focusing on the one negative.   Sorry to blather on and on.   I shared this news with my mom and my wife and kids knew cause they are here and I just had to tell someone else.

I am a larger guy so some places my arms wouldn't fit or I couldn't get to because of the size of my chest and how low the car was she came to my rescue as she is petite and strong.   I apologize for the textual diarrhea but I was losing faith i would get it back to running.   However WE DID IT!!!!!!!!!! such a great feeling a mixture of relief and accomplishment.   Based on two different online repair cost estimators I saved between 700 and 1000 dollars doing the work myself.   The most difficult part was diagnosing the issue.   Oh and the oxygen sensor was tough to get out from years of road grime baking around it from the heat.   I tried penetrating oil and brute Force for 2 days before I finally got it to break free.    Such an amazing feeling especially since we are a lower income family.  That money saved is a huge amount to us.   The only negative to the whole experience was discovering at the very start that someone stole my hydraulic floor jack.   My brother had gifted it to me and it makes a large difference compared to the scissor jack that I had to use.   The hydraulic jack went higher which allowed me better access under the car.   The time difference was the other factor.  6 pumps of the handle and it would have my car plenty high enough. I'd put the jack stands under it.   But because someone decided they needed it more than me it would take 15 to 20 minutes to raise or lower it with the crappy jack that came with the car.   The hydraulic floor jack was much more sturdy as well.   Some day I will get another but I just couldn't afford the 90 to 120 bucks it cost to get another 3 ton hydraulic floor jack.    

Tonight however I am just so ecstatic we fixed the car I'm not focusing on the one negative.   Sorry to blather on and on.   I shared this news with my mom and my wife and kids knew cause they are here and I just had to tell someone else.

happy,I’m pretty sure my boyfriend just agreed to come to Thanksgiving and it’s the first time we’ve spent the holidays together in 4 years,"About 6 months into our relationship (4 years ago) was the first and last time my boyfriend and I did a holiday thing to introduce each other to our families. After that, I fell on hard times health-wise and everything just unraveled. 

If he came to my house to pick me up I’d invite him inside to wait while I finished getting my things and he’d always opt to stay in the car. When the holidays came round he usually didn’t have plans with his family, but declined to come to mine and said he’d feel better being on his own. 

He’s closer to my family than you’d think for someone who has minimal interaction with them, since when I was hospitalized they’d comfort each other and talk about next steps. He even had an ongoing text conversation with my mom about applying for his first mortgage, and neither one of them told me about it until months after he bought his house. My mom knew the sale went through before I did!

I think the fact that we was forced to be at his most vulnerable with them has caused him to feel awkward about celebrating with us, or it could very well be that not having plans with his own family makes him feel like I’m extending a pity invite and hurts his pride. 

Either way, we talked about him coming to Thanksgiving this year, but when my mom texted me today to ask if he’s coming, I sent him a text playfully stating that because she asked me he’s “officially expected.” At first he said he didn’t realize it was next week and that it kind of caught him off guard, which I assumed was his excuse to say no, but I didn’t pressure him, just let it be. Then he said “Okay sounds chill. What time?” 

I’m stoked! I don’t care if my nephew has 12.5 tantrums or if my mom fights with my stepdad for getting in the way in the kitchen, I’m just glad my whole family will be there, because that’s what he is to me. 

Of course he can still back out and that’s okay too, but we’re taking steps in the right direction!",lorsumipem,self.happy,1574465934

happy,Today after a really bad week I became the luckiest man alive,"Some backstory, I am a student at an extremely difficult military school.  I am near the bottom of my class learning a language with an 80+% drop rate.  I fell a bit behind in class and got a rough talking to by an agry NCO.  I was beggining to lose hope.  After studying all the previous day and night and being exhausted from that and early morning army fuck  fuck games I went to grab a drink out of the vending machine to pick me up.  Now this vending machine is unreliable and frequently costs people hard earned money.  I begrudgingly swipped my card and prepared to not get my drink, however something magical happened.  The drink came out and fell, and on its flight towards the ground it caught something.    That thing was another of that exact drink (which I love) both of them came crashing to the ground and impacted at the exact same time sending a shockwave right to the rack where my first drink came from.  This compined superdrink-shockwave caused a third drink to crash down into the box giving me not just two but three of these refreshing fruity morning energy drinks.  I felt like a million bucks, and in language confidence is everything.  I went to my class, gave a friend who was struggling alongside me that second drink and aced the quiz I had been preparing for",gthomas4,self.happy,1574391511

happy,"From feeling completely and utterly hopeless. Giving up on romance and love, I believe I met the love of my life.","For 10 years I believed I couldn't fall in love. That I was broken or to difficult. That I was to demanding or weird. I had some dates but always kind of ended. Most of the times because of their side. I even had a toxic relationship for a few years. And even with this person I wasn't in love, simply because I thought I wasm't capable of feeling that. I was depressed, extremely unstable, insecure and all over the place.

Right now my boyfriend of 7 months (?!!) went to fetch McDonalds for us. Just because he wants to make me happy. The butterflies I havent felt for 10 years rained all over me since seven months ago and only got more beautiful and colorful along the way. I never felt so loved, appreciated and special in my entire life. He gets me. He makes me laugh incredibly hard. He is smart. And he is honestly the most beautiful person I've ever met. And he loves me. 

The girl who was so lost just a year ago couldn't even imagine being this stable and incredibly happy as she is now. Tomorrow we are going to a viewing of an appartment because we're moving in together.

Dear people of reddit, I wish this upon everybody. Never lose hope. You're not broken. I'm tearing up while thinking about it.

My family doesn't go out much, but we decided to see Toy Story 4 not too long ago, but I wasn't too excited. I've been disappointed by a lot of the movies I've gone to see which is why I usually don't go to the movies much anymore, but there was no way I was going to say no to spending time with my family.

I'm watching Woody going through hell trying to save a plastic spork, on the edge of my seat the whole time, then I look over and realize my Mom just sitting there with this childlike glimmer in her eyes, my nieces the same way, nephew fell asleep in my lap.

What if we had multiple soulmates. Say that if the ""gods"" did give peices of themselves to create human kind. These gods had their own loves and these pieces were always trying to find each other.

But the more loves and babies we make the more we split these peices up. Until one day the connections are so weak and lost they dissapear. But this isn't so bad because we make our own loves and our own peices.

So if you feel like you met your soulmate, be happy. And maybe there is always a connection we have with someone, even if we don't notice it. There's always a lost love. You just havent found it yet.",nice_to_be_you,self.happy,1564049452

happy,My son got on the Honor Roll for the 1st time!,"To understand how HUGE this is for him I have to share a little back story. My kid went to a very tiny private school since Kindergarten. With small classroom sizes &amp; where everyone knows eachother and their parents type environment.

My kid struggled with being organized and writing down assignments. He would often forget about upcoming tests or papers due. I would find unfinished homework shoved in his unorganized notebook, or in the back of his desk. When I would meet with teachers they would share that often times after they have given the lesson and assign the in-class work my son would look around and be clueless. Asking, what are we doing? How do we do this... etc? The Teacher would say, ""I just went over it with everyone"".  And sometimes they could go over again with him, but sometimes the time wouldn't allow. I remember studying with him for tests coming up, only to find out he didn't do well. Many tears were shed. School was hard for him and his confidence was starting to dwindle. He started calling himself stupid and self harming himself. which broke my Mama heart. Because he is such a good kid. He's kind to everyone, respectful, helpful and just a thoughtful person.  

After his 4th grade year the principal had a meeting with me about him and the upcoming 5th grade year. She shared her concerns for his success &amp; highly suggested that I medicate him and to also hold him back &amp; repeat the 4th grade. This was gut wrenching to hear. His already low self-esteem would certainly take a hit. He wouldn't be with the same classmates he's had since kindergarten. He would then also be in his younger brothers class (who has no problems with school), and at this age kids are self aware and they talk. I felt so distraught for him. Plus, I didn't understand how repeating a grade and doing nothing else different was going to help him. Because this is such a small private school, they can't accommodate (or have the resources) children that don't fit into the ""norm"". 

I made the hard decision to pull him from the only school he's known and enroll him in the public school system, which had the funding and resources available to help him. He started his 5th grade year there. It was awful hard on him. Everything was new. New, building, new teachers, kids, and curriculum. We soon started him on the evaluation process, which took some time and eventually got him on his own IED plan.  This was HUGE!! 

Come to find out my kid struggles with reading/comprehension. It's hard to do the assessments when you don't know what you just read. Also, he gets anxious if he feels he's slower then the other kids so he wouldn't take his time to understand or do the assignment right &amp; just scribble something down to turn it in. Once we were able to find the problem we were able to address it and tackle it head on. He had a team of supporters at this new school helping him how he needed it. Once the IEP plan was put in place he thrived!

Well, my kid is now in the 6th grade. He has an IEP plan in place and he is rocking it! He finishes his homework on his own, and he's getting A's &amp; B's. It is So SO SOOO amazing to see his confidence built back up. The school posted on FB the kids that made the Honor Role, and for the first time in his life his name was on it. My heart BEAMED with happiness for my son. I know that changing schools (as hard as it was on him) was the BEST thing for him. 

I'm So proud of my son, It is truly a joy in life to see your children overcome an obstacle and succeed. I am happy.",-flyonwall-,self.happy,1580235876

I always used the excuse that I'm introverted and I don't need friends because that's just the way I am. Not to knock real introverts, I just used the title as a cover. But I felt so alone all the time and there were a lot of people who liked me and wanted to be friends but I would always push them away. They would think I hated them or that I was stuck up. Which was never true.

These past few months have been a difficult time and it ended with me ending a 5 year relationship. Throughout it all though, a friend of mine has been there for me to support me through the pain and frustration that led to the breakup. She has been absolutely amazing. We were just friends for a long time but after finally opening up about how I really felt emotionally, I was able to connect with her in a way I never had before. It honestly changed my perspective on friends and my life.

So we started talking a lot. Having regular movie nights, sharing stuff about our lives and generally just doing what friends do which is something I never really did. One day she tells me I'm like her best friend now and that hit hard. I've never felt like I was truly someone's best friend and it feels amazing to have developed that kind of relationship. Honestly it feels better in some ways than a romantic relationship.

I've struggled with confidence and anxiety for quite a while and I have found the transition to Uni to be somewhat difficult, although I've found my housemates in 3rd year to be really supportive and in particular my housemate Sophie.

With climate change being front page news, with many local governments declaring a climate emergency, I decided that I wanted to do something to help raise awareness whilst also going out of my comfort zone and challenging myself. I managed to find out about the World Naked Bike Ride - a fantastic peaceful protest ride in towns and cities across the UK to raise awareness for the vulnerability of cyclists and remove dependence on fossil fuels.

After some research I decided to take the plunge and take part in the London ride last summer. After chatting about it with Sophie she decided that she would also be keen to take part as a keen environmentalist and also to provide me with some support. The ride is classified 'as bare as you dare' so we both agreed that we wouldn't go the full hog but we would ride in our underwear.

We got an early train up to London with our bikes and made our way to sunny Hyde Park and joined everyone else for the start of the ride. We both got ready in Hyde Park where I stripped down to just my boxers whilst Sophie stripped down to just a pair of knickers.

The ride was absolutely amazing with so many people being so supportive with a common core value of helping to protect the environment, and the ride helped me so much with my confidence and anxiety issues - I'm so grateful to have Sophie as a friend and I would urge anyone who is struggling with anxiety to look to their circle of friends for support! University can be difficult but there are always people who are willing to listen. 

 She said she's happy for me to post an action shot from the day

happy,This person made me feel like I was worth something. It was the first time that I truly felt that I was genuinely important to someone.,"Here is the backstory: This person I didn’t talk to at all. I rarely even seen this person. 2 years ago, This all change when there was an event organized by the university where a celebrity comes and talks to the students. She and I got VIP bracelets. I won the contest out of 5 people and since she worked for the event, she was the check in clerk. She got VIP as well. After the event concluded. She offered to take a picture of me with the celebrity. I will not mention the celebrity. She also took a picture with the celebrity. She would smile at me several times after that. This was the beginning of it. 7 months passed by and I got her for two classes and she would smile at me and make direct eye contact. She would sit next to me like more than 5 times. I kid you it was like 10 times. Oh boy, at one point, she said hi and I as well. When she was absent, I would get the missing work for the classes I had her in. She would continue to smile at me. There was several times where I went to the game room in the Student Union and I went to play and she jokingly and playful said that I didn’t like playing those games referring to the Legend of Zelda type of games where it was true but I never said that to her. She knew I like Soccer but that was it. And honestly that was cool and sweet. when 4 months passed by, we outta of nowhere saw each other and we chat and said how we our day and how long do we need to graduate and what classes we were taking and how many left. 9 months passed by and I briefly saw her but I didn’t want to talk to her because she was working with an event outside and I didn’t want to interrupt her. Oh boy, she finished fast because I was like 15 feet away. She was excited to see because she finished what she was doing to talk to me. She didn’t care for anybody at that moment but me. She walked fast to get where I was I believe because it was some what a mid long distance where I was and was and boy, when she got to where I was, she immediately saw me and told me, hi, how are you? and then we talked for like 4 minutes and then at the end of the conversation, she said It was lovely talking to you and boy that melted my heart. I can hear in mind how she speaks tbh.",anonymous989823,self.happy,1580028199

As an extrovert and usually fun going, sociable person, this really fucked me up. But since September, I have been working on myself a lot. I try to talk to as many new people as I can. There was this boy on instagram that would make pretty good memes. I never really talked to him before but I thought he was pretty cool and it would be great to talk to him one day. So I replied to one of his stories and now we chat pretty much everyday. He's really sweet, smart, funny and sensitive about ongoing issues. I'd describe him as the ""perfect package"".

happy,"After the worst year of our life, things are finally falling into place for my fiancé and I.","We moved for his job last spring to California. Things fell apart quickly there as our rental was infested with black widows and roaches, his job was nothing like they said it would be, then my dog passed suddenly after taking a prescription he should have never been on thanks to a new vet. We had to sue to break our lease without negative consequences. Fiancé quit said job and we moved back to our city in August. His family took us in and had been so nice in the past, but once they found out we got engaged without ""telling"" them, the mother and grandmother became major JustNo's. 

My fiancé kept getting turned down for jobs even though he was overqualified. Then once we thought for sure nothing would happen before Christmas as far as hiring, he gets a call from literally one of the coolest employers in the area and they literally create a position for him because they want to hire him. He went from constantly stressed out being the only manager at his last warehouse to now having an office job that uses all of his experience. He's so happy and I love seeing him this way. He doesn't come home exhausted or stressed and we already have tentative plans to hang out with his co-workers and their partners.

Given all the toxicity in the house we're currently living in, we have been seriously looking for a rental and today got the approval on the one we really, really wanted. It's two blocks from my favorite little square in downtown. I'm in shock things have turned around this much in just a month and even though I'm still coping with the loss of my best friend of 11 years, I am hopeful for the first time in a while.

My work is “essential,” and while most of my coworkers have been sent home to work, myself and a few others still need to come in to the building every day. 
While I am grateful to still be healthy enough to come in to work, and still get paid while many others are not, the morale within my team of worker-bees is diminishing. 
I think it’s extremely important that my coworkers and I keep each other uplifted and positive during this time, and i don’t want our work place to be a place of pressure and stress while there is so much of that already out there in our day-to-day lives now. 

i would love to make small and safe care packages to give to my coworkers on Monday who are all willing to still come in and perform our essential duties. I want something to show them that i am thankful for their dedication and perseverance, and i want them to remember that WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER (despite being six feet apart lol). i want my team to know that we are STILL a unit, and that we can still care for each other during this incredibly trying and difficult time. 

i would love some ideas of how i can do this safely, or if you can think of some other way besides care packages, please share! i will do anything to show my gratitude to these people, and lift their spirits so we can continue to look towards the light at the end of this long, dark tunnel.

happy,"I had my high school graduation party today and loved it! But I want to talk about one thing, one person actually, in particular that is just my everything, even if I don't tell him it enough. My uncle","If you look in my post from almost a month ago, I went into detail about how I was taken in and raised by my aunt and uncle after my parents passed in a car accident. And that I was in the backseat when it happened. The only inkling I have of that day is a small scar on my face from the glass that hit me. But otherwise I got out of it okay, but my parents never made it to the hospital. I was officially adopted by them when I was 4. They also told me I was adopted and everything that happened when I was 8. From then on, I stopped calling them mom and dad and just by their names or titles. But I didn't love them any less, of course.

Now I can honestly say that my childhood has been, for better or worse, good. I never really had to deal with bullies or anything like that and have always been close with my family, have a few close friends, traveled a lot, maybe had a bad breakup here or there, but overall I was happy more often than not. My home life was usually good also. My aunt, though the kind soul she is, basically ""ran the house"" but not in a domineering or abusive way. She was just a good motherly figure in general. But I want to talk about my uncle more.

If I had to describe his personality, I'd have to say he's usually quiet, confident, calm, polite, doesn't say a lot, rarely if ever yells, is kind of introverted but can talk at length with people he finds interesting enough, and so much more. Though he never really adopted that ""dad"" lifestyle where he's super neighborly and wears khaki shorts and those New Balance sneakers. That just isn't him. He's more of a working man, always likes making stuff or doing home projects, which makes sense since he grew up on a ranch and used to be a contractor. But the one thing I love most about him is his unyielding and unconditional love he's always had for me.

So let me explain. Every good parent loves their kids, obviously. And my aunt has always been there for me when I needed her. I won't deny that. But there's just something about my uncle's aforementioned characteristics that just always makes me feel...safe. Like even when he'd hug me for two seconds when I came home from school, it was just a welcome feeling being in his arms. Or if we had to go somewhere crowded, and I hate being in crowds, I had to hold his hand to keep myself calm and he never had a problem with it. I also wasn't prone to panic attacks or meltdowns or anything like that, but I had my moments of intense crying and anger over stuff. And every time, he was there. If my aunt got to me first, she'd always help me at least calm down by just sitting with me and comforting me. But my uncle would go a step further by holding my face to make me look at him and say ""Baby I'm here. I'm right here. What's wrong?"". I'd look at him with such fire and fury but quickly go back to sadness before he'd pull me in for a hug nd I'd cry on his shoulder. Again just remaining calm the whole time like he always does. He always made time for me and never seemed like I was inconvencieing him when I had to come to him with my problems.

The lengths he would go to for just the smallest things to make me happy is something I've always loved also. For example, for my 14th birthday, he got me a ""secret gift"", so called because he gave it to me after everyone left my party. He brought me in the living room and sat me down. What he gave me was one of those necklaces that you open up and it has tiny photos inside. The photo on the right was of me and my parents when I was a baby, and the one on the left was me and my aunt and uncle from when I was I think 10, one of my favorites of us and also the same one they have framed in their bedroom. I looked at him with the biggest smile on my face and he innocently asks, with such a loving and hopeful tone in his voice like always, ""You like it?"". I nearly passed out from crying so many happy tears as I hugged them both as tight as I could. Even writing about it here has my eyes welling up.

I know these kind of sappy feel good stories get posted here all the time, but I don't care. I have something to get off my chest and this is it. My love for him can't even really be put into words. It wouldn't be good enough. Whatever a perfect dad is, he's it. He's the only dad I've ever known. And, even though I'm gonna be 19 soon, he still manages to call me his baby girl, sweetie, honey, angel, you name it. Always, without a second thought. Like I said in the beginning, he's everything to me. Always has been and always will be.",outlying_bounds,self.happy,1622254173

happy,I helped a co-worker build his first gaming PC last weekend. It was honestly the most fun I've ever had doing something in a long time,"Now let me preface this by saying simply: I've never built a PC for myself either. That's right, I was a newbie myself. I have a laptop that does everything I need it to and that's it. I don't like playing video games on PC either, I'm a console person. But, I do have some experience in replacing PC parts as I work the help desk at my company. I can replace any needed hardware inside a desktop as needed, even a motherboard, and get it all working as needed. Even if a PC goes down in our office, I can usually diagnose what the issue is fairly quickly and replace what I need if we have the parts.

So my co-worker, Jin, put out an e-mail to our help desk e-mail group asking if someone could help him build his first PC once all of his parts come in. I stepped up and said I'd help because...well, I don't really know why. Jin is a sweetheart and just one of those people that it kills you to make fun of even in a genuinely lighthearted way. So last Saturday I get to his place and bring my own toolbox and legit the first words to me after he said Hi were ""Oh good, I only have a screwdriver"". Now that wouldn't be a problem if he also didn't mention that he wanted to build a fuc--ng desk also. But again, because I'm so generous, I helped him.

We spent about an hour and a half putting together his desk and it was a lot of ""Jin hand me that...no not that one, the other one"", stuff like that and he was having a laugh. But, I guided him through building and he put the legs on all by himself like a big boy /s. And eventually it was all done. Now onto building the PC!

So we both at least knew how to assemble parts on the board and I let him put everything in place. But, his biggest mistake was wanting to put the board in the case immediately, and I stopped him. The reason is because what you want to do is check and see if any of your parts are DOA, Dead on Arrival, before putting it all in the case and having to take everything apart again. So we jumped it by just turning on the PSU (Power Supply Unit) and shorting some pins with a screwdriver to get it to POST and get to the BIOS screen on his monitor. Thankfully, everything was working fine and we finished the build in about an hour, even got him sweet RGB lights inside the case. And then to thank me for helping him, he bought McDonalds for me.

Honestly, this is probably the most fun I've ever had doing basically anything for the longest time. I don't really spend time with other people outside of work. I come in, do my work, then leave. End of story. It was nice to I guess break the monotony for once and do something productive with someone, and learn some stuff along the way. If I had one friend in this world, the closest would probably be Jin.",frosty_eloquence,self.happy,1622131608

I have started a photography project called ""what makes me happy"" where i'm photographing people with things that make them happy, and getting them to tell their story in their own words. This could be a person, an object, an activity... anything that gives purpose and meaning to their lives.

The end goal of the project is to

1. create a book of portraits and stories, with 100% of profits going to MH charities. my initial goal is to print and sell 1000 copies.
2. raise awareness and give ideas to people who are feeling lost
3. generally spread good vibes

I'm displaying most of the project and peoples stories' over on my instagram page ([www.instagram.com/eddymaynard](https://www.instagram.com/eddymaynard) / @eddymaynard) so please take a look, follow and support the project if you can! I have a printing company on board who are happy to print at cost, so there really is a big opportunity to raise a large sum of money to help others.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you all have a great week!

happy,"Being Daddy is hard, but it's the best...","TLDR; I'm so tired, but I can't leave my little girl.

My daughter is a few months shy of turning 2 years old.  She's normally been a great sleeper and has given us very little trouble at nightimes (or at least compared to some of the stories I hear from our parent friends - I know how lucky we are in this regard). Anyway, the last few weeks have been a slightly different story. I don't know why but she's been waking up and crying out for us in the night a few times more.

Other than her nightime waking, she's also not been napping properly durng her day (denying us those precious few hours to get some jobs done without being interrupted or just having a quiet coffee). On top of this, both of our jobs have been horrendous (my wife and I work in health care, which is a tough sector to work in during a global health crisis). My wife is also recently pregnant and dealing (very admirably) with the whole morning sickness thing (I don't take for granted that she has a much tougher deal than me - you women are awesome!).

Anyway, when my daughter called out for me an hour ago (it's 3 o'clock in the morning BTW), I had to steel myself to go into her room and settle her calmly. Anyway, I'm on her bedroom floor right now, watching her sleep and I've got my hand poking through the bars of her cot - she's holding my finger tightly and squeezing them every now and again as she breathes. 

The thoughts going through my head are these - one day, far sooner than I'd like I'm sure, she's going to want me to ""LEAVE ME ALONE"" because ""you're so embarrassing"" or ""you just don't get it!"". Lol. So, although I'm tired, I want to go back to sleep and God knows how I'll manage work tomorrow, I really don't want to let go of her hand. Ever.",Splooie04,self.happy,1627286725

I was sat on my sofa about to quit the job I've been in for 5 years, when I heard the letterbox and went and grabbed the mail.

I opened the card and the words made me realise why I do what I do. 

It can be a soul-destroying job but there's moments where you realise a child you've been working with will be ok.

If I can make even a single change for the better in a child's life, then it's worth the difficult days.

happy,I cried for 40 minutes after someone very close to me told me they were proud of me,"My dad passed away when I was 5 years old. 

Since then, I've lived my life along side my strong, amazing, beautiful, caring mom and my little sister.

She served as my boulder in hard time, while she was herself going through a decade long grief. She kept a stoic face for her children when she was hurting inside, working hard in order to give us the best future and the best opportunities as well as a comfortable lifestyle.

My dad had a best friend, my uncle (also my godfather). My uncle has children, and when he was still alive, we participate din everyone of his family event where I would hang out with my (non biological) 'cousins' all the time. My dad was a big family man and I consider my uncle to be my second father.

Growing up, I didn't think that having a dad was a big deal. I had lived my whole life (almost) without one, and in my head, I think that my mom serves as both my father and mother figure. But there were times where I would think about my dad, be sad, and wish that I was a daddy's little girl, had a protective father, a dad on whom I could lean on whenever etc... When I watched Disney's The Good Dinosaur or the Lion King I would break down crying because I could truly relate to the story on a deeper level. 

Today, my uncle gave me 200 euros and told me he was extremely proud of me as he hugged me. He said it was a present for my hard work throughout the years and for my BAC (a big test 12 graders take in France). I was not expecting this at all. I was happy that my second dad, told me that. And it felt like my own dad was telling me this through him. I felt really emotional. I was extremely happy, and grateful. 

I'm still crying writing this and people might not read this but I want to remember this moment forever.

It lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked. It was amazing. Since then, we’ve been together, moved in, and are almost at a year! We are like the same person, and I could not be more grateful for him. 

It may sound silly but I think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app, or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him. Last year before we met again he had a plan to move back East after college. This year, he stayed in my state with me. Just feeling super blessed and I know sometimes dating apps aren’t great, but sometimes you come across some great people.",surelyshirls,self.happy,1627054297

happy,I (18F) think I’ve actually found a genuinely good guy,"Gosh this is so crazy...

Y’all this man...is honest to God the sweetest and most genuine guy I’ve ever talked to. He actually cares about my day and what I’m doing, likes talking to me throughout the day, he never calls me sexy or hot or anything, but he always says I “look so pretty” or “beautiful” or sweet things like that. He lives a long way away from me so we’ve never met before😅

A big plus is that he’s never asked for nudes. Every single other guy I’ve liked or been with has asked for pics/videos all the time. I just had learned to expect it. But this guy doesn’t do anything like that at all. Honestly I didn’t know that guys like that existed anymore😅 but here we are.

I’ve had 2 boyfriends my entire life. The first one was my best friend for 4 years before we dated, and the other was a guy I kinda met ok the fly and decided to date him. Both of those relationships crashed and burned. These were recent too, so I was a little scared to talk to other guys again. 

I don’t know. I’ve just never talked to someone who is so genuinely happy, caring, and encouraging. I’m a musician, a HARDCORE musician😂, and he is not, but he is always supporting everything I do musically (even though he might not know wtf I’m doing haha); I’m about to release stuff with my band and he’s so excited for me!!! It’s just so nice. He does something completely different than me; I don’t really understand a lot about it but, like he is, I’m super open to learning about it and being excited for him!! 

Well guys. I’m just so happy with this. He said he might be coming down to where I live for some event, but he said we are definitely going to meet. If not this time, I swear we will eventually.

happy,Making the situation for myself better in the last year of high school,"So this senior year wasn’t supposed to be good, it was locked down due to covid and on top of that I always struggled in high school. I was always beaten up, teased, bullied, and was severely depressed and suicidal all up until this point. I looked and saw this last high school year as what was going to be the worst year yet. But no, I said I’m gonna try my best to make this the best year yet. And damn it I did. I reached out to those i wanted to be friends with and they gave me a chance and befriended me. For once in my life I had someone, if not multiple people to talk to in the halls at once, people stopping outside the classroom to wave to me inside, and more. I got invited to parties, talked to girls, and still am talking one who it’s looking good with. Me and my friends did the school softball tournament and I started a team and everyone wanted to be on it, it was the best. It made me and still makes me so unbelievably happy and warm inside to think about this year, and how well it’s gone, so I wanted to share it and just say that no matter how bad things may be, how terrible and sad life might seem, you always have a choice to try and make things better. For the longest time I didn’t believe that, but now I do.",jacksonmesser,self.happy,1627020308

happy,i was in my favorite roblox youtuber’s video!!!,"so earlier this morning, i was playing a theatre game on roblox that’s pretty common for exploiters and trolls to join and try to cause trouble. most of the “staff” in the game including myself are used to this happening so we generally try to ignore them. 

during one of the shows we were doing, a random person glitched onto the stage and was being silly— roleplaying to stab all of us to try and annoy us— and most of us didn’t pay much attention to him. coincidentally, i went on youtube later to check and see if there was anything new to watch in my subscribed feed, and i saw a new video uploaded from this youtuber, titled “ruining theatre shows on roblox with exploits”. i instantly remembered what had happened and what the exploiter in my earlier session had said, but i was still skeptical of if it really had been him. so i click on the video, skim through, and IT WAS HIM. i was in the shot for some time in the video while he was doing his thing and it just made me so happy!! i’ve been smiling so much from it that my face hurts. i had doubted it was him when it was initially happening due to the fact that he wasn’t using his main account, so i’m a bit disappointed i didn’t get to tell him how much i love his channel, but appearing in his video was a pleasant surprise on its own. my entire week has been made from this!",peIIe,self.happy,1626987049

My husband looks at me and says, “oh my gosh, did they just give you one anyway?” They did. The fast food employee gave me an extra sandwich that I wanted to try, just to be nice.

happy,I'm pretty sure I just solved a mystery that has been bothering me since I could remember,"So apparently when I was younger around *pre* pre-school and throughout up until grade school maybe, I had a ""girlfriend."" There's a few pictures of us together. But my parents said we always hung around each other. 

From time to time whilst looking through my old photographs I would see those pictures and wonder, ""Who the heck is this girl? Where is she now? What even is her name?""

My parents didn't know as it was a long time ago. 

Well, yesterday I scanned all of my pictures into my computer to have them safe. That's when I noticed in one of the pictures there were name placards on the table. I finally had a name. And for some reason, it hit me. A name of someone I had spent my entire schooling with came to me.

I immediately go to Messenger to ask her if she was in the same pre-school as me. That's when I looked at her profile picture and compared that with the childhood pictures. They look extremely similar, like strikingly.

The only problem is we were never really that close growing up, different cliques and such. 

But it's just crazy to me that this entire time of wondering who and where she was, she was right there with me the whole time. That is of course if it's actually her. 

For now I'm ""patiently"" waiting for her response.",redrocketinn,self.happy,1606418382

happy,"After a disastrous relationship that made me lose hope in love, I finally found love again","It makes exactly 4 weeks we met each other.

One night, I (19 F) was at a friend's place, together with other close friends of mine. We were having fun, until my friend Jo (let's call him that) starts receiving messages from a colleague of ours. He seemed quite lost and we didn't know what to do. He said he needed to leave in 10 minutes. 'Well, okay', we though.

We resumed whatever we were doing until he had to leave. Then he turns to me and says 'Oh, he (the guy messaging him) wants you to come too'. I was surprised, to say the least, but I accepted. We said our goodbyes and headed out.

Outside, 4 people were waiting for us. They were super nice guys and explained what was going on (a story for another time). Among them was a guy we will call G. I took the time to know everyone (since we were from the same course and all that), but I ended up bonding specially well with G.

He's 2 years older than me (21 M) and a very interesting person. It was extremely easy to talk to him, which is nice to me since I find it very hard to talk to people I don't know very well (I've been working on it and I'm way better at it now :) ). We bonded over memes, the ultimate bonding material, and he told me some of his traveling adventures. We shares some more stories and all felt... so nice! It was amazing to be with him, like it was meant to be.

Later that night, the group slowly disbanded and he walked me home since it was rather late. We kept on talking all night, it was just that natural. At some point there might have been some crying from my part and a very nice hug coming from his, but our convo was generaly nice and I learnt some very cool stuff from him.

The clock hits 4 a.m. and we had to say our goodbyes.

The following day we talked non stop. I felt like a little girl everytime I read his messages. It was such a nice feeling. We talked about how much we enjoyed our late night talk and how much we wanted to talk like that again.

Somehow, I invited him to my house for dinner. We enjoyed each other's company for a while and it was so much fun! We were so very at ease, it was amazing.

He slept over that night. We cuddled like it was natural to us. And, on GOD, there were so many moments we could have kissed. It was the best feeling in the world, to feel so comfortable with someone.

We woke up the next morning and I was the only one that had classes, so we cuddled a little bit more. Needless to say I skipped the only class I had.

Cuddling eventually evolved to talking about our thoughts. ""Have you thought about kissing me?"", he asked. Thinking back, I would be lying if I said no. But it's not like I want to kiss everyone I cuddle with.

I quickly realised in what situation I had got myself into. I felt so embarased I almost couldn't answer. To think I had fallen for him, specially that fast! "" Well, yes. What about you?"" ""I thought about it too. But do you want to kiss?"" I just nodded. It was all I could do. My heart was racing at this point. But he was super nice to me the whole time.

Days went by and spend more and more time together. I feel like I fall for him more and more every single day. We started by taking things slow, as it should be. Today, we plan on buying promise rings this Wednesday.

And that's is that :) He makes me the happiest girl in the world and I make him the happiest boy. Sometimes I think this is too good to be true, like a dream, but when I wake up next to him I want nothing else ♥",_mari_fox_,self.happy,1606237121

So I've always wanted to be an actress, to act both on stage and in front of the cameras, but I was way to scared to fail and not be good at it, I wanted so bad to be ""a natural""... I got a call from one of my teachers and saying the school theatre group needed someone to fill in a spot (she knew I had a passion for this.). I refused on the spot, being too petrified to say yes, but then my boyfriend told me to go for it. I got defensive and we had a fight, until I realised that he was right, so I called the teacher and went through with it. Weeks later, we went to a national competition with a hard play, and to my biggest surprise, I won Best actress in a supporting role! Out of the whole festival, I won it!

We've been separated for more than half a year because of corona, and what's kept us going has been the thought of finally getting to hold each other again and start building our life together. But there's always been this looming uncertainty - what if we make it through this time of separation, but when we finally get to be together, he'll have to go too soon? It's been a crushing reality to live in... dreaming of a long, happy future with him but not even knowing if we'll get that far.

A few days ago, he went to see the doctor without me knowing - he said it was a dermatologist's appointment. He wanted to wait until he knew what the results of the tests were before telling me. And boy, they were so much better than we could've expected... he was told that since the previous tests a few months ago there's been incredible recovery taking place, and that he should be pretty much fully recovered in another 6 months. He was told that there's most likely going to be nothing stopping him from living a long, fulfilling life.

happy,I went to the dentist for the first time in 20 years and I'm so proud of myself for it.,"Going to the dentist for a checkup isn’t really the thing you brag about when you’re 35, but it has been one of my great fears in life and I finally did it.  When I was fifteen I was in a bad bike accident and broke my front two teeth off.  The repair process was awful for me — needed two root canals, and thanks to the extensive swelling and my redhead genetics, the anesthesia they gave hardly blunted anything.  Worse than the pain were the exasperated eye rolls and constant judgement as I squirmed while the dentist worked.

“I already gave you two doses of lidocaine, you’re not feeling anything, you’re just reacting to sounds and smells. I have had 9 year olds in this chair who didn’t complain this much, you need to toughen up so I can finish.”I have a high pain tolerance, but not being believed about what I was experiencing hurt even worse than the dental work, and once I was through the ordeal I found myself with a new sense of anxiety at the thought of going to the dentist.

Everything got even more complicated 8 years later when I was in a serious car accident that left me with severe facial trauma and a brain injury.  Self care went out the window — I gained about 100lbs in my depressive haze, and not only did I not go to the dentist, but I stopped seeing any possibility of a future at all and basically quit caring for my teeth at all, brushing only infrequently and figuring I wouldn’t be around long enough to see the effects of tooth decay.Turns out I was dead wrong — a move across the country and a better understanding of how brain chemistry was dictating my state of mind gave me a new lease on life and I gradually began to work through the messes I’d created during my darkest days.  My dependence on drugs and alcohol faded, and with that change, the weight I’d gained fell away as well.  I started to work out and discovered that despite the miles, my body still had something to offer and I took joys in using my health to get me back out in the world, finding passions I’d thought were dead and a respect for myself that I’m not sure existed in the first place.

I still didn’t go to the dentist, though.  During the hard years, I brushed my teeth MAYBE once a month.  I was certain that I did so much damage and that the second I got in the dentist chair I would be confronted by that and reminded that no matter how hard I worked, I would never truly escape the problems borne out of my worst days.

For years, quiet moments were punctuated by my brain telling me to go to the dentist, but rather than a gentle reminder, it was an internal berating for letting it go this long.  How would I explain 20 years of absence to the dentist?  What if I sat down in the chair and immediately started to panic and cry?  How would I cope when the dentist inevitably told me that all my teeth would have to go, and that all of this would have been avoidable if ONLY I’d come in earlier?

I don’t really have a good explanation for how I finally got myself to make the call.  A moment of inspiration, a second of clarity where I knew it would be better now than never…  I called around and found a place that could get me in despite their 3 month waiting list.  I anxiously counted down the days and nearly called to cancel so many times.  But I didn’t.  I held out until yesterday, when I finally found myself walking through the door and into the chair.

And you know what?  It was so easy.  The staff was so kind, offering support instead of judgement and constant reassurance that they understood how powerful a bad dental experience can be and that they would listen to me and respect any discomfort that I was having without making me feel bad.

Best of all?  No cavities, no tooth decay, and no gum recession.  A totally normal appointment with no work needed.  I’m scheduled to come back in 6 months for another cleaning and I’m actually kind of looking forward to it.  I’m so proud of myself for facing this irrational fear and so pleased to turn the page on yet another difficult chapter in my life.",oh_holy_fuck,self.happy,1643218253

happy,"Three months ago I was a self destructive jobless alcoholic, today I am lively, sober and a top performer at my sales job, about to be promoted to a permanent position","Three months ago I hit rock bottom when I drank so much I had to be hospitalized. In the hospital I was evaluated by a social worker and determined to be emotionally unstable and overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts and risky behaviors. I was hooking up with strangers even though I was too depressed to ever feel excited sexually, I was hung up on past lovers, I was crying in the shower at night before bed, and dragging bottles to my bed to drink all hours of the day. I was developing alcoholic tendencies. I didn't always drink but when I did, I couldn't stop and would entirely forget about my limit until I was sobbing and vomiting. One day I went out to a bar and drank and drank until I collapsed on a bathroom floor in tears and vomit. The bartender in a panic, called 911. I was carried out on a gurney and brought in an ambulance. And there I was in the hospital, after 8 hours of laying in a bed being tended to by a nurse with large glasses and a charming sense of humor, reading a book by Tina Fey because my phone had been confiscated, spilling out the truth of how badly I just wanted to die. That was when it was decided by the social worker that I had to be put in a  psychiatric ward while I recovered from my alcoholic tendencies and constant thoughts of suicide.   


During my short three days in the psychiatrics ward, I was prescribed a new medication and all the hobbies, dreams and hopes I had given up were encouraged to be revived. Doctors noted that in all my harmful behaviors there were elements of self isolation and loneliness, and that I needed more than anything I needed to be surrounded by others that cared. Beyond the care at the hospital was an inexplicable thing, it was if something had just clicked and I realized so strongly and profoundly the simple truth that I wanted and still deeply want to live. When I got out I quit alcohol completely, resumed my old hobbies, opened my own website, started a new job, and moved into a larger nicer apartment. I began enjoying activities again such as drawing, animation, video games, and quickly moved onto buying a vr headset and engaging in opportunities to form friendships again. In the last few months my numbers have gone up and up at my sales job and I'm now at one of the highest percentages of transfer in my sales team. By the end of next week I'll become a permanent member of the company and no longer a temp employee. I no longer drink and don't feel a temptation to. I don't cry anymore or feel depressed. My discord server that I began shortly after leaving the hospital is living, and full of caring friends. I even met someone special. Suicidal thoughts are almost completely gone. I'm so happy. For three years I thought life wasn't worth living and now I am happy again. I can't believe it.",AnonPinkLady,self.happy,1643155273

happy,I am happy knowing that my dad is supporting me through my heartbreak,"Background context:

Iam a 26F who is super close to her dad. I remember I was crying because I have very little luck in the dating scene and I am trying to recover from an unrequited love from a former friend. I have been in love with this former for almost two years but I cut him off because it was too painful to watch this friend fall in love with someone else. And I am currently talking to an amazing guy on the dating app who is even willing to travel an hour and a half to see me for our first meetup. But there’s no telling if this will lead to anything serious and the back of my mind keeps telling me, “But he’s not (insert former friend name here)”

I then cried to my dad that I don’t think I’ll get married or that I’ll find anyone who I love as much as my former friend because in my eyes, my friend is the most amazing man in the world.

And then my dad snorted, “Okay, so when I give you away to your husband, the first thing I’ll ask is, “did you settle for second best?”

I then shrugged, “That’s probably what I’ll have to do if I don’t want to be single for the rest of my life.”

He then ruffled my hair with a loving smile, “There, there…..when you meet someone who returns your love, you probably won’t even remember that (my friend) even exists.”

I seriously doubt my dad’s words are true but it still warms my heart that he is there to support me.",Groundbreaking-Sun68,self.happy,1643059807

happy,my dad got me cake and i feel very loved,"i couldn’t go out with my family for dinner tonight, because i had a bad migraine, and when my dad got home he asked me if i felt better and said he had carrot cake in the fridge for me. 
i grew up living primarily with my mother, who has BPD and substance abuse problems. i remember growing up, all i wanted was someone to care about me or love me just because they loved me, not because they were apologizing, persuading, or manipulating me. i would always dream about being hugged or held. the events from those years haunt me, but i’m in treatment and doing well. 

          i’ve lived with my dad full-time for about a year now and those dreams are my reality, and sometimes when he does nice things for me (like getting this cake) i just become overwhelmed with happiness and gratitude. i get hugs whenever i want them now, and he remembers things about me and my interests, and he asks if i’m okay when i’m sad or sick. i just feel so loved, and that love doesn’t feel like it hurts me. i’ve been (happy) crying like a baby for like half an hour lol. my dad loves me and i feel like i’m finally safe! 
        i also wanna say that i don’t mean to sound pitiful or anything. this is just my life and the reason why i’m happy. having someone show me that they care about me WITHOUT the threat of future punishment, judgement, transaction, etc etc is the best feeling in the world. it’s not even about the cake at this point, i’m just so freaking happy that i can trust somebody and feel safe now. 
folks, please hug your kids! or your parents, if you have parents that accept and love you for who you are. having a loving family is the best feeling in the world, everyone deserves to experience this, i would give you all a hug if i could! :) thank you for being happy with me.",waterfall4936,self.happy,1642998090

I also decided that I would do my best to live by a kosher diet, and that if I couldn't stick with it, that converting wouldn't be the thing for me. I just thought to myself that I want eating kosher to make me feel closer to God, I actually want to believe!

happy,I’m going to talk about all the cool things I’m excited about in the future for a bunch of paragraphs cuz it makes me happy. Suck it.,"Today was my 1 year anniversary with my amazing fucking girlfriend and I just love her so much. She’s so cool and supports me in everything I’m doing (it goes both ways, I think all the stuff she does is amazing) and I’m very happy she’s mine and I’m hers. We went out for breakfast this morning and then just sat in her car and talked for hours. It was pretty great not gonna lie. 

I also signed a lease for a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment yesterday! It’s around $950/month for around 600 sqft (most utilities included, I only pay electric) and the place looks awesome. It’s a 20 minute walk from my work (12 minute bike) and also on the bus route for school. I have a motorcycle, but sometimes it’s nice to be able to get where you want to go in different ways. The bedroom has a nice closet, there’s a cool breakfast bar in the kitchen with a bookshelf, a patio, and a second room that has washer/dryer connections but I won’t use it for that (because the laundry’s right across the street). All in all, it looks like a super cool place to live and I’m very excited.

I’m able to afford this place because I ended up getting into my dream school with a full ride! It’s my state flagship and they’re paying me $22000/yr ($16000 after tuition) to go there! I’m gonna study Anthropology and Natural Resource Conservation in order to possibly work in a natural history museum at some point in the future. It’s nice because I’m able to double major (I have three pre-req classes that I still have to do and that’s it) and still take an elective every semester. Occasionally, I feel guilty that they’re paying me that much money for academics, but I’m working on it. I’m going to save up for a down payment on a condo and hopefully fund part of grad school (I also have a part time job that I make around $18000/yr at and love).

I’m going to try to front load my classes next semester on Tuesdays and Thursdays so that I have Monday, Wednesday, and Friday off from school. A couple of the classes I want to take are only online anyway, so it works out great! I usually work Thursday-Sunday so that would mean I get Monday and Wednesday completely off unless I pick up a prep shift on Monday, which would be kinda cool. I’m hoping to volunteer for our local museum and food bank at some point next year, as well as maybe form a band and play a local show. I think that would be cool. 

Anyway, there’s lots of things I’m excited about in the future and I just wanted to rant a bit about them because I think they’re cool.",queerdude06,self.happy,1648224998

happy,"Arguably the best week of my life. I've ended a relationship and pursued someone new, and I just feel like a new person.","Long story short, I wasn't happy in my relationship.

I knew things weren't working, and found myself thinking non-stop about someone I work with.

I decided to end things over the weekend, and pursue this woman. I was afraid, unsure about my choices, and generally worried. Especially considering work for me has seen several mistakes made in the past month.

Well, one week later, I find myself needing to share.

I'm not dating the woman I've been dreaming about, and she generally seems to like me in return. On top of that, she constantly engages and practices pool with me over the last week. It's my main hobby, and I play in a league. She wants me to teach her. She even showed up to a league night of mine on my shoulder, and I've since had every man at my league asking who this absolutely beautiful woman was.

I played my match tonight. She texted me good luck with kissy faces. I know it sounds corny. But I just shot the best I ever have in my life. I utterly crushed someone bad enough to recieve a commerative award patch.

In the span of one week, I'm literally living in what previously were my dreams.

I know this must sound shallow and crazy, and it could all come crumbling down around me anytime, but I'm just in such utter disbelief how happy I am. How well pursuing what I really wanted worked out.

I made this username years ago while battling depression. Since then, I've quit drinking, lost 57lb and counting, got a job in my intended career field while working on my MA, and I haven't stopped smiling in the last 7 days.

I know this could all disappear. But by God am I happy right now. And I just had to tell someone about it.",nopointinlife1234,self.happy,1648190879

Anyway, I’ve been quite obese for more than a few years now. I was leaning towards weight loss surgery to combat this.

Some people I’ve seen the surgery work for. Others, have either gained all if not more of the weight back. So I was hesitant to go down that road. 

I’ve decided to try intermittent fasting. Have been doing so for 7 weeks now. 

I’ve lost 9kgs and just feel a lot better all around! I wish I’d started this sooner but better late than never right. 

I feel like if I keep seeing results I will be motivated to keep going. I have this voice in my head that says I don’t deserve to find happiness again because I’m used to being so unhappy when I look in the mirror. But I have to keep going.

happy,I could not be happier than I am right now and no this isnt a silver lining story,"I have been fighting high blood pressure since I was about 19 years old. I turn 40 this year. I found myself in the hospital not long ago. I couldn't urinate, I could hardly eat. I had even considered if I had covid. My blood pressure was 185/120. I felt like it was the end for me. I managed to get out of the hospital... and I decided it was time to take charge of my life. I decided number one to stop vaping. Even though I make my own vape juice (vg/pg/nicotine) and have for years, I have thought that VG (vegetable glycerin) was safe so PG (propylene glycol) must also be safe. I have come to learn that PG has been known to cause renal failure in high dosages. This is not the point of this story. I cleaned my life up. I decided I dont want to let stress rule my life anymore. I decided to be more open with my loved ones including my wife and my mother. My blood pressure is still not entirely under control but my BMI is 33.6 and I have just learned that once I get under 30 that I will no longer be considered obese but more importantly, I will have a greater chance of defeating another little known condition called resistive hypertension. This basically means that medication etc really wont do anything for the blood pressure its a by product of weight or rather lifestyle. So, I decided this is it, I started using supernatural on Oculus quest and .. well ...

This is an old habit I’ve had since my not-so-awesome childhood. I talk out loud about how much I hate myself and want to die because I didn’t think anyone heard me. 

Well, I was heard and a concerned friend brought this to my attention in the most caring way. 

I spoke with my therapist and started to track how many times a day I had negative self-talk. The first couple days were alarming clocking in at 8-15 times. I didn’t even realize the words would come out of my mouth, OUT LOUD!

For over 10,000 days I’ve said these words without a second thought to how much they hurt those around me because of the weight they held.

…Not hearing such negative language has also helped my daily mindset. (along with your standard medication, meditation and therapy)

I’m so thankful to finally have people in my life that care about me so much. I’m also thankful that I’m finally in a place on my life where I can hear concern from a friend.

On the first day of my college, he picked me up wearing his work uniform and he knew I was so excited and nervous so he calmed me down and told me everything is gonna be okay like he used to say. i might be 22 at that time but I got so emotional when it's about time for me to get into the class first time. I saw him standing there and looking at me and i got strength from that. I think I joined the class for like almost two hours. After that, I tried my best to get out of the class asap. I saw a lot of college students waiting for their class in front of the room I just got out. My boyfriend is pretty tall so it was easy for me to spot him right away and as soon as I saw him, I just ran up to him and hugged him tight. The emotions I had at that time is extraordinary.

happy,"My last chill-post gave a lot of good vibes to you guys, hope this gives them too!","Hello! Well, it happened again, I found happiness thanks to a place, some music and some food!

Today is a free day, so I decided to get up early and take stroll to a big avenue in my city. Currently I am sitting on a bench, eating some fruit and listening to ""SUMMER BLUE"" (incredibly chill song from 1979, go check it out btw). 
Also there is a mildly fat orange cat on the bench right in front of me.

It's a pretty day, it's sunny and a bit windy!

happy,"""I love you, Latter-Caterpillar-2"" - my best friend","Wow, I can't stop smiling. For those who might have been mislead by the title, this is not a friends-to-lovers story but it just made me pretty damn happy nonetheless. Before I met J, all my friends were either the ""silent"" type, ""cold"" or clearly didn't care about me. Some of them were very physically affectionate yet never said anything that could've made me know just how much they care. Others ""teased"" me (I perceived it as bullying but was too much of a people-pleaser to tell them to stop) but, weirdly, were ready to fight anyone who wronged me. J is different. She's both affectionate and sweet. Just a few minutes ago, during a casual conversation about a project we had to finish together she said ""I love you, *name*. Genius!"". I've never heard it from someone other than family/boyfriend and it absolutely hit different. Damn, you know what?! I frickin love her too. She's amazing and i don't know why, like, only 3 other people notice that. So now I'm going to tell the internet as well haha. J IS AMAZING. That's it!",Latter-Caterpillar-2,self.happy,1647826096

I rang their bell, and they wherent asleep. they where all awake. they had wanted pizza but decided it would be too much effort, so they where happy to end up having pizza anyways! they even gave me scones to thank me!

Earlier today my mom was telling me that during that moment she could just see so much pride and love on his face.

My god I love him so much! I plan on getting a job soon and trying to buy him a Chevrolet El Camino as a thank you one day, because he saw one and talked a good bit on how he'd love to have one. He's done so much for me that it's the least I could do for him :)",Uncanny_Thee,self.happy,1637569587

happy,(M15) How my struggles had help me know who I am as a person and how it made me strong and grow more as a person. My struggles have given me a lot of insights about life.,"I am currently taking 50mg of lamotrigine and 25mg of quetiapine for bipolar disorder and I feel good and balanced.

&amp;#x200B;

**During my extreme highs:**

&amp;#x200B;

I experienced high energy where I felt jumpy and kept moving around the house, I became so curious about everything, I felt confident and felt like I was at the top of the world. I had many plans, I felt like I was the greatest person alive where I helped a lot who had problems. I was very curious about the stories of everyone, helped people though, their family problems, heartbreaks, depression etc. I was so obsessed on knowing everything about myself. My personality, my future, my values, my dreams, my motivations. I felt so excited and nervous about my future which made my head hurt. I had many ideas and theories such as; what is on the edge of the universe, the existence of everything, how Christianity might disappear from the future, aliens, extraterrestrial beings. I even had plans of becoming a famous philosopher or being a therapist who saves people from suicide. I wrote a lot on my journal.

&amp;#x200B;

**During my extreme lows:**

&amp;#x200B;

Everything started going down, I lost energy and started sleeping more than 12 hours a day, my extreme happiness and excitement was replaced with sadness, feelings of being unlovable, hopeless. I forgot everything about me, who I was as a person, my dreams, basically everything about me and I felt empty. I started to question if I should still continue my life or not and I had suicidal thoughts. I isolated from everyone and stopped attending online classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I recovered and what I have learned from my problems:**

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I figured out who were the people who were truly there for me, my friends noticed that I haven't been talking to them anymore and that I wasn't attending online classes. They started messaging and calling me a lot to ask me if I was okay. This was when I told them everything. I also started telling my grandmother and other relatives. The amount of support I got was a lot.

They reminded me of who I was and thanked me for everything, told me that I would always bring out the best in them, inspire them, help them trough their heartbreaks, family problems, by being a good listener and giving advice. They said that I was smart, empathetic, open-minded, never judged people, soft-hearted. A relative of mine who was a psychologist even told me that she admires me for my emotional intelligence, kindness, and self-awareness, my great ability to read and see through people at the age of 15. I was told to continue my dreams of being a therapist where I could inspire and save others and brighten their day.

My highs have given me a lot of insights about a lot of stuff due to the racing thoughts I had. I know what its like to be so happy and excitable where you feel like you are on the top of the world and feel like you can do anything and that life will be all good and happy. I felt anxiety where you would jump into different possibilities and felt uneasy due to the uncertainty.

My lows made me experience depression which is a thing many are experiencing, I know what its like to feel like you are unlovable and alone. I know what its like to struggle and try so hard to get out of bed to do anything, get frustrated because you cant concentrate and finish anything. Depression makes you feel like you are sinking in a dark bottomless pit while you start to forget everything about yourself, it tricks you into believing that nobody loves you and that you are alone and life will only get worse for you.

It helped me empathize with people better because it enabled me to feel emotions strongly and deeply. It has given me an ambition to be a therapist and help other people who are struggling too because I know what its like to feel like you are in a rollercoaster of emotions. It made me realize that our struggles are what makes us strong and resilient. My struggles made a huge impact on me into becoming resilient and emotionally intelligent. I can use my story to let others know that in the darkest moment of our life, there is light, there is hope, and that our problems are what makes us human and strong. We may feel like we are alone, but there are many others out there who are struggling too. I look forward into growth, maturity, and more intelligence.",Dulapeep321,self.happy,1637504514

happy,Taught my first yoga group class and the students loved it!,"I’ve been practicing yoga for almost 8 years now and it has become my life’s passion. 

I started practicing to straighten my posture (which had become crooked after an operation on both feet (age 14) and a lack of physiotherapy that left my in the obligation to learn how to walk again, on my own.) This has been a great challenge both mentally and physically.

Once I became an adult and completed my yoga teacher training, I worked relentlessly for about 3 years to start a business. All I wanted to do was help people and the planet and was so eager to contribute. 
(I had problems with self confidence and public speaking my whole life. It was a huge challenge for me to talk in front of people.)

Last summer, I got a contract with the city I currently live in, to teach 12 yoga classes for the upcoming autumn session. I was so happy and excited but also stressed out! 
At some points I thought my head would explode because of the stress but I remembered everything that yoga is and managed to get through it. 

Last Tuesday, I taught a group class (14 students) and it went amazingly well! The students gave good reviews and seemed to have really enjoyed it! 
The person that hired me said that she had to stop the registrations because there was too many people that wanted to take the classes! She told me my contract would be renewed for the winter session and that there would be two classes a week instead of one! 

I’m on a cloud right now to think that my career is really taking off and that I’ll be able to share yoga with the world! 

Thank you for reading! 

TL;DR : Spent years working on myself and my yoga business. Got a contract with my city to teach 12 classes (once a week) in autumn and just learned the contract will be renewed and upgraded (two classes a week for winter session)! Yay!",Peace4Every1,self.happy,1632530993

* he makes six figures but you'd never know because he lives so frugally 
* he doesn't like blowjobs or handjobs (like really has always disliked them), he prefers to eat women out every single time
* he gets me water without asking and tells me to drink it because i forget
* he sets timers on my work breaks because i have ADD and like to procrastinate
* he also helped me implement an 8-hour workday instead of a 14-hour one
* he learned linear algebra so he could help me with it
* he's going to be learning calculus too, again so he can help me with it
* he teaches me Python, again so i'll pass the class
* he started watching my favorite show so he could talk about it with me
* without asking he set up my fingerprint to unlock his phone without the password
* he did also give me his phone password though, i never go through it
* oh food, he always buys me food and says i'm a cheap girlfriend (any amount of food being given to me makes me happy)
* he has no problem with commitment, is fine hanging out with my parents without me and wants to live together, get married, and have kids with me eventually

happy,I found a treatment for depression that is beginning to work,"When I was really depressed I wanted to find stories of people who found a treatment that worked to give me some hope. I’m finally beginning to feel better so here is my story in case someone else is looking for the same thing.

I’m not advocating for any specific treatment, just sharing that something finally worked for me.

On 12 January I tried to OD on some pills but at the last minute I regretted it, and couldn’t throw up, so I called an ambulance. After the emergency room I was transferred to a psychiatric hospital where I’ve been for the last two weeks. I’ll be discharged on Friday. My health insurance is paying for everything because it’s a prescribed minimum benefit in my country.

Every day here I see a psychologist and psychiatrist. I’ve begun to find and challenge the way I think about many things. The psychiatrist put me on 300mg wellbutrin and I can feel my appetite, attention span and short term memory returning. I just finished reading a book for the first time in 2 years. It’s like the cogs in my brain are beginning to turn again.

There are plenty of lectures and group sessions about a wide array of mental health topics, from learning to control emotions and handle conflict, to learning how most medications work and how our thoughts effect the structure of our brains. 

I’m surrounded by people also dealing with depression, and we share a lot during the group sessions. The relationships I’ve developed here also play a big role in helping me feel better.

I’m nervous about leaving here and returning to work, but now I know I can do it. I now feel that I still want to live in the long run, and that makes me incredibly happy.",Nickkachu,self.happy,1611420335

happy,"We moved today, and I'm just glad my daughter likes the new house, something me and my wife always wanted","So I've made numerous posts in the past about how I lost my wife a year ago and have been raising our daughter on my own. And a while ago, I made a post stating that I finally got a house, me and my wife's dream. It's a little two story family home but it has everything you could need, and my daughter gets to still go to the same school she does now.

I'll admit these past few weeks haven't been easy at all, mostly because the idea of us leaving the place my daughter grew up in is hard. I've slowly but surely trying to get her more into the idea of moving and she's kind of happy about it, but still. I promised her I'd give her something of her mom's too: a jewelry box with a ballerina inside and an old fashioned makeup/vanity table that my wife had as a kid. That got her in a much better mood. 

Our last night Friday was kind of forlorn, for obvious reasons. But she'd been taking lots of pictures of the place as something to remember it by. I made her favorite dinner for her also and let her stay up longer, but I also had a heart to heart with her about her mom. All I said was ""Mom will always be here (I pointed to her heart) and here (I pointed to her head). She never left us, she lives on through us and especially you. And plus you look just like her, like a spitting image"" and she didn't believe that last part but still smiled about it. Finally, I let her sleep in my bed if she wanted but she said no, yet she came in anyway in the middle of the night trying to be quiet as a mouse but I'm a rather light sleeper haha. 

So this morning, me and my brother and his wife, who my daughter absolutely adores, all had breakfast together before starting the packing. My brother borrowed a box truck from his work and we managed to get most of the big stuff like beds and couches all in in one trip thanks to the help of some other friends of his from work. Took us most of the day but we got everything settled and hooked up for the most part. 

But the last things we needed were the makeup table  and jewelery box, which were both at MIL's, her grandma. We said our hellos and my daughter gave her the biggest hug I'd ever seen from a kid her size, she's so full of love. Her eyes lit up seeing them in person, even though they were obviously in need of a good painting. I put some batteries in the jewelry box and let her play with and stare at it all the way home. It was the happiest I'd genuinely seen her in I don't know how long. 

And the rest of the evening was pretty chill. I asked her again what she thought of the place and she was still kind of adjusting to the whole thing but I could tell she was a little bit happier about it, even saying ""I think I'll like it"". There's still some small stuff to move in which we'll do tomorrow probably and I told her I'd bring her with to see the place one last time before handing over the keys back to the landlord. I'll admit I did get emotional a bit seeing us move all our stuff out, but just had to carry on. 

I also meant what I said about my wife and her living on through us. I'm not religious by any means nor spiritual, I just think she lives on through our memories and our character, who we are. And I know that wherever she is, she'd at least be proud of what our baby girl has become.",huntsman_459,self.happy,1616896993

There were a few things I forgot from home and I was short on important medecine so I asked my mom if she could send me a package with them. 

She does. With the help of my father and sister, she sends me a lot more than what I had asked (tons of cute stuff because we all missed each other). **She send it on the 17th of March 2020.** 

I never received it. Unfotunately, with Covid19, there was a lot of problems and nop matter how hard I try, no one would tell me where my parcel was. I eventually came back to Belgium thinking *we'll never see the package again*. The people working for the post basically told us that. That meant a lot of trinket with tons of emotional value were lost forever.

**BUT NO! Today, on the 17th of March 2021, guess what came in with the mailman? You guessed it : My parcel.** I was excited like a kid in front of Christmass presents. I opened it and **pretty much everything is in good shape**. A frame got a little roughed up, but nothing a little glue couldn't solve.

happy,I did what my wife always wanted to and am in the final steps of getting our first house,"A two story single-family home in the suburbs that will still allow our daughter to go to the same school she does now and is honestly just perfect in every way. My wife passed away a year ago and we always dreamt of owning a house, even if it was just the three of us. I honestly can't even express how happy this whole situation makes me.

I took a tour of it a few months ago with my daughter and I myself fell in love with it immediately. It has just about everything we could ever need from a space perspective and also has spare bedrooms that I especially want to have a home office in one. It's nothing too big, but I know my wife would be more than satisfied if she could see it.

Though, obviously, my girl was a little less than thrilled about the prospect of moving at first for one obvious reason: she's never moved before. The apartment we're at now is all she's ever known. Though I got some advice from both my family and others on this site about how to possibly get her more on board with wanting to move, since her mom's passing was still on her mind. So I had an idea and am going to not only let her paint and decorate her room however she wants, I'm also going to give her some things that belonged to her mom. One is an old fashioned makeup mirror (or whatever it's technically called) that she had when she was growing up, and the other is a jewelry box with a ballerina in it that was actually my wife's grandmother's. I showed both of them to her and immediately I saw a change in her. I also told her I'd let her paint both of them on her own if she wants.

Home inspection has already been done and nothing noteworthy to affect the sale was found since the owners had been taking exceptional care of it since they moved in, even adding on to it in a few places. My landlord also knows about the move and the timing was extremely important since my lease ends this month, and he's basically gonna give me a month or so to move everything out once it's up.

But honestly, the thing that made this all easier is my girl. Ever since I told her about her getting my wife's mirror and jewelry box, she's been significantly more into the prospective move. She's been a little forlorn though, just knowing how many memories she's had here. And it's shaken me up a bit too. This is the same place we brought her home from the hospital to when she was born, where almost all of her birthdays have been and so much more. But I know my wife lives on through her, so she's never far away.",huntsman_459,self.happy,1615942566

happy,Finding My Passion through unexpected means.,"It always makes me wonder why the YouTube Algorithm decided to recommend me a movie clip from Son of Batman almost three years ago now. I have never watched a single comic-related video up until that point. 

Though, looking back at my past, there’s always been a pull towards it. Whenever someone would ask, “Batman or Superman?” I would automatically pick Batman without knowing a single thing about him. And whenever we would go to Party City, I would always put on a Batman mask.

Could it have been destiny? Fate? Whatever it was, I’m sure glad I decided to give in and watch it. It introduced me to a whole new world of art and entertainment. I feel that it changed my life for the better. It got me out of the habit of drawing only cats, I started improving faster, I became more confident, and I even started working on my own Batman comic. 

Three years later... I have a Batman tattoo, a bunch of merchandise, art, and I feel like I finally figured out what I was meant to do in life. My dream. My passion.

Thank you to whatever happened that fateful day. August 4th, 2018. The day I started discovering myself.

happy,"My daughter said ""I love you too"" to me for the first time since me and my wife divorced","We love our daughter (she's 13 btw), we just don't love each other. That's honestly the best way to describe the relationship at this point. We look at each other and we know there's just nothing there anymore, no deep, yearning love like when we first met. But no hostility either. We see each other as good friends who genuinely care about each other, but leave it at that. Needless to say the divorce was amicable. We each had our own attorneys for representation's sake, but the filing was fairly straightforward and our visitation agreements between our daughter was agreed upon.

I have to thank my (now ex) wife for making it significantly easier for our daughter to comprehend and make peace with. She really was able to get through to her much easier than I was. She made it clear that none of it was her fault, not in the slightest, and that we both loved her equally. The hardest thing was just us not being together. She couldn't quite wrap her head around that, even though her ears had to listen to some of the more intense arguments we had between me and my wife.

Anyway, getting back on track, we had just finished dinner together and my daughter was still on that tipping point: being a little withdrawn since the separation, but not fully shutting me out either. She went to her room and I was doing dishes and I hear her screaming over the phone at someone, the angriest I've ever seen her. I go to her door but then stop myself and just think ""Let her get it out"", and so I just stand there listening to her call someone a ""fu--ing cu-t"", ""bi-ch"", you name it, and I'm just like ""Woo man, hate to be on the other end of that call"". Eventually things go quiet and I slowly open the door. She immediately tells me to fuck off but I can tell she doesn't mean it, she's just angry at the world.

So I sit down next to her and just very calmly ask her what happened. Here's the jist: Some girl from school that she was in a group chat with said that her mom must be happy to be out of the house and is probably already with another guy because I supposedly wasn't keeping her (my wife) ""satisfied"" enough, and also that they'd probably still be together if it wasn't for her (my daughter). Yes, another 13 year old kid said that, hand to God. And then my daughter basically gave the ""You have no idea what you're talking about"" rebuttal and layed into her, defending me in some way. There's more to it but that's essentially what went down, some girl tried being a troll for shits and giggles.

As she's going into more detail, she's on the verge of tears and I just hold her hand and scoot closer to her, telling her that none of it is true and that she shouldn't listen to her. Even though she's nodding her head in agreement, she kicks her nightstand out of anger and knocks a glass over and it shatters and she screams ""Fuck"" at the top of her lungs. This sends her over and I take the opportunity and just hold her tight against my chest as she bawls her eyes out, screaming and crying at the same time. After she wraps her arms around me, all I can think to do is let her carry on, just softly repeating ""It's okay baby, I'm here"" and ""It's gonna be okay baby. It's gonna be okay"" and I nearly start crying just seeing her like this.

She starts coughing from crying and yelling so much and I just rub her back and kiss the top of her head over and over to help her calm down. She eventually gets to a point where she isn't crying anymore and is just staring out into the hallway. I let the silence just sit there for a few moments before I get her to look at me and stare directly into her eyes and say ""I love you sweetie. You're gonna be okay"" and kiss her forehead before she says ""I love you too"" and I smile warmly but she doesn't smile back, yet I still just hold her close and we sit in silence.

I know this was probably a build-up from all her anger and rage she was holding in since the separation, and I don't blame her for being that way at all. After she finally was really calm, I asked her if there was anything she wanted to talk about but she said no. I reminded her that she can talk to me about anything and we just kind of left it at that.

I know we have a lot to work through, but I'm confident she'll come to terms with the whole thing one day. And if she wants to do something like therapy to help her, I'll be there for her 100%. Anything to make her happy.",AnchoredEnclosure,self.happy,1615876268

Today we went during the lunch break rush and whoever was in front of us payed for us. In a world that’s as crazy as ours, it was a good reminder of all the good things that still happen. I struggle a lot with my mental health and it made me so inexplicably happy. So we passed it on to the person behind us. We were stuck at the stop sign after the drive thru so I turned around to see the guy stop mid handing the barista his card and then to look at me in surprise. He pulled down his mask to smile and wave and I waved back. (My housemate jokes that I should’ve gotten his number). And then I watched him pull his mask back up and give her his card anyways. I’m not sure how many people it passed through, but thank you to whoever started it and to all of those who passed it on. Remember to be kind, it really can make someone smile on a bad day.

happy,Does anybody else have a problem with caring too much about everything? Here is how I managed to control it,"The main issue for me was caring about what other people thought of me. I tried to please everybody, and it took a huge toll on me over the years. I would do everything at my job, taking up every task I could because that's who I was at that time. It took time and effort to control it. It all started when I quit the job I actually loved to start working on myself. I understand not everybody can just quit their jobs like that but what I am trying to say is to start from something, make a huge step in something and that will push you to start improving and working on yourself. And because you took that big step you will no longer be able to go back.

I write extensively about the stoic philosophy of not caring, have a read and subscribe to my blog at the top of the page, it would mean a lot to me. Thank you

I’m a hard person to get along with on the best of days.

But today, after three weeks of complete isolation thanks to social distancing and general laziness on my part, my best friend since the sixth grade drove out to my house on a work night to see if I was okay. He and another guy we both know from high school are pretty much the only people I’ve maintained a relationship since graduating, and we usually talk once a week or so. But occasionally I do things like this where I go AWOL for no good reason. They always find me anyway and treat it like no big deal. I want to be friends with these guys forever.

happy,To be free and do miscellaneous things and start a YouTube channel ~ GLORIOUS,"I’m trying new things!

So I just finished (hopefully) writing up one of my final drafts for my masters thesis last week. In my newfound spare time I’ve been getting destroyed in Valorant because it’s my first time playing a first person shooter...but I keep trying.  I started doing workout videos at home pretty regularly. I’ve been trying all different types of cooking and recipes.

happy,So I'm happy for something good came out of 2020,"TLDR : So there's this band called The Lovetones. And i just went to shuffle on their spotify, to find that they've released a new album. 

That made me happy today.


So let me establsih the premise here, I like to listen music, sometimes a lot. I'm a bedroom producer as well (of sorts).

Now there's this band called, The Lovetones. And I might've been a little low on my music listening sessions due to this job i have. But I still hold the same love for bands i used to listen in college. They're one such band. 

When I found them, it was on youtube, and google results wouldn't give any recent info about them. You can blame it their algo at the time, my potentially generic keywords, or the bands anonymity. So for some time i just hooked onto their youtube stuff.  I didnt have spotify for far too long, because :
 a. it wasnt officially available in my country ( India - our covid numbers are rising!)
 b. Youtube has a comparably good recommendation algo, if you're in the lesser popular part of it. People don't acknowledge it, but yeah, i said it.


Now fast forward, i chose to play them on shuffle today on spotify, where I hadnt visited them in a while. I see that they have  a new album out, and the first song is ""The Circle Turns"" and i just realised how sure i was that i'd never hear new stuff from them.

Some people don't know how that feels, to not hear from some artist you like anymore. 
My fellow hiphop heads would know.

And that! made me happy today - to experience a revival. They released an album after 10yrs, this year.

happy,"Million Dollar Listing: From 2 Years of finding my passion, and working my ass off...","At 16, I fell in love with real estate. After lots of crying, praying, and overall doubting myself- On my graduation at 18, I made the decision to pursue real estate instead of going to college. 

I started with an ""investor"" job in real estate, with inconsistent pay. Then I quit- out on a limb for a commission-based job, and then with that company, graduated to a job that is around 35k a year, plus bonuses. Doesn't sound great, but I work for someone who does the same thing as me (Just much better, and much more experienced) and so it's training on exactly what I do for myself!! And it is very flexible, so I can do what I need to for my book of business as well.

It's been hard- really hard- and I've doubted myself a lot during the process. I put in long hours, and felt like I was putting everything into it. I ultimately only did 2 rental listings, and 1 condo sale.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, an exact year from my graduation, I finally got it. A text from someone wanting to sell, that had already gotten it appraised for 1.35 M. And they wanted me to list it. It still feels surreal, but I'm estatic!",GlitteringGlass,self.happy,1590427115

happy,Bestfriends for 8 years and then we got together! Cute inspiring (i hope so) story of my love life ☺️,"I'm in a relationship with my bestfriend. He was my friend for 8 yrs until we finally got together.

Back in college, he was my buddy. He was the guy who would always make me laugh but i try to hide the smile/ laughter anyway. He always made sure that i would know his favorite songs and carefully put the other earphone on my right ear so we could hear his fave song together. I would pretend being annoyed by that gesture, but deep inside i was exploding with happiness and ""kilig"" (a filipino term for giddiness). I've witnessed his heart breaks, his shallow relationships, and he was there when i got into my first serious relationship. I was so happy with my relationship, i was distracted making it work and i forgot about my best friend. He transferred to a different school, far away from me, from his college buddies. He became a different person to me as months and years go by. The only updates that I heard about him was stories, ridiculous stories, from our mutual friends. 

We went through different relationships, bouncing in and out of relationships for 4 years until we found each other again. He was different. Different from the party guy I've known from the stories of our friends. He grew his hair long, even his facial hair. He's wearing black everyday. He smiles only timidly now, not the guy I knew in college that would smile widely. He was in a place in his life where he's really focused on doing what he wanted to do. He didn't care about the opinions and judgements of others. He knows his true self now. 

He found me at the time of rising up from a loss. I just got out of my 2nd relationship. It was pretty serious. I thought i would die. (Now i know that i wouldn't) A week before we talked again, I went to a 4-day vacation away from the city. I went to Ilocos to do some soul searching. I came back happy. I came home thinking that I could be happy again without my ex. And i really did. So going back, a week later, my best friend commented on my post and then we chat through the comment box and moved our conversation to messenger app. We talked all day all night about random things. About life, about politics, about food.. EVERYTHING. I  felt like we're in college again. We talked everyday. And i noticed how fond i am with him, even though he's miles away. He didn't leave me hanging too. We confessed our feelings to each other and it went smoothly. It felt natural. It felt like, it could happen even before. Months passed by, and we officially became a couple. The happiness we've felt that time is still the same and grew even more today and everyday. 

There are times that i would cry because of happiness and gratitude that he's in my life. We understood each other and we held on to each other no matter what. I've never felt love this way before. I've never known someone as much as I know him, and he knows me too that well. Everything was worth it, every heart break, every disappointments, every downfall, because it led me to finding him again and love him like I never loved anyone else before. 

I hope all of us will find the happiness we all deserve. Even if we went through some hard times, there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel. Just keep praying, hoping, loving and living. ❤️",carinace,self.happy,1590377773

happy,A short encounter w/ a customer that has changed my whole day and made me want to pursue my learning into ASL!,"I have been working at fast food for a few years now but most of the time it’s boring. You get rude customers and a couple of nice ones and then you’re done for the day. Same thing everyday. Today, we had a guy come in the lobby who has came in before when our lobby was closed and we told him countless of times our lobby was closed, and couldn’t have customers yet he did not leave and tried to talk to us but couldn’t. He had a tracheotomy and by my personal observation believe he is either deaf or hard of hearing. Then, he leaves and his brother drives to the speaker and says his brother can not speak and to give him a minute to decide. After a minute or so, drives off agitated because of him. I felt so awful for him and wished we could’ve helped him. 

Today, he walks in and I recognized him and went to take his order very eagerly. I was well aware it was going to be difficult but was up to a challenge to help him. He brought in with him a white board with it saying, “Last time I came here, it was very hard.” Then he had what he wanted to order on the white board. He also knew ASL but I only know the fingerspellings and have not went further into learning the language. At first it was hard because I was confused as to what he wanted but soon caught on and rung him up. We managed to have a small conversation about his frustration of ordering and not being able to be understood. He just had such a happy vibe throughout the whole encounter and was so patient w/ me. 

He tried asking for the price and then wrote it down and I asked for the marker to write down the price for him. I eventually got him cashed out then brought his food out and just the smile on his face made me so happy. He signed “Thank you”, and I replied back with the sign and it made him smile. I’m so glad today was a different experience for him and I made him happy as he did for me. 

It may have not been an interesting experience to anyone else but it changed my whole day, and inspired me to further on into learning into ASL if he or anyone else who are deaf or unable to speak comes in.",Snoo36187,self.happy,1595660146

I’m at a *much* better place than I was a year ago. I’m on the right meds, I have the right diagnoses (schizoaffective bipolar is my main one), and I have an *awesome* therapist. Today, I’m baking my mom’s birthday cake - chocolate, with chocolate buttercream + chocolate whipped cream frosting, and cherries + chocolate shavings on top (she really likes chocolate).

happy,My daughter's recovery is what makes me happy.,"A quick back story.

When my daughter was born she was immediately rushed to the NICU due to shallow breathing. They quickly discovered a large blood clot in her brain that was causing non-convulsive seizures. She was put on a breathing tube and rushed to a regional children’s hospital for a life saving decompressive craniotomy at 1 day old.

All doctors told us due to her trauma that my wife and I should expect severe developmental delays to an unknown extent, from motor function to speech to general learning difficulties...they said we won’t know what is affected until she misses a milestone.

This little trooper has surprised and inspired us every single day since then and is hitting every milestone they told us she wouldn’t, some earlier than expected. Here she is at 8 months pulling herself to stand in her crib.

It’s been a long, bumpy 8 months, and we still have a long road ahead with follow up surgeries planned, but if anyone can rise above, it’s my little girl...and that makes me happy!

happy,Managing to return to the man I once was for the woman I love.,"This might be a tad long so please bear with me. Okay, so there was a recent point in my life wherein I wasn't happy with my job and I didn't know which direction I was supposed to be heading. Because of the sadness that I felt, I tried to eat my troubles away. Because of that, I got bigger. It was a very vicious cycle of me being depressed, eating for momentary happiness, realizing that I looked and felt horrible, and repeat.

I swear my life would have kept going downwards if not for my girlfriend. Even when I was really down, she did her best to cheer me up and support me. Looking back, I hate myself for not realizing sooner just how much she did for me, as well as how sad she was knowing that I changed for the worst. She did her best to hide it, but my dumb brain told me that things were fine and that I could just wallow in grief until something good happened.

Well, all that changed on a particular day. I won't be able to go into any details cause it's too personal for me to share. So let's just say I was supposed to do something for her, couldn't, and felt bad. Again, she tried to hide her sadness but I could feel it that time just by looking at her. That's when I promised that I would go back to how I once was, all so that I wouldn't have to see her veiled pained expression ever again.

I worked really hard and I can say that me and her are super happy again. She became my motivation and I'll always be grateful for her and for how she supported me, believed in me, and just being there for me.

I made something that might help others find the motivation they need to do what it is that they want/have to. Because I know how sometimes it's really difficult finding that motivation, much more when trying to use it to better one's self. Hopefully, it can help. (You don't have to click on it if you don't want to as I also hope that the story alone can help others find that motivation).

[https://youtu.be/Gg0dWWT45Ek](https://youtu.be/Gg0dWWT45Ek)

happy,I feel like lots of the posts lately have a silver lining and even if they are meant as something positive they come off as REALLY negative," Hello everyone, I do not know if I am alone with this but I want to mention it.  
Lately there have seen a lot of posts saying stuff like ""For the first time happy in a long time"" or ""I am struggling so much, but I am happy at the moment"" or ""My life has been so bad, but I am happy at the moment"" and then explaining why their life is so bad... you get the idea. I think this is also against the sub rules, as it says ""No silver linings"". Tbh the longer I am in this sub the more depressed it makes me. I usually feel awesome all the time and reading these stories doesn't make me feel good, it makes me feel sorry for the person. It totally kills my mood and enthusiasm. As much as I am happy for these people and wish for their best, I can't help but feeling sorry for them.  
I know this is kind of a depressing post itself, but I want to see if other people feel the same. If it's fine for everyone, I guess I just need to move on from this sub in order to keep my positivity. Thank you all for reading and understanding. Also I'd like to know how you guys feel about this. Have a nice and positive day!",butidontwantausern,self.happy,1595510028

27/Male FWIW

Over the past 4ish years or so, I've been waging a mental war of sorts with myself following a break up at 23 of an almost 7-year relationship. Depression, anxiety, suicide attempt...it was all there. And who could blame me, we started dating junior year of high school and started together through college! I literally had no idea who I was without her. 

But that was just the problem. I don't know who I am. 

So over the last two years, I've had a mental shift. I get to create myself again into anyone. 

Since 2016 I:
Went back to school and got my degree
Picked up some amazing friends while getting rid of some of the more toxic ones
Increased my credit score by about 120+
Paid for my first real vacation since 2002
Created my first real budget and for the first time have a savings account that I haven't withdrawn from immediately the next week
Lost a total of 5 jeans sizes
Which adds up to about 70 pounds lost

Learned a lot of lessons
And had a lot of beer around many campfires. 

[Here's a look at me from almost 3 years ago vs today](https://imgur.com/a/UKtBVRl)

I still have ways to go when it comes to my weight (298 down from 365), but for the first time in my life,

I'm actually excited for the future.

Instead of being angry, they spoke to me with nothing but unconditional love and support. They recognized that there's a lot thats happened to me that caused me to start using at the age of 12, and just wanted me to get well. They even picked up my cats from my place out of town since I was only supposed to be gone 3 days, and ended up going into a detox program.

Today I went in for the first part of my GED test (another step in bettering myself) and two different guys started flirting with me at different times. 

First guy said he loved my hair, which is currently fire engine red, and asked if he could play with it. I politely turned him down, and did the first part of the test.

After the test I was waiting outside, and another guy came over and started talking to me. A bit of chatting and he asked if I wanted to go out to get a drink together, alone, this weekend. I again turned them down, as politely as possible.

It all started with me meeting this wonderful girl about 6 months ago, she and I started talking lots and hanging out. One thing led to another and things were about to get intimate, I had waited for this for quite some time as I believe it's an important step to take to go towards a relationship. But the one thing that wasn't allowed to happen, happened. I wasn't able to ""*get it up*"", ashamed I apologized and she told me time and time again that it was alright but I no longer felt manly and secure with my self. Once you loose yourself you are truly lost and that's when depression can set in.

During the period of several months we tried again, and the same thing happened again. Now the problem didn't no longer only affect me, it also affected her. She started having thoughts as ""*Am I not sexy?*"", ""*Do you like men?*"" and such, which hurt even more to me.

We had a break for a month until we talkied again and really expressed our emotions, during the messages that were sent I realized that she is a one-in-a-lifetime girl to meet, and I broke down crying. I see myself as a tough guy, crying isn't me; she had opened a new door in my life and I finally realized that I... loved her.

happy,Just got off the phone with my childhood bestfriend.,"Not sure how much attention this post will get but I just needed to vent. 

I just got off the phone with my best friend in Malaysia from my childhood. We used to live down the street from each other all through primary school, but then I moved to Australia for highschool and rarely came back to visit. Even though we never talked or caught up much, we always welcomed each conversation as though we've never lost contact and felt like the time in between became irrelevant. 

So after not talking for almost 8 months, he messaged me, and he told me that his dad just had a stroke. A result of a recent post heart surgery and a very low chance of happening. 

My girlfriend and I were just getting cozy in bed when he messaged me. When I told her about my Bestfriend's dad, she told me that I should call him. Mind you, we have not talked for over 5 years since I last saw him. The only words I had seen were from his responses to my messages, and for the first time in a very long time, I was nervous thinking just how to talk with him (the last time would've been the first time I met him when we were kids!) 

Anyway, so I rang him up. Didn't take more than two rings when he answered my call. As soon as I heard his voice, my eyes started tearing and I had to control with everything I had just to keep my voice from sounding shakey. 

***I missed him so much.***

He was the brother I never had and we had over two decades worth of memories. He's the brother who would be at my wedding as my best man, as I would for his. I could hear his voice was also trembling, possibly the same reason, but most likely from feeling numb; he was still at the ward waiting for a response from the doctors about his dad.

We talked for about 15 minutes, and we brought each other up to date what was going on in our lives. It was good that his whole family were there for his dad, not knowing if he had hours or days to live. We ended the call when he felt his dad begin to stir. 

I'm just so ***happy*** my girlfriend convinced me to give him a call. Though brief as it were, I'm glad my bestfriend and I still share that special brotherly bond that no matter how far or busy we are, we can always reconnect without any issue.

Sorry for any grammatical issues. Still tearing up as I write this from my phone. That and also still messaging him how his dad is going at the ward. 

Love you all, Reddit. Stay safe.",woe2thepubliceye,self.happy,1545837202
happy,"I found the one for me, and I've never been happier!","A couple of days ago, I proposed to the woman that I'm going to marry. She said yes! I'm 27, she's 22. I never, ever in my life expected to be this happy. I came out of a toxic relationship that I didn't know was toxic prior to meeting her.

&amp;#x200B;

My son loves her. He and her got along the moment they met, and they're inseparable at this time. All during Christmas, he wanted to spend time with her. He never did that with any other woman I dated before I met this wonderful woman. He asks for her, plays with her, shows her everything, sings to her, you name it. I cannot name a single time in my life that I have smiled so much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so happy it's crazy to me. I never in my life anticipated to be smiling this much, excited to wake up, excited to see this wonderful woman in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know who else to talk to about all of this. I get anxiety when I talk to people in person about personal life matters, so I wanted to just share this with SOMEONE!

&amp;#x200B;

I never knew how it felt to be truly happy. I finally do. This is amazing, and I'm so, so excited to continue on this wonderful journey called life.

Complaining to my boyfriend about my luck he drove for 45 minutes in the snow in the at 6 in the morning to bring me tampons.

happy,My wife and I finally tied the knot after three years together!,"Today, my wife and I finally ""got married."" We were wed two years ago today in another country. When we returned to America in January, we had a lot of stuff to get in order and we struggled with when/where/how the ceremony would go. 

Then she got pregnant and all that just kind of went out the window. She's been feeling pressured and stressed the last few months, so I decided to call up my sister and get some surprise plans going. 

My sister and her husband came over Saturday. Sunday, we headed to Tahoe. It was my wife and I, our two kids, my sister and her husband and my buddy. My wife just thought it was a nice Christmas trip. She had no idea my sister and I had contacted her entire extended family and scheduled them to be at the reception (which is going on now).

Last night, all the ladies got pampered. In the morning, I got up before my wife and set up my plan. Left a note on my pillow and snuck out. Our daughter took her on a surprise scavenger hunt while we set up everything. The scavenger hunt ended in her finding her special, sparkly white dress that she's always looking for an excuse to wear. 

When my daughter brought her to the garden of our cabin, my buddy and I were waiting. I could see the moment she realized what was happening. The tears just started flowing. Then I couldn't keep them in. She just looked damn stunning.

happy,About time,"Today was one of the best days of my life.

Over the past year and a half, I’ve been struggling with mental health — most of it revolving around loneliness and lacking genuine a physical connection with someone. I’m going into my senior year of high school, and I haven’t yet been in a relationship, which is even harder to deal with when everyone around me has.

All the while, I’ve had this crush on the same girl, a close friend, going back to maybe even three years ago. And she’s been in a few relationships, so it was hard for me to be with her, but not actually with her. Friendzone, feelsbadman, etc.

But after she broke up with her last boyfriend, I was the first person she called. I made her laugh, and I helped her through what was a really hard thing for her to do I guess. And eventually, we got really close.

We have similar extracurriculars, which resulted in us both going to the school’s music camp, and on the way back I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out, and she said yes. This was last week and we went out today.

We saw a movie, had some laughs, a good time.

I managed to convince them to give it a try and we went through the first chapter. It took us about 6 hours. Everyone was having a blast.

At the end they said I had renewed their love of D&amp;D and cannot wait to play again and the 2 who had the falling out were talking and laughing and genuinely enjoying each others company again, even outside the game.

happy,i reckon things get better :),"I'm not sure who'll read this but i'm just feeling happy (spoiler it's cheesy)

So at the beginning of the year, i was in a long term relationship and safe to say it pretty much hit the rocks. i had never felt so...upset, lonely, and disjointed before. i was unhappy in that relationship, and i knew that but i just couldn't let go because i was scared of what i'd be left with if i did. i was with someone that pulled me down rather than lifted me up, took everything while i gave and gave, berated my self confidence until there wasn't a sliver left. I contemplated, and contemplated, but i was too afraid of the change that would come if this massive chunk of my life got cut out. But ultimately, it did end. Not on my terms, but it ended nevertheless. 

It took me months to recover and it might sound dramatic but everything just felt out of whack. it was so unfamiliar and cold to go from talking and confiding in one person every day. a person that knew every dark secret, every flaw, every insecurity to becoming a stranger. my heart felt twisted and my stomach riddled in knots. i lost weight actually, when my ex started dating someone new a month after. it wasn't intentional! but i just felt nauseous and couldn't bring myself to eat, i felt depressed, felt my self worth diminish. and i couldn't see myself getting out of this dark and all consuming hole.

but i did :) i started to realise that i placed the responsibility of my happiness, my self worth, my self confidence into the hands of someone else. i believed that that one person was the sole of my happiness and without them how could i ever be happy. once i realised that thought and realised how incredibly wrong and incorrect it was, was when i started to self heal. i realised that i needed to be happy and content with myself and by myself. because i'm the only one that's ever going to be there for myself forever, it's always a massive help to have a network of family and friends there supporting you, but ultimately it's something that you have to fully believe in yourself. i adopted numerous techniques to help build my self esteem up and i reckon they were super helpful in my quest to loving myself again. as cheesy as it is. 

and now as we're nearing the end of the year, i'm the happiest i've ever been. i'm content with myself and i've learnt that in the healing process it's okay to be alone, it's okay to rely on yourself, and it's okay to let yourself feel all the raw emotions before you ultimately recover from it. it does take time, and it is different for every person, but self happiness is always reachable. even in times when it seems like it isn't....ahh and i've strangely unexpectedly found someone along the way that adds to my happiness rather than forms the base of it :)

TL;DR your happiness shouldn't be derived or based off a person, once that's realised life becomes blissful",sadovrthnkr,self.happy,1566823439

happy,SO is a keeper.,"I've been collecting fossils for a few years now, bought a few but found most of them. They sit in little plastic containers that I pull out whenever I find more or I'm hanging out with anyone who shows interest in fossils. I have so many of certain kinds that I've gifted some to young children and friends who like them. 

My SO is a trooper about all the random fossils boxes around the house. Only recently has he mentioned trying to contain them to one room. Honestly it was getting ridiculous, like every few weeks need bigger containers ridiculous. I've been stopping myself from bringing new ones home unless they're really good ones or something I don't already have. 

The other day after work he comes home and hands me a big peice of fossilized coral. 

""Is this a fossil? It looked like one but I wasn't sure. Do you have this kind? It's big I wasn't sure if it was too good to be true.""

My heart. Yeah I already had a few peices similar but none of that size, plus he carried the damn thing around for hours just in case it was. 

I know he's not really into it, and doesn't understand why I keep bringing them home, but he saw one and picked it up none the less.

Made me happy, didn't know where else to post.",BoredsohereIam,self.happy,1566751473

It ended up being the best time I've had in a looong time.

My relationship with my sister, who's my best friend, has drastically improved and we had so many laughs.

My boyfriend was a total sweetheart and bonded with my family even more.

I'm finally on a medication that is working for me and I actually feel normal for the first time in a long time.

I have a job that is fulfilling and interesting.

I live in a beautiful home that is safe and comfortable.

I am overwhelmed now that I have finally realized how blessed I am and how almost perfectly my life has changed in recent months.

I just feel... Good. Finally.

He's so patient with me, he gives me attention and love all the time and reassures me that it's okay even if I end up taking his attention away from a night out with his friends! 

The past few days I've been away visiting family and hadnt heard from him, so gave him a call (kinda late at night but he's normally up) he was asleep, I woke him up,  he answered and I told him I hadnt heard from him and I just wanted to, he was absolutely so sweet.

Honestly I barley even think twice about it now 

“oh shit not again, ....what’s on Netflix” 

I’m sorry but I don’t want to be a guy that stands on stage and motivates you for 30 mins to a YouTube video. 

We all want to help another and the good earth is rich

At least that’s what we tell ourselves. 

Greed has poisoned men’s souls. We have developed Speed but we have shut our ourselves In. We think too much AND think too little

You are not machines! You are not cattle! You! You the people! Have the power to create, create life, create happiness! 

Now let us fight. 

Fight for a life. Fight for Your life!

What I want people ask me someday “how did I make it? How do you do it!?

It’s because I never saved anything to go back.

If I go back, back to the dog days, the bad days, the days nothing made sense

Where am I
Who am I 
Why am I

No. 

I won’t go back. 

Somewhere along the line we stop being us. Things get hard. So we do what everyone else does. We conform. We go to work. We hate it. We go home. And we STILL HATE IT. 

I hate it. 

So what do we do. 

We start looking for something to blame,but I’m the end we are just like a big shadow. Shallow to the thoughts and feelings of others. 

In the shallow. 

But you can see through it now. 

Until you start believing in yourself, you will never have the wealth. 

Wealth. 

What is wealth?

It’s where we been, who we are, how we got here. How much love we have. How much Heart we have. 

We’re not going to be billionaires, millionaires, hell any  heirs.

But we can lay it ALL on the line. And if we do THAT and we at least TRY! 

Just try. 

Just a little bit.

Then we can not lose.",Socalfan87,self.happy,1569045573

happy,I am so happy.,"I am sharing this from an account I barely use..

My first suicidal thought was when I was maybe 7 or 8. It was brief and I got a few more years before they started coming in waves. Before long, I was drowning in them. By the time I was 14, all I wanted was to die. 

When I was 26 or 27 I was finally so exhausted from feeling this way that I admitted myself inpatient. I received a diagnosis (a few actually) and that was my first step into the light. The death sentence was lifted and I pursued treatment in a very deliberate way. 

Two weeks before I turned 31, one of my brothers committed suicide. My siblings and I were five, and then suddenly four. I watched my family ache and mourn and cry and yell. 

I had not wanted to die in years, but I realized that the things I had put my body through might mean that it was a near fate for me anyway. I have spent every day and night obsessing over my health and all the ways I had certainly sentenced myself to an early death that would no doubt come at any moment. 

Today, after months of constant fear and anxiety, I took myself to the ER for chest pains. Chest pains that I have had constantly. They ran bloodwork, an EKG, and X-rays. I was sure they would tell me that I have been having heart attacks and was on borrowed time. 

All tests came back clear. My heart is healthy. It is the right size. There are no masses in my lungs. My bloodwork came back fantastic. 

I cannot believe that I am so lucky to be here. I am so happy that I will not be putting my family through another loss that could have been avoided. I know that anything can happen at any time, but there has been severe concern over my heart health and also my lungs. I am relishing in this free feeling. 

I am so, so grateful and I will continue to not take my time here for granted. ",DiamondRavioli,self.happy,1551140433

happy,DnD helped me leave behind several months of depression and isolation. Never thought it was possible :),"I left my job at the end of last year to focus on some medical issues I'd been dealing with. I visited several doctors and realized I'd probably be facing a lifetime of specialist appointments, medications, and therapy sessions. Even though I'm in my twenties, I started to feel like life was over so hopelessness took over my thoughts.

When I got a new job, every single day was a struggle. It was hard to even get out of bed in the morning, so my performance was suffering. I couldn't focus on tasks and failed to meet deadlines, so I was terminated before I could get health insurance. With no source of income, bills started to pile up and had no way to buy the medication I needed. I'd been depressed before but this time I couldn't handle it. I stopped eating, slept for 20 hours a day, and ignored friends and family. I completely gave up on life and was desperate for a way out.

Around that time, I got invited to join a DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) group that was starting a new campaign. It was something I'd wanted to do since middle school, but I didn't know anyone who played or where to go so I was excited for the opportunity. I finally had a reason to get out of bed, at least for a couple hours each week.

I was nervous to meet the group, but the DM is an amazing person and the players welcomed me right away. I don't know how, but it felt I'd known them for years. I hadn't hung out with anyone for so long I'd forgotten what it was like to have fun with other people. I didn't realize how lonely I was.

The social aspect got me out of the rut, but the actual game changed me. I created my character and tried to roleplay for the first time in my life. Whenever it was my turn, I had to make a decision and had the ability to do whatever I wanted. It felt so good to pretend I had confidence and the ability to solve problems. It was all fantasy, but if my character could win a fight then so could I.

I've gotten close to the group and they're some of the best friends I've ever had. We only play once a week, but we've been going out to get drinks or see movies. It's been awesome to get texts I don't want to ignore. One of the guys even helped me get a job with his company and I start this week!

I can't believe DnD, of all things, was what I needed and I'm so thankful I met these people. When I needed a life saving throw, I rolled a nat 20.",FiveOhFive91,self.happy,1551085464

I teach and live abroad and chose not to renew my contract at my current school meaning I would be unemployed come March 1st. I love my school and have become incredibly close with my students and even followed them when they moved up a grade so I could still be their teacher. 

I simply feel it is time for me to move on. 

Knowing I had three months until the end of my contract i began applying to other positions abroad. Let me say, applying to jobs in foreign countries can be incredibly tedious and discouraging. There are a lot of misleading job postings that can put teachers in difficult or even dangerous situations. 

Three months of daily job hunting and I only ended up applying to six schools total. Of the six, four offered me the position. Of the four, only two had contracts that fully matched the information in their job advertisement. 

The weight on my chest grew heavier with every passing day. If I didn't secure a job before the end of my contract I would be forced to leave the country, which would be a very big financial burdon and make finding a job even more difficult. 

But today, with four days left in my contract, it happened! I was finally offered a position in a school that matched exactly what i am looking for! I feel like I can breathe for the first time in three months.

Her stubbornness encouraged me to stick around and nudge her in healthy directions.

happy,After almost 10 years of depression and very many ups and downs Im now for the first time in my life positive about the future!,"High school for me was a VERY eye opening and intense experience in a way that I started realizing stuff about myself, other people and the world and it felt like it all happened too quick for me to process it all ""correctly"".

Up until HS I didnt really worry about anything, I very rarely studied and still passed with good grades. I had many good friends I hung out with a lot and I was a nice but a little shy and ""scared"" kid.

When I started HS all that shit changed. I dont know if it was because I started growing up or if it was just a totally different environment than I was used too but all off a sudden I was thinking about stuff I never ever had thought about.

My train of thought had suddenly changed over what felt like a night and A LOT of new impressions, people, thoughts, lessons etc entered my life and I believe I got overwhelmed.

I realized I had picked the worst fucking direction in school (I picked a technology oriented class for my 3 years that I thought was a perfect fit for me) but I liked the people in my class and decided to stick with it, how hard can it be right?!

Hard AF. I started failing tests and later grades. I became the class clown and started partying a lot. I also played a lot of WoW back then and that evolved into me staying home from school playing WoW because I hated waking up early to sit in a class that I wasnt going to study for anyway.

My mom left her BF (someone that I looked up to a lot and he was more of a dad to me than my actual dad) about this time and we moved into the city. This resulted in my mom being a little more loose with rules and I ended up with a lot of responsibility, maybe a bit too much for me back then.

I became a full blown, aimless slacker who ""graduated"" school with 9 failed grades and up until about 2 weeks ago Ive had a ton of different jobs that never ended in something real. Ive done A LOT of drugs and many times prioritized them over life. Ive lied, cheated and ignored way too much stuff and Ive been overall very unhappy about my life since my 2nd year in HS basically.

The last 8 months Ive been unemployed because Im lazy and I have no idea what I want to do with my life wich made me hate my life even more and Ive borrowed so much money from my family that I wasnt sure I was ever going to be able to pay it back or even sustain myself any longer.

BUT, 2 weeks ago my dad asked me if I wanted to help out at his job (he works as a carpenter, wich I have some experience in). I obviously said yes even tho I had to get up at 0515 in the morning and do physical labor all day and the money I would make wouldve payed my rent for another month.

I ended up working the whole week and on friday that week his boss asked me if I wanted to work there full time. My first thought then was ""no thank you, Im NOT getting up this early every fucking day, no way."" So I told him Id think about it and have an answer on sunday.

But then I started thinking about the past 10 years and how fucking miserable theyve been AND I also realized I felt really fucking good about myself. I did something that actually mattered for once and I felt happiness, something that often got shadowed by worries about money, the future, my relationships etc. So I texted my dad and told him to tell his boss that Id be happy to work there.

Ive now worked 7-4 for 2 weeks and I havent been this happy about myself in a long fucking time. Theres literally 0 worry in my head. Im for the first time in my life thinking and making plans about the future. I feel like a real human being now, someone that actually contributes something to society and someone that people can trust and ask for help with real stuff.

I just realized this became waaay longer than I planned and hopefully someone reads some or even all of it! Im just **SO** fucking happy about everything, and Im also a little drunk.

I just want to shared my happiness with everyone and perhaps even give some people hope that its not going to suck forever. Thank you for reading! &lt;3

happy,I got into university! Came at the perfect time!,"I'm a senior in high school and have been going through a rough patch, I lost my grandfather last week and been going through a bit of a medical situation, all very draining and tiring. Not to mention, the entirety of my friend group had all got admissions. This was my first, and when I got the email I cried, I had such a fear I wouldn't be going anywhere in the fall, and this has been an enormous weight of my shoulders. This was my first acceptance but it was also to debatably the hardest program I applied to, one which I worked incredibly hard to obtain a good average for. Tt's given me such a burst of happiness and I couldn't have been more grateful for this sign of ""everything's going to be alright""! I am so excited, the school is the same in which my brother's already attending so I'll get to see him more regularly too!",Promisethevoid,self.happy,1550986865
happy,Had a shared birthday night with a new work friend. First time ive enjoyed my birthday since i was 17.,"Little bit of a long one but it's truth!

Little background first. So after a year out and traveling I  got home and got a job with a local electrician firm. Another guy, let's call him Luke, started 2 weeks or so after me. Like is mid 40's married and has two kids. 

So any way me and Luke weirdly have become really good friends and he's a really good teacher and even though I've been qualified for 4 years he's probably helped me progress the most in the 8 months or so of working together than the 9 years I've done this job for. 

So one night while working late on a really rubbish job Luke proposed we have a joint birthday night out with work mates to try bond a bit, (good guys, not that open though) as our birthdays are 12 days apart.

At first I was pretty sceptical because I have been let down on two of my biggest birthday so far by people who I thought were really good friend. I invited 22 people to my 18th and 5 showed up, I invited 18 people to my 21st and 5 showed up. And Luke knew this because we chat. (I now only have 5 people I class as actual friends)

So we invited everyone at work and told them dates and plans. Myself and 4 others turned up, good numbers for a small company to be honest. We started at the bar for a couple pints before the train. I won winner stayed on the pool table for 3 games, never happens, don't know how but a good sign for the night. We had 2 pints and got on the train. On the train we stood with some football fans who had been at an away game, they gave us a can of beer each and we had a great laugh with random lads on a the train, class. 

We got to our stop and headed straight for the casino. I'll add this is the first time I've went to a casino to gamble, I've been once before for the stake and late night beers. I saved £150 over a few months wages for money I could lose and not really miss. We were at the casino for around 5 hours and played roulette and black jack one after the other. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing or what was a good bet but it was fun and at one point I was £100 up from my original £150. I left £60 up and absolutely loving it ha.

Two of the guys called it a night and left so Luke, myself and Luke's brother got a taxi home, sat out in the back garden for around two hours and had 4 drinks and chatted rubbish.

I'm in bed now and I know Luke will never see this because he doesn't have Reddit but thank you man, tonight was amazing. I've disliked my birthday for a long time but tonight was 10/10.

A good friend making a little effort has made my night, probably week. This is the first time in a while I've really been happy. It's nice. 😊

happy,Today was the most amazing day I’ve had in a long time.,"While writing this I’m currently sat by a campfire at night, looking up at the stars every so often with the biggest smile I’ve had in a while. 

I’ve had a bit of a shitty time just in general recently, but my 18th birthday today has been amazing. 

Waking up in a tent on your birthday isn’t the most conventional, but it’s what I love. I opened the present that my lovely mum had gotten me, some chocolate and some books part of my favourite series. 

We climbed up the tallest mountain I’ve ever climbed, I felt on top of the world and so amazingly accomplished. 

And tonight there’s been a celebratory drink out (I’m in the UK so with the drinking age being 18) and then eating in a restaurant. 

Coming back to look at my phone and seeing the lovely birthday messages from my close friends, but also some others that I didn’t know even thought about. And also seeing that my crush sent me a small birthday message too really was the cherry on top of the cake that has been the perfect day.

What makes a person truly happy, to me, is the people you surround yourself with. Everyone you let into your life influences it in some way or another, and you just have to hope they end up doing more good than bad.",Alyxea,self.happy,1550958103

A few years ago I wrote a story just for fun (and attention) and recently a film producer approached me about buying the rights to it. Then I won an oral storytelling contest in my city, which I also entered only for fun. Now I'm negotiating writing the story for a choose-your-own-adventure computer game. All three events are unrelated except that they're about telling stories.

It's very surreal and unexpected. I make sandwiches part time while studying in an unrelated field, I had no plans to do writing or storytelling as a profession and in a matter of weeks it seems like it's all I'm doing (in the best way).

Hosted some international guests in a semi-important event over the weekend which went incredibly well - for the first time in many years I felt respected in my field, looked up to, and appreciated.  I even joined them for an impromptu dinner and was the center of attention (at least for my side of the table) connecting and conversing easily with total strangers from around the world.  

Got my finances in order with a budget and consolidating some old accounts - turns out I'm doing much better than I thought, and am in the process of thinking up some ""me"" things I can do with a few extra bucks I have for ""fun money"" every month.

Summer is just around the corner - which means a month ""off"" in academia before summer classes start back up, which is desperately needed.  The sun is out, the birds are singing, it's perfect shorts and a hoodie weather.  I might spend the (imminent) sunset outside watching the sky change colors.

Not sure if anyone reads these kinds of posts here, but just wanted to hopefully brighten someone else's day by sharing a bit of mine.

Life is good.

Today, the two of us are some of the happiest people around!","Back in January or so when I first started picking up on the fact I had feelings for this girl, I assumed I didn't have a chance in hell with her. From my perspective, I thought she was the girl that would only ever be with the kind of guy that was super popular, good looking, etc. In other words, not me of all guys. I always have considered myself to be just average - not bad in the slightest, just not exactly what a girl like her would ever be looking for - but I knew a somebody like her was worth at least trying for. This all explains why I didn't start talking to her until around the end of February; I didn't want to be shot down by a girl as wonderful as her. Well luckily enough for me, I am exactly who she wanted to be with too. We talk all the time now, and both of us feed off each other's energy. When one of us is ever sad because of outside stuff going on in our lives, the other is always there and we help each other through the toughest of times. These times only strengthen the two of us, and whenever one of us is stressed out about school, family, friends, etc., we always know we can count on the other to help calm ourselves down and make things easier to handle. I love this girl so much. She makes me so happy and I always look forward to being able to spend time with her. She is hands down the best part of my life. When I look at her I see nothing but perfection. Being with her motivates me to do all I can to become a better person. She's everything I could ever want and more. I do not have the words to explain how lucky I feel to be with her. I look so forward to the many more great memories and experiences the two of us will share together.

happy,I’ve finally come to terms with my sexuality and I couldn’t feel better,"Not really in a position in my life to tell those i’m close to. I’m 19, male. Just about to finish my first year of college. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Posting this around reddit to get it out.

I’ve always had some semblance of non-straight thoughts. I had a consistent girlfriend throughout high school and while she did figure out my feelings for a male friend of mine once, I mostly kept the feelings at bay. After all, I WAS in a relationship. There were struggles at times. Most of them weren’t major, however.

After my GF and I broke up senior year of high school, I had a few flings with some random girls. It was fun, yeah. There were always the lingering gay thoughts, though. I suppose I never properly addressed them.

As of recently, though, I’ve been struck by more and more intrusive homosexual thoughts. Perhaps it’s due to my recent use of LSD in a somewhat serious spiritual context; I don’t really know. I do know thwt it feels like a flip has switched.They don’t bug me at all and I’m happy to have finally renounced my fears and become honest with myself.

Too bad I’m not in a position to tell my friends or parents. I guess I just needed to let someone know. Not really sure where to go from here.

TL;DR: Been questioning my sexuality my whole life, I’ve only currently been with women but I’ve fully accepted and realized my sexual and romantic attraction to men.

**So**, what now? Does anyone have advice for ways to help me accept it more deeply? And tell my friends or parents? 

It’s just a confusing time in my life, haha. What I DO know, however, is that I feel so much more at ease with myself now. And wow, that’s a happy feeling indeed.

happy,I pretend to watch the same tv shows as my gran so that she feels like she has a reason to message me twice a week.,"I message my gran every week, but I always felt like she felt like she couldn't message me unless she had news. I know she wanted to, she lives in a different country and misses us all the time. I come from a close family, and my gran looked after my brother and I while my parents worked. She loves us so much, and I wanted her to feel like she had a reason to message me each week (she has quiet days, and doesn't get busy too often.) 

So, I pretend to watch the same tv shows as her.  I will sometimes watch the occasional one so that we can chat about it. Basically, her messaging me each week to tell me what's on tv has given her something to start a conversation about when she's missing me - then we chat about other things. I so message her lots, but it's nice for her to feel she has something to message me about too. I've always told her to message me whenever she wants, but she knows I'm busy and I think she worries she will bug me. Alot has changed since then - she messages me all the time now!",wander-and-wonder,self.happy,1556313676

happy,"After 2 years, I’m free from my antidepressant!","Sorry, I’m not sure where to put this properly but I just need to get this off my chest to tell others! 

When I was in high school, My doctor gave me me venlafaxine HCL at a 75ml dose when I asked him to give me something because I felt like I was going to do something stupid. I was in a terrible mind state and in a terrible home environment.. I felt there was no escape from anything and I needed to do something before I snap. This was around 2 and a half years ago. I took this  medication and noticed it never helped my issues in the slightest. 

A year in I wanted nothing more than to get off them but the withdrawals were so painful I couldn’t go without them without painful migraines and drowsiness. 

2 years later I was feeling hopeless. I thought I would be taking this forever because of the withdrawals. Stupid thinking, but in my mindset I truly thought it would be me and this medication forever. I told my doctor I couldn’t do this anymore. I don’t know why my old doctor gave me such a high dose and that medication specifically..but thankfully this new doctor started to lower my dose to half. Then from there she told me when I was ready, I could go cold turkey. 

It took months. I had no time with my university schedule and was terrified of feeling the withdrawals so I waited. Finally after my last exam I promised myself I would start to change my life for the better. I haven’t touched them for 2 weeks..I felt minor drowsiness and confusion at times but overall I’m so proud of myself for doing this. 

I hope anyone going through the terrifying process of going off their antidepressants knows that it can happen and you’ll feel better knowing it will be out of your system. Sorry for the long post!",foreverlosingmymind,self.happy,1556294970
happy,Sometimes hard work actually does pay off!,"I've spent the last three and a half years in a fog of depression and self-loathing for a myriad of reasons few of which are particularly relevant here. It's culminated in 2019 being an absolutely miserable year, including three months of battling self-doubt and defeatism as I studied for the bar exam. Studying for the exam was miserable, but didn't even compare to what were undoubtedly the worst three days of my life, February 26-28, 2019.

Last night I didn't sleep, certain that I knew what lay ahead of me as the results were set to be published this morning I spent the night in a pessimistic echo chamber, thinking about how much money I've wasted trying to earn a license I'd never get, how all my time and effort is for naught, how I'd have been better served taking a menial job after college rather than go into law. I've wanted to be a public interest lawyer since I first read To Kill a Mockingbird (clichéd, I know) when I was 9 years old. As such I've been applying to the JAG corps of both the Navy and Air Force (they both only give you two chances to pass the exam if you want to be a JAG).

Certain as I was that I had performed poorly on the exam, I decided not to check the results until after I got off work this morning, and maybe not even until I got a letter from the state supreme court (yet forthcoming). But about an hour after my shift started (0645) one of my coworkers convinced me to get it over with. The thirty seconds it took for the results to load seemed like ages. Scrolling down I the list I found myself becoming progressively more nervous. Then I saw it, and it was like this enormous weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can't remember the last time I was this excited!

**Tavern (Dargath Chronicles #1)**

Xelnath of the Gnarled Root—a tavern owner, information broker, healer, and guildmaster of the Blackwind Company—has found a place, far better than the forest from which he came in the magical metropolis and city-state of Lladad in the Magiian Empire. 

When a simple act of kindness draws the ire of a troubled assassin, his love-stricken Archmage father and an army of magically constructed golems, Xel must scheme with vipers of the high court, mingle with royalty at the castle, blackmail drug dealers in the slums, and fight assassins and mercenaries in the streets.

He needs to lean on the support of his motley crew of a dark elf assassin, a dragon pirate, a high elf royal, and a talking dog artificer to keep him from his own inner demons and doubts.

He asked me if I was pregnant, most women would be offended but not me. Here's why, when I worked with him I was in a bad place mentally, physically, and emotionally. I was in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. I was raped multiple times during the duration of working there by a ""boyfriend"" who ""loved me."" I was working full time (30 or more hours) for the majority of my time there, along with going to school full time. I never got more than 5 hours of sleep because I had work, school, the abuse from the relationships, and an abusive home life. All of these things contributed to me not eating but once a day. When I ate it was more than a 110 pound teen should eat. (I was 17 for most of my time there.) And most of the time, when I ate was right before my sleep. So not only was I only sleeping very little I was moving, and being active the entire time I was awake, there for I could store none of the fat taccobell had to give, it would burn away. Now, I am in an amazing home life, an amazing relationship. I am applying for disability due to my PNES and PTSD so I can't work anymore. Yet I am at a healthy weight. I went from a tiny girl that constantly looked like she was starved or on drugs, to a woman who is mostly filled in (I'm still only 19) who is at a healthy weight. ( Around 160-170) and I am PROUD! I am amazed at how much I have grown and how much better I feel now that I am out of these relationships and out of those home situations. I graduated high school, and even though I'm no longer able to work, I am doing amazing. I'm happier, and healthier. ",goodsvibesandriptide,self.happy,1553570872

happy,The day I adopted my cats with an extra long header because apparently that's required," 

Ten  years ago I finally had a flat to myself again and, full of excitement,  I had a friend drive me to a local shelter to adopt me a cat. To be  specific, two cats. Indoor cats. Female. Indoor cats are a lot of hard  work (and no one likes to deal with litter trays) but my new flat was on  the junction of two very busy streets in a pretty grotty neighbourhood  so outdoor cats seemed irresponsible.

Anyway,  we pulled up at the shelter and I leapt out of the car like a demented  gazelle, giddy as a kid on christmas morning, and barely managed to wait  for my friend before charging inside. I explained what I was looking  for to the young lady inside and she took me to look at the cats that  were up for adoption. To my shock about half of the cats seemed to be  chocolate point siamese (several hundred pounds a pop so not what you  expect to find in a shelter).

The girl  explained that they had all been rescued from a mad old cat lady who was  keeping them all (20 ) in a one bedroom house and feeding them enough  for maybe 15 cats. They'd been in a real state when they were brought in  but they'd been fed up and were now full of beans. I was now, if  anything, even more excited at the prospect of adopting as the thought  of a pair of these magnificent kitties wandering around my flat was  really exciting to me so I wandered up the aisle, taking my time and  greeting each of the cats in turn, trying to not just yell ""ZOMG JACK  WANT ALL KITTIES!!! GIVE KITTIES TO JACK NOW!!

Cage  after cage was filled with these huge, beautiful and very, very vocal  cats, pressing themselves against the front of the cages for pettings  and I was totally confused, how would I ever choose. Until I got to the  last cage. There, my confusion ended.

In  this cage were, once again, two siamese cats. But these two were maybe  half the size of the others. And they weren't pressing against the front  of the cage looking for cuddles they were huddled at the back of the  cage, as far away from humans as they could get (I later found out that  they were also recovering from cat flu). The cat I would come to know as  Sif was huddled into the corner as tightly as she could squeeze  herself  and the warrior who would be Freya was lying half on top of  her, cuddling as close as she could and I knew. I just knew.

See,  those other cats, brimming with health and confidence? They could go  any where, be adopted by anyone but these two were going to need a  special home with someone patient and I was determined that I would give  them that home.

It's taken YEARS to  get them to act like proper, confident goddesses-of-all-they-survey  (y'know, cats) and they still get skittish around new people but Sif  will now walk up to people in my flat and Demand cuddles (remember,  siamese) and even Freya will allow people to pet her, though she has  some hilariously specific rules.

And  this brings me to the picture at the top of this post. Because you see,  beloved readers, those two terrified little cats. The cats I didn't even  see for the first two weeks that they lived with me because they were  hiding behind the fridge. Those two cats will now not only climb onto my  lap at any chance they get but, if I'm wearing a front opening top,  they will climb inside that top (with no regard at all for my tender,  easily punctured skin!) and they curl up and they purr and purr as if  they've finally found their happy spot. And some times this makes my  face leak, just a little bit.

And because I know the rules: Cat tax

happy,I'm so proud of myself and happy right now!,"Yesterday has been a day of victories. I struggle with social anxiety (which I'm in therapy for) and yesterday was one of those days where I totally kicked its ass. 

Me and my fiance went to see a concert last night (Soen, for those interested) and one of the things I really wanted, was the vinyl of the band's latest album. So, after the show I got the vinyl and I see the band hanging out in the lobby. I approached them all by myself (normally I'd have my fiance handle the social situations and I would awkwardly hide behind him) and had some nice conversations with them all and took some pictures with them. I was so nervous, it kinda glitched my ability to speak English properly (not my first language, although I speak it fluently). But it turned out fine! I went home with a brand new record with 5 autographs on it and some new favourite memories. 

I also approached the band that played support. Again, not my typical behaviour. Told them they played an awesome gig and talked to them a bit. 

This might not sound like anything exciting, but to me, this was HUGE. Despite the social anxiety, I absolutely love going to concerts. It's those events where I can forget about my struggles and just let go and enjoy. It usually doesn't involve me interacting with anything other than the music. Last night was different. I stepped out of my comfort zone (which was terrifying) and I am so damn proud at myself for doing so. And even now, the morning after, I can't stop smiling about it.

I had just enough money pay to pay the bills and buy groceries (Nothing healthy though) and nothing else. I was in this situation like this for about 5 years until finally this year, I hit a milestone!

A little something interesting about myself, I am a musician and I play piano, I do a lot of video game music. For a time, the income I got from my music was the only money I was receiving. I could barely afford rent and had to cut corners where I could.

I’m not sure what happened, or how, but my music must have gotten more popular because now I am making much more and can actually establish a savings!

In about 5 years of time, I went from barely supporting myself, to actually thinking about my future.  A house! I actually might be able to buy a house one day! I am engaged as well to the most amazing woman ever who completely supports my music and loves me for who I am.

Perspective is everything! I came across this in my daily affirmation reading and wanted to share.

It works for EVERYTHING! Try it, you don’t “have to “ go to the gym-you do “get to”; You don’t have to go to work, but you get to.

We don’t “have to” feel a certain way, we “get to” choose how we feel, and our feelings are directly connected to the thoughts that precede them. When we slow down enough to become aware of what our thoughts are, we choose the way we feel, which determines how we act, and brings the results that define our life.

happy,"After not being able to swim my entire life, I've swum an entire lane yesterday.","TL;DR: Couldn't swim for almost my whole life and panicked when I got in water that is too deep, overcame my fear and swam an entire lane in a pool that was 2,20m deep.

I am a 23 year old male and I've always been ashamed of myself for not being able to swim. My parents did put me in a swimming class when I was six years old, but before I was able to learn the basics, our family moved and money didn't allow them to get me into a swimming class again.

When swimming became a subject in PE, I was terrified because I was the only one in my class not able to swim. Therefore, I skipped these classes out of fear of being bullied, which in turn never helped me to finally learn how to swim. Whenever my parents or my big brother tried to teach me, I went into a panic and hyperventilated out of fear that I might drown if they leave me unattended. And so, the years came and went and I still wasn't able to swim. The mere thought of entering a body of water that was deeper than I was tall made my muscles cramp up.

A year ago or so, my big brother, who loves to swim, took me to the pool on a family trip. In the non-swimmer's pool, where I could safely stand in, he showed me the basics, taught me that panicking only make matters worse and was overall very patient with me. However, I still chickened out when he asked of me to go to the swimmer's pool.

After a rather bad exam yesterday, I had to unwind a bit. At a whim, I decided to go to the nearby indoor pool and just sit in the water for a bit to just have some time for myself. Since the pool was rather empty that day, I recalled the things my brother has taught me and swam a little bit in the non-swimmer's pool. I don't know how I got there, but suddenly I wanted to prove it to myself I could swim an entire lane (50m) in the swimmers pool. And I fucking did it. Granted, I wasn't the fastest and at the end it felt like my arms were falling off, but the second a panic thought threatened to arise, I concentrated myself on the end of the lane and kept going. When I started to realize I was in water where I couldn't stand in, I was too far inside the pool and just forced myself to keep going instead of giving up then and there.

I felt like I won the olympics when I got out of the pool. Swimming is something a lot of people take for granted, but to me, I overcame a fear I had with me for almost my whole life. And the best thing is: I had fun doing it. And I definitely want to keep going.

Thank you, big bro.",WolfL1nk,self.happy,1558782855

happy,Happy Birthday to Vietnam Vet Sung by Server!,"Hi! I'm M 16 and I work as a busser at a local hotel, and today I was tasked with being a server on a busy day when all of our available servers were taken. I have only been working at this hotel for about a month and I've never served a table in my entire life yet today we were in desperate need and I was able-bodied. After hours of hard, messy work — many orders messed up and some taking a long time to finish — I was pretty worn out. Ready to go home, tired and frankly, really depressed. After many complaints, these two polite people, one man and one woman, come in and take a seat at a booth I was covering. After some talking and my service (even though I was lackluster) they were stoked. I did my best and in the end, I learned the guy was turning 64 and was a retired Vietnam veteran. Having military interest, we talked about that with the woman (the man's cousin) and ended up in an in-depth conversation about politics and other science subjects. I got him a slice of cake with a candle, we sung Happy Birthday and I helped them book a movie ticket on their phones that they didn't know how to use. All-in-all, I was extremely happy after this incident, and I will never forget Phillip, the 64 year old African American Vietnam veteran.

Thank you and many others for your service! Such nice people. ❤️

happy,"I still can't believe how far my life has come, my dream is almost complete. If I can do it, anyone can. Sorry mobile user ( bad formatting sorry! )","My life, for 32 years, was a trainwreck. I was forced into sports by my father, a man who beat my mother weekly. The man who beat me so badly I was taken out the orange county ( Orlando FL ) public school systems and homeschooled. Why you ask? Oh, I firstly had trouble sitting from a beating I took and it was apparently time for me to focus on tennis anyway because I was going to be a profession. ( This was my fathers dream, for me to be his Hollywood kid. I had/have a nack for tennis I guess ) by 11 years old I was spending 7 to 8 hours a day either training off the court or practicing with my personal coach/ other hitting partners. I was running miles daily and calculated food intake was a must. I went to school at home. Mostly my mother filling things out and giving me the absolute minimums. I was getting decent at this tennis thing and welp i guess they chose to send me  away to tennis  ""academy"". It was horrifying, I'm 12 ish years old a top player in Florida, top 20 in my age group in the country. Living with kids 16/17 and 19 year olds from all over the globe. I go to school in a room alone. With a laptop and that's fucking it. I played tennis for 7 to 8 hours a day. Hitting the gym for 2 hours a day. Then finally going for a run for an hour before completing 2 hours of school. I played for years, different academy same story. I was top in the USA for a good portion of my youth and played numbers tournaments while traveling the country. I played a few professional tournaments as a minor and did pretty well . I had full ride offers to a fist full of schools and sponsors ready to talk money. All the while my mother's being beaten daily along with me. Losing was given public and private beatings ( loss at the tournament are seen as an embarrassment to my father). The beatings last so long, once he hit me in the head and face from Clearwater to Orlando in the car. He hit me so hard by surprise I couldn't block any of it that I swear my one eyes bigger because the other one never opened correctly again after the swelling went down. I once had full body craps to which he punched me for swearing in pain begging for salt pills and a fucking doctor. He broke his phone on my nose once, the kicker was I didn't lose... I simply didn't win by enough. This is a small sample of my horrifying run with tennis and so I digress. By 17 I put the racket down and the my father explained I was no longer his son. By 17 I wasn't small anymore. My father who was  still just as aggressive had less of an edge over me but I still haven't made any pushback during my beatings  I started smoking weed at 15. No big deal ( I never stopped :) ) I had met a girl on plane who exchanged emails with me. We chatted for a bit and started talking on the phone, long story short I said fuck it, packed s bag and said I want to leave. Spoke to my mother then my father. We had a nice little fist fight and I got a plane ticket out their life. Fast forward a bit and I'm now living in Jersey with a chick 6 years older than me. That relationship fizzled and I'm back in Vegas living in a bathroom stall in an apartment complex pool. I'm walking down the road and who the fuck do I see... Andre and Diane ( my parents ) ( my parents moved to Vegas from Florida while I was up north ). They force me in the car and off I go home to live again. I'm forced to work with him in timeshare ( LPT: that shits for selling not buying. Never ever buy one. EVER ) he was head of sales department so yup I was selling that garbage. I meet another chick. She was in timeshare so I should have know she was nuts lol. We live together and she's super crazy. I'm honestly not badmouthing her, seriously fucking bonkers. Nonetheless. I get a call that my father is going to South Africa ( we are from South Africa ...I know user name checks out  ) he's going with some friends I had from early childhood. So I say why not, pack a bag and go with. We go, have an amazing time. Had no clue, my wife would be on that trip with me. No clue that my life changed with that trip. The trip started with two people who both had relationships outside the trip and turned into two people going home to pack their items and meet the other to start their new life together. I continued to struggle with my childhood, internally I was a mess. My fathers manipulative behavior continued to draw me in. Empty promises and straight lies. His abusive behavior stopped with his hands and intensifies on an emotional and social level. He hated my newfound relationship and tried to chip away at it any chance he got. I'd need 100 pages to go into all the shit the man has done. I ate my feelings and weighted in over 285 pounds. I flinched at fast hand movements. Even from my children. I was depressed snd had plans to commit suicide. I had a rocky relationship with my wife. I sucked as a personal. I was violent ( never to my now wife and kids ). In general I was aggressive I guess. I manipulated everyone to get what I wanted. I cheated on my wife regularly. I lied for fun and had become numb to causing pain to others. I had contact with my ""family"" still at this stage. I was using harder drugs, I was never not high. I was never not xanny barred out. Never without 5 to 10 Roxy I my pocket. Fucked up daily. I was walking garbage. Couldn't hold down a job to save my life. I was human waste. 

One year ago, I chose to cut anyone in my family totally out. I've not had contact with anyone I moved 1500 miles away. I cleaned up my fucked up habbits. I still smoke. Everyday. Nothing else lol. I got a job making 70+ a year. We bought a new carfor the first time as a family. I married my dream girl. The one who stuck by me. We have 4 kids and I'm finally not too mentally fucked to be with and have it mean something to me. I love my fucking life. I love in a house on 4 acres. I have a freaking pool. I love my kids so damn much I cry just thinking about. I'm so happy. I'm so happy I found you Janine. Our kids are beautiful and I fucking love you. I'm so damn happy. 

PS Andre and Diane I don't hate you anymore. You suck as parents. I feel horrible for my siblings. I miss my brother horribly. However my life is so amazing without you. You are all a cancer. Cutting you out has me cancer free. No more will I worry that you can grow back.",whiteandafrikan,self.happy,1571991692

happy,I'm glad Alex Morgan's unborn child is a girl,"I don't care how much hate I get for this. I believe that Alex Morgan's child being a girl is a good thing for women's rights, as crazy as it may sound, specifically in sports. Here's why.

As most of you know women are extremely underpaid in sports, like soccer (football), basketball, etc. Now, here's the thing about genetics, that child will most likely, in the very least, have an above average ability in athletics. At the most, a world class athlete who could go down as the greatest of all time. This is what the world needs. Another empowering female figure who can dominate in sports and further prove that they deserve more money and rights in sports. I'm not hating on males, please don't take it that way. 

I'm just saying that in her particular situation, having a girl will benefit women's rights in the best way possible because of the odds of her having a supreme athletic ability, that may necessarily be pointless if she had a boy. Heck, I wouldn't mind if the rest of her children, if she has anymore, are girls because that could mean even more to our fight. Just think about a trio of sisters on the best team in the world promoting equal rights, nothing would stop them. And that is my take on this.

happy,I felt real happiness last night for the first time in many months.,"I feel like a cloud has lifted. I've had serious mental health problems for many years but the last few months have been worse than anything, after the sudden death of my little brother. I've been feeling emptiness, dread, fear and pain at all times, and it nearly killed me. I forgot what positive feelings are like.

Last night I finished up a rehearsal and was heading back to the car when I realised I felt good. Joyful even. It was such a surprise that I laughed out loud. I also felt like I had some mental clarity back after being under a heavy cloud. Today I've been physically quite anxious but I'm able to acknowledge the anxious sensations without feeling despair or panic.

I've changed my medications recently and I think it's made a big difference, though I also think there's something more to it than just the drugs. I'm being careful to watch myself in case there's any chance that this is some kind of mania, but I've never been manic before and I don't think it is. I think I'm just genuinely feeling ok.

Incoming problem - Wrong train. So she's never gonna make her flight, doesn't know where she is or where she's going. Random woman on train lets her use her phone to call me, explains the situation.

Ten minutes later I get a message from the woman explaining who she is and that she put Emma into a cab and sent her the airport to make her flight. Emma makes the plane just as the gate is closing and is now home.

She tells me it was an Uber and the woman even paid for it, this random woman who we've never met. I offered to refund her the cash and she refused, insisting instead I just pass the good deed forward.

I always try to be a good guy but knowing there are people willing to go above and beyond like this is amazing. I'm pretty high on life right now and it makes me feel so happy to know there are people out there that just wanna help others.

I was so wrong. I didn’t think I’d ever find someone else I’d want to give my heart to after my divorce but when I stopped looking for someone to love me and learned to love myself he showed up and stole my heart. It’s been so long since I’ve wanted to share my heart with someone and to be honest I’d become very jaded and cynical. That’s all changing now though because knowing that I’m loved and cherished so deeply is breaking down the walls that I’d spent the last several years building.

happy,TL;DR I became an aunt and felt happy tears for the first time in a while,"  

Hi there!

**Background information:** I used to always cry easily, about happy and sad things. A year ago I stopped taking the contraceptive pill and had an IUD inserted. In the last couple weeks I realised that I hardly cried in the past year. My mood swings and unstable emotions were probably caused by the contraceptive pill. It felt good to be more in control of my emotions, but also made me a bit sad, as having a good cry can help letting go of emotions.

**Current situation:** Recently I was dating this guy, but it didn’t work out, so that was a bit meh. I’m also working on graduating and writing my thesis. This makes me feel quite stressed, with the deadline coming up on Friday. Yesterday I handed in my first complete draft of my thesis, it felt like a weight was lifted from my shoulders. An hour later my mum called me to let me know that my brother had his first born and for the first time in a year I felt happy tears! 

My brother and his fiancé had a baby boy and they chose a lovely name that works in all three languages that they intend to raise him in (SIL is foreign). This baby boy makes me an aunt and that makes me soooooo very happy! He is so precious and tiny and I love him so much and I can’t wait to meet him later this week!

I get severe depressive moods and issues with mental illness (a cocktail of Pure OCD, ADHD and BPD, while also finally getting to grips with my agoraphobia and panic disorder). I had a late start to university as due to my previously mentioned health issues I had to repeat my last year of high school three times until I passed. 

Due to these reasons, I was barely in class this year and I put in a minimal amount of energy into my classes (just enough to pass). I averaged a B+ over the entire course despite not studying, attending class or doing homework. Honestly, it got so bad that I didn't shower for 3 months and I didn't leave my dorm for the entire time. Sorry TMI. 

Despite this all, I managed to meet the requirement to study abroad in any of the schools they offer overseas, even the ones with the highest requirements. A teacher also had a serious discussion with me and told me that if I \*really\* tried I could be a 4.0 student.

Last Wednesday night I couldn’t sleep. I was pacing and panicking and really thinking of giving up. I realized somehow I guess, in a moment of clarity that all the people saying I need help were probably right.  I googled “mental hospital near me” and called the number at the first link. 

It was terrifying for me and I’d put it off for years literally. But I called them, had a long talk, and then drove myself over. 

I won’t go into detail about while I was there (but feel free to pm me) but I just discharged yesterday.  
And oh my god. The difference is insane. I cleaned up where I live, set up multiple goals with a professional who was trained for this type of thing. And I feel different. There’s this warmth in my chest. I want to do things for the first time in years it’s so mad I can hardly believe it.

happy,"After years of trying, I got my first deer this weekend!","I moved over to the US when I was 27, and everyone I met while I was settling down had been hunting for twenty years at that point in their lives. My wife is from here, but her family never hunted. I wanted to, but it took some years before I was able to start really learning and pursuing it.

One of the things that appealed to me when we were talking about moving here was that self-sustaining lifestyle that we could work to achieve - growing our fruits and veggies, raising small livestock and hunting and fishing for the majority of our meat.

Not a lot of people wanted to take a 30-year-old newbie out to their spots though, so for the last three years I’ve been researching and learning; building up all the theory I could, and picking the brains of every hunter who’d give me a minute. After that, it was all trial-and-error in the field!

On Saturday, after so many mornings without even a sight of a deer, I lay down and scoped out a field that my coworker owns. I lay there for two hours in 28° frost, and - for the first time - watched a deer come into range and present a clean shot. Years of theory flooded through my mind as I went through the motions from start to finish, downing the 6-point buck, and bringing in a few dozen pounds of healthy, clean meat for my family of seven.

I took it to a processor this time, but I’ll learn to do it all myself soon. I saved a small cut that I cooked up with some eggs from my chickens, and ate the most satisfying meal I’ve had for a while that night.

happy,Learning this Simple Concept made me happier than I've ever thought I would be,"This is an excerpt from my personal journal, any time I feel lost or discouraged I consitently find myself coming back to it. Reading these words inevitably fill me with motivation and clarity on what's the reasonable next step to take, hopefully this can help many other fellow humans to experience more fulfilment and happiness in their own lives. 

Here's the main concept:

Lasting Happiness (fulfilment) can only happen through a Holistic System of Good Habits.

And these are my personal reflections about that:



Habits are the Success Tool of Nature...

Inconsistency leaves no room for long term Successful Outcomes, if there wasn't a consistent component to Evolutionary Natural Selection it would not be possible to successfully carry a species through hundreds of thousands of years. And since humans are a byproduct of Nature's systems it appears self-evident to me that the same principle applies in relation to Successful Outcomes of human endeavors.

Good Habits = Consistent Successful Progress (CSP)

CSP = Happiness*

I shouldn't simply ask myself why I'm not consistently happy (or at least content), the real important question is:

What crucial Good Habits (both mental &amp; physical) am I lacking? 

Of course a context of well-being for myself and others it's implied, and I clearly can't include any form of addiction in that context. Although they can feel so good to to the point of fooling my mind into rationalizing even obviously destructive Habits in a well-being context).

Even a slightly approximately correct answer to that question can save me from a whole life of unnecessarily added misery and struggle, so it's probably wise to spend some real good time thinking about it.


And to quote a consistently wiser dude than me:

“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”

(Aristotle)

And here's another quote if I need some extra motivation:

""It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier.
But you gotta do it every day, that's the hard part.
But it does get easier.""

(Bojack Horseman)

*

Of course it's crucial to be aware that some degree of tragedy and pain are a virtual inevitability of the human condition, so I'm not in any way implying that Good Habits will solve all of my problems (although they can and will make my problems significantly more tolerable). There are obviously many things that I can't directly control, and in many of those instances it's clearly not useful to think in mainstream terms of mere success but more in terms of successful acceptance and emotional healing.

I'm just saying that, if really I REALLY want the best possible life I get, having the best possible Habits it's probably your my bet.

To that many people could say:

Well no sh*t Sherlock, how is that revolutionary news?

And my answer is:

Just look around...

And honestly count how many people truly dedicate most (or even a small chunk) of their daily time to the understanding and development of the best possible Habits they can get. It will inevitably be an extremely marginal percentage of people, and it shouldn't come as a shock that virtually all of those people are among the most successful humans to ever walk the face of the Earth.

So now stop complaining like a little b*tch that's upset cuz daddy won't pay for the new Justin Bieber album she wants, and get your lazy Netflix-lover a$s back in the game by taking the very best next step you can take with what you got. Even a daily 1% improvement can completely change your life in a few months, can you even imagine that version of you in a few years?

happy,Bed sheets,"I had to learn bed sizes. The past few years I've gotten a 'new' (read: gently used) bed when friends or family got a new bed and got rid of their old one. They'd give me the bed and sheets to fit and I'd thank them, because I was grateful to not sleep on the floor. 

Recently I went shopping for the first time, because I got a NEW bed, and my (much) better financial status meant I could get NEW sheets. I'm grateful to all the help I've gotten, but getting to pick my own stuff was incredible. It also meant I needed to know the size of my bed, and 'bigger than me' didn't help as much as I thought it would. 

So many thanks to both the people who gave me these things in the past, and my mother and aunt who went to Walmart and followed me around for an hour while I asked them if they liked these sheets or those sheets better and explained which ones I liked. I ended up leaving with three sets and a new pillow to complete the day. It made me feel like a whole new person to cover my surroundings with things I picked out.

Tonight, I just watched a Sylveon Trolls video on Gen 8 because fuck it, Sylveon Trolls is always going to be good. I learned that Pokémon Sword/Shield really is as bad as they say it is, and I laughed. Looking at all the gen one favoritism from an ex-fan's perspective really made me laugh. That video gave me the closure I needed, and for the first time, I'm not bitter about this issue.

Today I realised I am living my dream thanks to this push: I’m doing a PhD and starting a career I always wanted, my family are well and happy and my SO is a wonderful person who makes me so happy by allowing me to be 100% authentic, and shows my that side of himself in return.

happy,I’ve hit the three month mark with strength training. I’m in the best shape of my young life.,"20M, 6’0”, 172lbs (183cm, 78kg if you’re a Canadian).

Today, I am now starting on week thirteen of my strength training program, and I have completed three months of the program. I have seen many positive results, and achievements, even over this short span of time. The lift records listed below were achieved with 5 sets of 5 reps, except for the deadlift, which had 1 set of 5 reps.

Deadlift: 95lbs (43kg) -&gt; 265lbs (120kg)
Back squat: 45lbs (20kg) -&gt; 225lbs (102kg)
Bench press: 45lbs (20kg) -&gt; 125lbs (56.7kg)

I made sure to eat well, too, with plenty of meat and eggs and protein sources, and get good sleep. You can see that even on the bench press, which uses the smallest muscles of the three, that I more than doubled the amount of weight I could sustain.

Furthermore, my weight changed, from 163lbs (74kg) to 172lbs (78kg). My musculature has also become much more developed, and I now feel like I can take my shirt off and be confident in the way that I look, too. My posture is much straighter and more upright, even with everyday tasks such as walking or sitting in chairs or carrying a backpack. I can now haul multiple heavy bags of groceries in both hands, from the bus stop back to my apartment, with no problem whatsoever. 

I look good, I feel good, and so far, I’m happy at the transformation I’ve been able to achieve in such a short time. I see no reason to stop now!",swordofdamocles19,self.happy,1563947583

Fun fact: It was. Fast forward to today and the same girl is now happier and healthier!

I adopted a dog who I love dearly and it will be one year with her on Sunday. She keeps me active 3x a day since I don't have a yard and have to take her out to go potty daily. I am now in a very secure and loving relationship with a guy who values my time, appreciates my efforts, and is super thoughtful. I will have spent almost a year's time with this amazing guy in February.

Previously my mother and I had been negotiating how to handle the car note; they were doing me a favor and “car sitting” for me, but it also helped my parents out because they preferred having a second car to get around with.

It’s absolutely nuts because my Mom had just been rear ended a month ago!!!! So I was actually a little scared about her driving my car anyway... she’s getting older and I don’t want anything to happen to her.

I’m glad everyone is okay. But damn, it’s going to be awesome closing this chapter of my life out. It was the third car I’ve ever owned and I will miss it.

happy,Today is the first day in years that I‘ve been at home that I haven’t touched videogames and it’s all due to selfmedication with LSD,"Today is the first day in years that I‘ve been at home and haven’t played any videogame and it’s thanks to selfmedicating with LSD.

Well basically I‘ve been dealing with social media and videogame addiction in combination with severe social anxiety and depression for years, leading me to drop out of Highschool and basically becoming a NEET for years. I was never in therapy because it was simply impossible to find a therapist that I clicked with and that would actually take me as a patient, not even as a private one.
So at the end of 2018 then I discovered what now seems to be some sort of savior for me. LSD.
At first I just tried it out with a couple of friends and had some good and some absolutely horrifying experiences leading to me actually being hospitalized due to a psychotic Episode.
That’s the point when every smart person would have stopped.
But I was not that person. And it actually ended up paying off.
First thing I did is I started exclusively doing low doses by myself. Then after one trip I simply decided to never drink alcohol again. While I haven’t completely fulfilled that promise and even though I was never a heavy drinker in the first place, I ended up severely reducing my alcohol consumption.
Last Fall I then had a trip where I simply felt happy. It had been a long time since I had felt that way and for the first time it actually gave me hope that things could get better. Fast forward to this day. Basically I was alone the whole day, tasked by my parents to cook some food. Now normally I probably would have just warmed up some noodles and gone to spend the rest of the day on playing video games in my room. Instead I dropped my last half Tab, ended up taking 3 hours to cook a delicious curry, take a walk outside even though it’s quite cold and spend the rest of the day trying to teach myself to play the guitar in the garden.
Now it’s 7:30pm. I have not started any video game the entire day, which is something that during the last couple of years only has happened when I was on vacation. I feel like I finally experienced a taste of what it‘s like to be mentally healthy for the first time in ages and managed to break out of incredibly toxic patterns of behavior that I had not managed to get under control before.

Two lessons were learned from this.

1. Don’t underestimate how useful LSD can be therapeutically to break vicious patterns of behavior and defeat addiction. It’s criminally stupid that this substance is illegal and as stigmatized as it is and I recommend it to everybody that’s currently struggling with addiction. (Seriously, be careful though and inform yourself about it first though. Read. Tons. You don’t wanna make the initial mistakes I did).

2. I‘m just so proud right now I can’t describe it. I finally feel hopeful for my future instead of seeing myself as some sort of failure that strict parenting and being bullied in school had led me to see myself as. I just wanted to share my story and spread some of the joy I‘m feeling.",AnAngryYordle,self.happy,1579806937
happy,After many years of trying to find myself as a writer I finally published my first book,"I've loved writing ever since I was in high school. In college I studied journalism but found that it wasn't quite for me. I graduated six years ago with a journalism degree and sort of moved away from writing as a whole. I just didn't enjoy how restrictive the journalism field was for me.


Last year I finally accepted that my writing skills were more on the creative side than the informative side and I finally got started on writing a book. It was a fun process and it really allowed me to enjoy writing in my own way and style. Creative writing is definitely more for me.


I finally had my book released on Amazon yesterday and, though far from perfect, I'm still proud of it. It's a humorous book titled [Nobody Cares About Your Fantasy Team.](https://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Cares-About-Your-Fantasy/dp/B083XVLQDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pl_foot_top?ie=UTF8) At least I found it pretty funny.

He's passed away now and I never had a relationship with him. I grew up with my bio mom's side of the family because of that, so I had a different last name than everybody else. I always felt confused with my identity to have that last name. 

I was adopted by my grandparents, I called them mom and dad. They raised me as their own child. My bio mom was still in the picture, but she had a lot of drug issues and was never a good mom to me. 

My dad was my whole life. We had a bond deeper than you could ever imagine. One that transcends normal human bonds. He passed away on Thanksgiving a few years ago.

Well, I decided that to honor his memory and feel a connection to him, I would legally change my name to match his. It's been a pain, but the paperwork finally came through today! I am officially sharing the same last name as my father, and I've never felt so happy in a long time! My first name actually means ""father's joy"", too, so my whole name is honoring him!!

happy,"My dreams are coming true! Life may be hard, but it can be wonderful too! (long)","I am not a person who likes to brag so most of the time I’ve always been very low key about my accomplishments. In fact, I have always been self-deprecating so that others will be more accepting of me. This is a habit I’ve been actively trying to stop because I shouldn’t have to downplay my success in order to be liked. But the fact is I don’t really have friends or much family to share with, and the friends and family I do have seem to not enjoy my successes with me. I thought maybe I could share it with you fine people. I’ve heard of how awesome this community can be and even though I’m scared of getting even more negativity thrown at me I’m going to do it anyway. Fear is a part of living right? 
So both my husband and I come from very humble beginnings. He grew up in a trailer park with young and inexperienced but loving parents who taught him the value of hard work but had no experience with money. I grew up moving a lot between states with parents that should have had money due to good career choices but were always struggling due to poor decision making. I was also subjected to sexual abuse from the time I was born until I was 14 from my grandfather and received little positive affection during my developmental years. 
That being said, when I met my husband my first dream came true. We met and married young. I was fresh out of high school and he was a senior in high school. A lot of people out there believe that if they are in a committed relationship too early, they will miss out on a lot of things life has to offer. And while that may be true for them, it hasn’t been for us. We’ve grown into adults together, experienced wild and crazy things together, have had sexual adventures together, traveled together, failed and learned together. No topic has ever been off-limits and no experience is off the table with us. We also never had children and neither of us ever wanted them. After being married for 19 years and having only one major fight in our first few years of marriage I can say that I believe we are soul mates. I know a lot of people don’t think they exist, but we do… we’re just extremely rare. I think the larger the population gets the rarer we become. 
Anyway, we set life goals together early on. Neither one of us was used to having any kind of money growing up. And having nice things were few and far between. We didn’t really have any huge life dreams we wanted to achieve. I honestly just wanted to be loved and to be safe and to have a home. Maybe… if I were to dream big… that home would have a pool. Maybe even an inground pool! 
So, we set up our plans and thankfully my husband was born with this ability to manage money as he certainly wasn’t taught how to. Over the years he’s taught me so much about how to handle finances and has helped his family learn and achieve as well. His instincts were always spot on and instead of planning out some huge dream scenario we paid attention to the opportunities that would come our way and together discussed whether to take them or pass on them.
Over the years we put on some weight and I began to develop some health issues which put a strain on things, but never to the point I was ever worried about our happiness. Thanks to my husband and his researching skills he found the Keto diet and I’ve lost 20 lbs already and am working on my last 20 now. I feel amazing and have more energy and confidence in myself than I ever have before. He also has lost 20 lbs and looks fantastic. He always carried his weight well and was never fat like I think I was but together we’re now living our best life. We are more active and capable. After all this time together he’s still the only man I fantasize about and want to be with and I’m thankful daily to have him in my life. 
 He ended up purchasing an existing business from a man who was ready to retire and a year after that another business associate wanted to retire so he bought that business and merged them together. I ended up quitting my job (receptionist work so nothing I went to school for or honestly cared too much for) and joined him at the business. And so my second dream become a reality! Now we operate it together and I have found that not only do I enjoy it, I’m really good at it too! I wake up in the morning and for the first time in my life, I don’t dread going to work. I don’t lay there and wonder if I could play hooky without getting fired or in trouble. And I have discovered that all the people I had worked with and bosses that I had over the years that tested me in some way shape or form have in fact taught me a valuable skill that I utilize in the operation of this business. Everything ended up meaning something.
During all the time that we were building up to the business dream we bought and sold our first home at a profit, just skating in under the wire of the 2008 housing crisis. We continuously lived as far below our means as we were comfortable with, and without children, we were able to save a lot and invest it wisely. I can honestly say that we are both very lucky people, but we also worked very very hard to achieve our goals. We didn’t just let life happen to us. We planned it, we worked at it and we never stopped trying to go forward. We earned this life that we made and I am so excited!
This year is the year we are going to build our dream house! With a pool! Maybe even an inground pool! We’ve picked the plans and are choosing our builder and looking for the date to break ground. Our next dream is really going to come true and I am so excited I can hardly stand myself! 
Thank you for reading! I feel like I’ve been busting at the seams with happiness and wanted to share with someone! Anytime I’ve tried to share my joy with those physically in my life I’ve been met with silence or they change the subject back to them. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I cannot share the good or the bad with anyone. I wish all of you could feel what I feel and that your lives are filled with joy and happiness as well!",smileycat,self.happy,1579717652

happy,I’m getting laid off at my job this week but everything is going to be ok because my spouse is a wonderful partner.,"Back story. When I was a kid both of my parents were pretty severe alcoholics the ended getting divorced and stayed alcoholics for a very long time. It was hard. I took care of my younger sister a lot, we went to soup kitchens a lot, it sucked. I’m not mad at my parents or anything, I’ve dealt with those feelings and at least understand why they were like that. But I had gotten so used to taking care of myself and others because that’s pretty much all I knew. I was dumb and married a guy who basically wanted a mom forever. I worked, he stayed home and did nothing. I cleaned the house, grocery shopped, cooked, managed the bills and whatever else. After realizing that he was not going to change and I deserve better I ended our relationship. For the next few years it was me handling everything in my life and that’s fine. 

After my spouse and I had been together for awhile he relocated to where I lived and it took a few months to find a job. He managed the house in the meantime so that was nice. He got his dream job and everything has been great. 

Now I’m getting laid off. Unemployment isn’t nearly as much I make at my job and there’s no time frame for when the lay off will end. I feel like I have to jump into action and get this handled by myself ASAP because that’s what I’ve always done out of necessity. Finding a job that pays well enough in the industry that is doing the lay offs is not an easy task so I’m panicking. I’m not going to make enough money. I’m so fucked. 

Cue the good spouse. I’m venting to him about my panic and he nonchalantly tells me “don’t sweat it. We’ll get through this just fine. Together.” And he means it. He’s ok with picking up my slack because that’s what partners do. It feels so good (and so foreign) to actually have someone I can rely on. Someone who can and will actually help and will help. For the first time in so long I feel like I’m not handling life alone and it’s comforting.",yellingsnowloaf,self.happy,1579714379

He asked if I had insurance, which I don't, then asked some more that warranted telling him that I'm broke and literally just moved away from my husband. Fastward to the discharge and the nurse walks in hands me money and says the doctor wanted me to have it to help with the medication and nebulizer.

I’ve finally reached that level of adulting where I realize I’m an adult and it doesn’t absolutely terrify me. I finally landed the dream of a 9-5 job, and—bonus—it comes with some pretty great coworkers. I’m making enough money that I can see the light at the end of my debt tunnel (it’s definitely a tiny LED light but I can see it). And because my schedule is actually consistent, I can make time to a) swim (yay for exercise!), b) see my friends (yay for socializing!), and c) have time for myself and my cats (yay for self-care!)

A year ago I never would have thought I would be where I am today, and the fact that I am is pretty awesome. It really puts life in perspective. I know there are millions of other 26 year olds who are way ahead of me, but in my timeline I’m exactly where I need to be and I’m glad I finally figured that out.

happy,I am starting a new chapter of my life in the coming weeks and I couldn’t be more thrilled.,"I have had a rough go at life for the past seven years. My relationship was incredibly challenging and exhausting. My job was stagnant. I was so tired. This winter in the depths of my frustration and depression, I chose to start making little positive changes for my own happiness every day. I told my SO I would no longer allow myself to be undervalued, spoken to in a disrespectful manner, or belittled. I asked him to move out. I put more pictures up of my family and other people I love. I tackled more home projects and set off on more adventures with my kids. I started getting out of bed earlier and going to bed at a decent time. I  read more books, with and without my kids. I applied for a job I’ve wanted for years just to see where it went. I (just now) finished my final assignments for my fifth class this year after ten months of busting my butt in school.

Here’s what happened:

My SO moved out, realized what he lost and got the help he needed to love himself first. Since then, we’ve come full circle, he’s moved back in and my relationship has evolved in ways I’d never imagined. I’ve been in school for my Bachelor’s degree for what seems like an eternity and I can finally see the light at the end as I graduate in June 2020. That job I applied for? I got it! My last day at my current job (12 years) is this Thursday. I start my new job July 8th after a much needed week off and a vacation with my family. 

Reddit was a big part of getting me through all of this crap even though none of you knew that. You all carried me when I was sad and lonely and trying to push through all those hard days and nights. So much so that I wish I could do the free jellybean trick that I used to do in Toontown and give everyone reddit gold just from reading my post but:   

1. reddit isn’t Toontown.

happy,All I had was hatred but as I've grown and evolved into the woman I am. I love you dad. ❤️,"From the day I was born my parents never had a good relationship, he physically, mentally, verbally, emotionally, financially, sexually abused my mom. He abused me as well, physical, verbal, mental, and  emotinal abuse. Mom stayed on saying it was for me. She didn't have to cause from the age of three I asked her to leave him. I always told her I hated him. They've been fighting for a divorce for the past 8 years. The courts back home are stupid and don't like giving people divorces. 

A day or so ago I got some pictures of him and his new girlfriend. Looking at those pictures I saw my dad smile and be happy. I'm older now and I understand. I always had hatered for him in my heart for what he did to my mom and I. But now that I'm older I don't think those are the right emotions to carry. I'm not saying what he did to my mother and I was right it was wrong he should have never abused my mom and I to the extent he did. But now that my dad has had time to grown and live life more I'm sure he's not the same. He lost out on having a family, having a daughter, having a loving wife, and a home, he's had enough loses. He deserves happiness. I have no contact with him (don't plan on contacting him, but you never know that might change.) But from the bottom of my heart, I am so glad he got out there. As long as he is happy and as long as he treats her right and doesn't go back to his old ways I am very happy for him. He deserves the happiness. Now at least. He's been thru hell and back. My mom wasn't the easiest at times. So he's entitled to happiness. I just hope she treats him right as well. He deserves to have a better half that gets him. I do love him, he is my father after all and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be here. I am his daughter.

happy,"After years of searching, I finally found a copy of my stepfathers mug"," My stepfather and I aren’t close in the way where we can talk about everything, but he has always supported me and been one of my biggest role models. I remember he had this mug that was his favourite and used it every day for tea or coffee. It had this silly drawing on it with an old man trying to make a cup of coffee, but there is a woman yelling at him and disturbing him. It had the message: This is daddy’s “Coffee-doctor-mug” (Daddy pours, but mommy says stop!).

I remember always finding it very special and after years in use (and in the dish washer) both the text and picture had faded away. I remembered the mug in 2014 when my stepfather had his 75th birthday celebration, but I couldn’t find a copy of it (I only had the memory of it, no picture, which made the search more difficult). I continued looking for it in second-hand shops and such, but I ended up loosing all hope.

Last year I found a mug with similar drawings and began my search again. I posted in a large FB group a description of the mug and managed to get a picture of it (They wouldn’t sell it to me though). I posted the picture onto several FB sale groups, but no response. I repeated it again a few months later, no response again.

This weekend I decided on one last attempt, because my stepfathers 80th birthday celebration is in 2 weeks. I got a huge response and just a few hours later someone living close to me said they had one in good condition and I could have it for free!

Before, I never actively tried searching for a job, just looked and dreamed. I was in a relationship with someone who didn’t want to live out that way but rather stay in the Midwest and we compromised. Last May we broke things off and I hit the ground running focusing on myself. I still didn’t look for new jobs, but I focused on my current job, tried new hobbies and old hobbies. Spent time with family and friends I didn’t get to see often. 

Until recently, I received a job offer from a company in AZ - better salary, benefits, and overall job quality. Not that my job is bad, I love what I do and who I work with. But this is my ticket to AZ and I’m taking it. 

This will be the fresh start I’ve needed, being with family and being offered a great job opportunity. It gives me the chance to explore a part of the country that I love so much and always have felt a pull towards.

happy,"A couple years, this boy invited my son to his birthday party, which was on a Saturday.","Well, Friday, my kid broke his arm and we couldn't get in to see the ortho until Monday, so he was basically on in a sling and on bed rest all weekend as to not further aggravate the injury.  I texted this kids mom Friday night and let her know my son couldn't come to the party, and she dropped that this boy only invited my son-- the birthday boy is autistic, and even though he's a really great kid (I even like hanging out with him!) I guess most of the classmates treat him like crap.  So, we ended up changing the plans that this boy could come over to my house, we rented a few movies, got pizza delivered, etc.  So, this kid's birthday party ended up being the two of them hanging out on my couch playing minecraft and watching TV.

happy,I got hugs from my favourite teacher ever. Best day of my life!,"I'm in my senior year and it's finals month. I had my first exam yesterday. It was psychology and it went pretty good. Anyways, I was taught by (Let's call her Ms. G) for a year and a half. And believe me when I tell you she has been the nicest teacher I have ever had or heard of my entire life. She was a good teacher and she never bossed around. All of us felt really comfortable around her. When me and my best friend had a rough split, she knew something was wrong and decided to ask me how I was. I told her everything and she gave me some good advice. She understood me and how emotionally unstable I was this year so she constantly asked me how I was feeling. She was the kindest person I had ever met. 
Fast forward to yesterday, I was extremely stressed out so I asked her for a hug. She was like.. Ofcourse! I went in for it and she gave me the best hug I have ever had for atleast a couple of months now. There was something just so motherly and warm about it I felt like I was going to cry. Now you may think I'm exaggerating but let me tell you that my mom and I had this terrible incident two years ago and we haven't hugged her or lied on her lap since then. I don't intend to either. I don't really have any friends either. So this was my first hug in months. And it was nothing short of magical. I ended up getting 3 hugs from her, each tighter than the last. I felt the same kind of joy I used to get when my mom would to hug me. God I wish Ms. G was my mom!",Laninaconfusa,self.happy,1582472569

happy,Finally have some good people in my life,"Okay so the backstory for this is pretty long, sorry about that, I have ADHD so I get pretty rambly sometimes.

So like I just said, I have ADHD, and I also have a few other mental disorders that can be really challenging sometimes, so my school offers something called an IEP (I honestly don’t know if I ever learned what it stands for, and if I did, I don’t remember) for those students, which basically gives them extra help, like giving them more time on tests.

So I have an IEP, and students with an IEP are able to go to a “special” study hall (or are forced to, in my case), where it’s basically study except there’s less students and more teachers and they’re always making sure you’re doing work and help students more.

This “special study hall” has a name, but because it’s specific to my school, I don’t really want to share it. Anyway, these SSHs (that’s what I’ll call them from now on) are all over the school, and include students from all grades, and I’ve made a lot of friends with the other people in my SSH, and there’s even a group chat among most of us in our SSH.

Okay, sorry for that backstory, it was way too long. Can you tell it’s 2:30 AM here? Anyway.

So ~a week ago I walk in to this SSH and one of the TAs (there are 3 TAs there) jokingly says “Oh no, it’s [my name],” and my friend responde with “No, it’s the opposite,” and it made me feel really good.

I have anxiety, so I constantly feel like I’m saying/doing the wrong thing and that my friends don’t like me, but hearing him say something like that really warms my cold and shriveled heart.

It just makes me really happy to know my friends (or at least that one friend) feel the same way about me as I do about them.

My life hasn’t been particularly easy or fun, but this year I think I’m learning from my past mistakes, becoming a better person, and finally starting to get over my depression, and knowing that I have people like that by my side really helps me through my daily struggle.

I applaud you for getting to the end of this, and hopefully everyone reading is/will be as blessed as I am, or even more so.",Spudblood,self.happy,1582444067

happy,My landlords who went missing last week have been found alive by search and rescue crews!!!,"Last week, my landlords asked me to look after their cat while they went on a short trip to a local national park. They said they would be back by Saturday afternoon, but come Sunday evening they still hadn't returned. I then was told by some concerned neighbors that they had missed several appointments and had never checked out of the Airbnb. All their belongings (wallet, clothing, keys, car, hiking boots, etc.) were still there and the local police had been notified. At 8AM on President's day, I get woken up by reporters at my door saying that a massive search was underway, the police arrived a few hours later to conduct a search for clues into their disappearance. They were looking for them with dogs, helicopters, drones, etc. and were unable to find so much as a trace of them.

On Wednesday, I got word that the search teams were transitioning from search and rescue mode to body recovery mode. Just yesterday, I heard that they were planning on scaling back the search starting Monday since there was an increasing chance they would never find them, dead or alive.

I was going to meet with some the one of their relatives today when, suddenly, he had to cancel at the last moment due to an update from search and rescue crews. About half an hour later, I got a call that they had been found alive!

It's been an absolutely crazy week. Yesterday, I was praying that they would at least find their bodies so the family could get some closure, and today I learned that they found them alive! Will post updates as I found out more.

happy,I knew a kid in my old school that never spoke.,"I knew a kid in my old school that never spoke. I was kinda a loner myself but it easy necessarily by choice. 

He sat alone at lunch, and I didn't have anyone to sit with so I just quietly ate with him every day. 

I soon noticed he was in a lot of my classes and I started just sitting with him.

When he thought no one was looking he would smile at jokes or start to doodle , but as soon as he knew someone was watching he would go blank. 

Naturally kids started picking on him a little, trying to get him to talk or asking him why he never spoke. None of it seemed to phase him and he would just shrug or smile. 

But what really got me mad was when the teachers would draw attention to him . when they would call roll they would pause at him sometimes and poke fun at how he wasn't going to answer. He would go really numb and still when this happened. 

One day I snapped at a teacher to ""leave him the heck alone"" and ""if you feel the need to look cool in front of a bunch of middle schoolers by making fun of a child then you’re a pathetic person""

I'll never forget the way he looked at me when I was sent to the office. He had his mouth open like he *wanted* to say something.

At the office a councilor sat with me and explained that the boys father died in Afghanistan and he hasn't spoken to anyone but his mom since. 

I learned a lot about people from him. I leaned how cruel they can be, I learned how kind and compassionate they can be. But the thing I learned from him that was most valuable was the power of listening. 

I tried to take my life in November of that year, and I was gone for a few weeks. The entire school totally knew about it.

When I got back he was waiting by my locker. 

He said hi. 

I thought it was someone else but he gave me a hug and said hi again. 

It was the most meaningful thing anyone had said to me during that time. 

I cried a little and after that he began to speak to me really quietly. it was little things at first like hello and good bye but soon he was asking how my day was and before I knew it he was rolling in laughter at my dumb jokes. 

He knew more about me than anyone because he listened.

I moved to a different school, I still wonder about him almost every day.

Day 6 of No School and Home Stay: We finally got through the day, and then, at bedtime, I made up a story about 2 brothers and a sister who were called ""Stinky Bros &amp; Sis."" They were siblings who fart with every interaction. They run a business that uses their farts to fly hot air balloons and go-carts. I pretty much ended every sentence with fart noises..

I can't even tell you the laughter from them. Roaring laughter. It's easy to forget with all that's going on in the world, how deliciously funny farts are to kids (and adults).

Parent tip: Don't tell fart stories right before bed. They'll never go to sleep. So, that part backfired a bit. 🤦",3InaRow,self.happy,1584892748

For me my personal feeling have always been pushed away by other but with the impact she has left on me it makes me feel like for once someone who’s not direct family actually cares about me.

happy,After months of job hunting .. I started a new job today and love it!! Excited to see where the opportunity will take me!,"
I (26F) have always had trouble getting along with people at my previous job. I feel we couldn’t click and just awkward tension. I’m very introverted so maybe that’s why I felt like I was awkward? I had a recruiter which out to me about a job and they pay a really good salary and no interview was needed! Usually I’m skeptical and I’ve been through interviews without much success. But for some reason I had a really good feeling about this job and really felt excited about it. So I got up this morning and went .. the person that is leaving and training me was sooooo lovely. We chat throughout the whole day and she’s honestly so cool (kind of sad she’s leaving even though I met her today) the CEO was also very welcoming and not uptight like most CEOs are, he is really understanding… the Vice President as well is a bit older and sweet.. I have a good feeling about this job! What I learned today was very very overwhelming and complicated and unfortunately the person that is leaving is only training me this week since her last day is Friday so I’m a bit nervous for being stuck on my own next week! But I’m excited and I know I can grow here !!",bluecotum,self.happy,1619565168

She kept telling me how cute she thought I looked and kept wanting to take my picture. At one point, I think she was jumping up and down she was so excited. At the time, I assumed she was just being nice, but looking back, I'm pretty sure she was definitely flirting with me. I think the reason I remember it so well is because I don't usually get attention from the opposite sex, and definitely did not expect that kind of reaction with this outfit, and it was a huge confidence boost for me. I always remember how warm and giddy she made me feel that day and that bit of attention helped me be more comfortable with myself. Now I enjoy wearing bow ties and suspenders often and am more confident because of the reactions I've gotten.

happy,I finally got my teeth fixed after a lifetime of despising them and never smiling,"Basically just the title.

I have hated my teeth for as long as I can rememeber (26 now). I tried to speak as little as possible/cover my mouth when I speak to hide them, I rarely smile and definitely never do an open mouth smile in case people notice how bad they are. The only people who see my teeth are those I'm closest to, because its draining to try and hide them at all times.

Rationally, they weren't *that bad*, e.g. all my friends and family told me they were nothing to worry about, and I know if I saw someone else with teeth like mine I'd never think ""ew they have gross teeth"". It just felt that everyone around me had nice teeth, while I'm stuck here with couple snaggle teeth and major gaps.

I never got them fixed before as, quite frankly, I just couldnt afford it (who would've guessed dental health is expensive), but I found an AMAZING dentist, who informed me of an affordable option that would work for me and I thought f*ck it let's do this.

So I did.

And I'm so happy.

I got my smile back.

happy,My sister and I helped a lost girl get home safe and sound.,"Lately I've been sad and angry due to the state of the world right now. It just seems like many people have forgotten how to just be human beings. So I love seeing and reading people doing things for others for no other reason except helping a fellow human. Today I was blessed with the opportunity to do so. 

As I said earlier, I'm sad and angry and that was the state of mind I was in when I walked to the store today. In fact, I was extra grumpy because I had already gone to the store earlier and they were out of what I wanted and told me to come back a few hours later, so this was my second trip. 

As I was walking home I noticed a young girl walking a block ahead of me and a man and his toddler behind me. I wasn't really paying much attention, I just wanted to get home and figure out why I wasn't getting sound to one of my ear buds. When I got to my house I saw the girl, who was walking in front of me, sitting on my steps looking dejected. I asked if she was okay and if she was thirsty. She just asked if she could use my phone. I figured she was going to make a call, so I unlocked it and gave it to her. She was actually looking at Google Maps to figure out how far she was from home, and she told me her story.

She had gotten out of school a few hours earlier and the bus was late. Her dad was supposed to pick her up and he must have been late, so she decided to walk home. She ended up getting lost and had been walking around for three hours trying to get home. I've been there, so I felt so bad for her. From the map I could see it would be another hour of walking to get from my house to hers. So I decided to get her safely on the bus to get home.

I invited her inside because the bus wouldn't be arriving for another 30 minutes. I let my sister know what was going on and grabbed my change bag to get bus fare for her. My sister, offered her to share her dinner with her. She mentioned that she hadn't eaten since lunch at school. I grabbed her a bottle if water and we (my sister and I) ordered her an Uber. The Uber arrived right as she finished eating and I saw her to the car and waved her off. Both my sister and I were in a good mood just from being able to help her.

An hour later the doorbell rings. She came back with her mom, dad, and brother. They came back to our house to thank us for making sure she got home safely. They had been searching for her and called the police to find her. To say they were relived would be an understatement. That they came all the way back just hits me in my feels. I wasn't looking for thanks or recognition, I just wanted to make sure she made it home. 

Now, instead on being sad and angry, I'm feeling happy and squishy. I'm going to go happy cry now, thank you for reading.",SylverFyre777,self.happy,1619480590

happy,"In January, my date sexually assaulted me. Today, I reached out to his family and I've never been prouder of myself.","I (F) dated a man briefly earlier this year having known him for a much longer time before that. On one of our dates, and not the first time we were alone, he assaulted me. And since then, he started to ignore me and refused to have a conversation about it when I told him he'd made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. 

That's the context. 

I went to meet him, he refused to apologise. 

I asked his friend to talk sense into him, he refused. 

I asked him again to talk with me, and he refused. 

All this while, he made sure to remind me that I was crazy for making it a bit deal. But I was determined that I would not let him get away with it. Not because he's a horrible man, but because I know that he could be better if someone actually helped him learn how to fix things and not fuck up again. 

Last week, I told two people in my life the whole story. They didn't judge me. And that made me feel supported and strong and confident. 

Today, I reached out to his family. It was the scariest thing I have ever done in my life. I was terrified (even though I know I'm not at fault, rationally) of being judged by protective and defensive family members. Of being called names and being shamed. Or going through another traumatic experience. 

That didn't happen. They are so kind. 

And we're going to work together to help him learn.

The second time, I was trying to figure out how to shape it but I messed it up beyond repair, and had to shave it again.

It's a new feeling I've never felt, and it makes me feel like I've completed a rite of passage.

I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

happy,"I bought the PS4 game : ""The Talos Principle"" and I have been in puzzle-solving heaven for two weeks now!!","Got it on sale too!!!!     16 dollars marked down from 65!! 

What a gem of a little game this is. It brings me back to how I felt when I first played Portal 2, one of my favorite games.  I am a stickler for the ""classic"" era of puzzle solving/adventure/platforming games where you either solve increasingly difficult puzzles/challenges and/or collect things along the way to open up new areas.    Think along the lines of Crash Bandicoot,  Spyro The Dragon, Jak and Daxter, and Yooka-Laylee!   And then there's the survival horror classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill before they turned into hardcore action games. 

Don't get me wrong, I love other types of games too, but there's something ultimately satisfying about the replayability of these other types. At least for me! I tend to get bored easily by RPGs where you walk around and go on ""looting"" quests and constantly upgrade your character. 

What is making this moment so special for me, however, is that it is sparing me the agonizing anxiety and depression I was feeling due to these lockdowns (up in Ontario,  Canada). I can distract myself, immerse myself, and I genuinely feel much calmer and content. This is how I used to be when I played video games as a teenager and child, but lately, I struggle to find a game I'm willing to spend money on, especially because of the reasons mentioned before. 

The humor in Portal made me laugh my ass off and I can still smile when I randomly think of quotes from it, and the philosophy in THIS game really makes me think, as well as the  scenery making me feel calm. 

Very good game, and I can't wait for the sequel!",masterofmydomain89,self.happy,1619326407

I've never been so completely happy with someone. I can be myself. We have the same sense of humor. We share so many interests that the ones we don't are just interesting to explore. It's fun to get more into hers and see her get more into mine. 

We even fight well, I can barely even call them fights. More like temporary miscommunications, and we wind up with good solutions that make things even better. And the communication is next level, it's so simple when you can just outright speak your mind.


Part of me wishes we'd been here all along, but we wouldn't have made it like we were back then. Had some growing up to do on both sides. It's so rewarding to have grown with someone and grown together over such a long time. We already know each other.

Well after months of deliberation, I have concluded a few key terms to give yourself the key experience of reddit.

So what is Reddit?

Reddit is spending hours on end looking at the content that your fellow redditors have put hard effort into.

Reddit is leaving your thoughts and feelings in comments where they can be respected and actually taken into consideration by content creators.

Reddit is making dozens of posts filled with your own ideas only to have them fail either by unpopularity or being taken down by Reddit mods.

Reddit is, even after all adversity, posting again. Having the dedication to keep sharing your ideas, to make constant revisions and changes to your ideas to make them better.

Reddit is that one magical moment where just ONE of your ideas starts to be appreciated and respected by your community. 

Reddit is about connection, having people that you have not met enjoy what you have created. The ability to share your personal interests with thousands of other people on earth to make them feel like they are not alone.

Reddit is giving someone that small push of positivity to nudge them toward a better day or better life.

Reddit is changing the attitude of thousands, possibly millions.

Reddit is changing a life.

I have to get to work at noon, therefore I uSuallly would have gotten up at 9 to open Christmas present and have breakfast with my two, opening the presents with ample picture time (I loathe this),getting ready and dressed to leave by 11 am just to not be rushing.
I woke up at 10:30 am, knowing I am far behind schedule 
Said f the brekky- we need to rip open these gifts, we take turns and I am making ten second intermissions to grab my makeup and get ready (pictures being taken throughout the whole process) 

That’s sort of the part, because normally on these conditions I would be Uber stressed out and mad and mean, but this year was different. I loved being with my family, I loved my families reactions to all the things that I had thought hey, maybe he’d like this. Maybe mom would use this. It was the first Christmas I felt like I actually had given to people and they loved the gifts they had received and  more so just me yelling at my mother to rip that baby open faster faster move move we gotta go! I felt like the most family oriented drill sergeant. I made it to work in time, and usually holidays aren’t nice. They are painstakingly filled with fights and grudges, this year was different 
And I am so happy to have that as the best gift to receive in 2019.

I think I finally realized Christmas for me is all about the excitement that you get when you’re around family and friends not the gifts that’s for the kids. It’s enough to know that my whole family is spending time together for Christmas. But to be a man and know that your little ones (kids, siblings, cousins, or just people who depend on you) are going to have a good Christmas. It’s a touchy feeling, not gonna lie. 

The message has been clear the whole time and it took me 20 years to realize it, CHRISTMAS REALLY ISN’T ABOUT THE GIFTS.

I am almost going to reach the 150s in weight. I am at a 161 lbs today. I am slowly losing weight, but the weight is coming off. I was initially at 166. I arrived at this weight rapidly due to depression and stress. My skin is clearing, and I am finally going outside after over a year of being a hermit inside my home. I enjoy swinging on my swing in my backyard, and going for a stroll outside. I might get a cat soon. 

I am still heartbroken over a recent breakup and seeing my ex move on so quickly and so seriously. However, I am slowly but surely crawling out of it. My heart is healing. Today I feel  optimistic - I feel different. :)

I told myself that when I reach the stage where I am confident in my body and soul, I would like to hire a professional photoshoot for myself. I am looking forward to that day where I can dazzlingly smile and laugh for the camera, be in a beautiful summer dress in a field of flowers, have healthy long flowing hair, and look as free as I feel in the inside. Perhaps a bit weird, but oh well. :) I don't have much photos taken of me by others, and I think it would be a wonderful gift and moment to have and cherish.",heart-full-of-napalm,self.happy,1626892270

happy,The day my uncle really became like my dad,"So, for context, my actual dad was in prison most of my life so my mom raised me all on her own. My uncle was distant but still came around frequently, always came to my birthday parties, the usual. He was just very closed off a lot of the time because my then aunt, years before I was born, had a miscarriage and it tore them apart. He had a certain edginess about him but obviously never did any harm or said anything mean to me or my mom. 

It was when I was 14 that my dad was finally released from prison. The person I’d never been in the physical presence of was finally going to come home. Sadly though, it wasn’t to be. He never came home and basically left town and never returned. The last person he spoke to was my uncle, his brother, and told him he wanted nothing to do with the family and never looked back. The night my mom told me this, I broke down and cried myself to sleep. It was the next day though where things got even worse. 

It was late Saturday morning and my mom was out with friends from work but my uncle was over at our place. We’d had a bad storm a few days prior and our porch swing chain had busted, so he was there to fix it. I didn’t even say hi to him that morning. I just kept reading the card I’d written for my dad that I wouldn’t be able to give to him. Suddenly, as people say they saw red, so did I. I was overcome with such raw anger and hatred that I’d never felt about anything before that I tore the card apart and then unleashed Hell on my room. I smashed my mirror, threw my chair, all the while screaming at the top of my lungs over and over again. I don’t know how long this went on for, but I then felt hands on me and got scared. It was my uncle and I kept pushing and shoving him to get away. All he did was hold my face in his hands and he looked petrified. We didn’t say anything and all he did was pull me in and hugged me tight and I really started crying hard and loud. I couldn’t even hug him back because I was so exhausted from what I’d just done that I felt like I was going to pass out. All I said over and over was his name, not even calling him Uncle anymore. 

And anytime I sounded like I was going to start up again, he just said “Ssh baby girl, it’s alright”. This was the longest I’d ever been in pretty much anybody’s arms and, despite everything I was going through, he made me feel safe like I’d never felt before. After probably 10 minutes of silence, he finally asked what happened and I explained everything. I started crying again when I talked about my dad and he said “I’m not going anywhere” or something like that. He also said he would clean up the mess I’d made and said not to worry about my mom. He covered for me. I don’t know exactly what he said, but she must have bought it. And I felt bad a bit since I don’t like keeping things from my mom. 

From that day on, he slowly became a different person. He was still pretty quiet and soft spoken like he is now but was much more open and just a “gentle yet confident” vibe about him that he still has to this day. We started spending more time together and almost every weekend, if me and my mom weren’t doing anything or I wasn’t with my friends, I spent it with him. Those were probably the happiest days of my life, in addition to other things that happened in my life of course. I even overheard him like a year later on the phone with someone and he said “No I’m with my kid this weekend. I can’t come”. He called me his kid. That brought me such immense happiness and joy I hadn’t felt before. Then again, he’d been calling me kiddo, baby and sweetie for a while now, so I guess he saw me as his own. 

That’s all I wanted to talk about. Hope you all enjoyed reading it.",drift_apart_together,self.happy,1626708325

happy,"The first time I ever called my kid ""baby girl""","So I made a post way back when just detailing how I've been taking care of my niece since she was a baby after my sister, her mom, passed away. I took her in as my own when she was 5 and officially adopted her last year.

But, when she was 9, I had to leave her with my parents because I got fired from my job and was on the verge of losing our apartment. Needless to say it was not an easy thing to do and it tore me apart, especially hearing her call out for me and begging me not to leave. I tried to make her understand but she wouldn't hear it. I spent the next about seven months working two jobs before finally landing somewhere decent that I work now. And I was preparing to bring her back with me when something unfortunate happened.

My dad had an accident at home and had to go to the hospital. He fell down the stairs and hit his head hard. She had to call 911 all on her own because my mom wasn't home then. Thankfully it wasn't too serious and he was pretty much stable by the time he got to the hospital. And when I got there to see him, not only was my niece there of course, but she ran away when I came in because she was just so angry. Angry and scared, actually.

I chased her outside and she immediately kept pushing me and telling me to go away but I just wrapped her in my arms and she immediately held on tight. I apologized profusely to her and couldn't stand the sight of her crying like this. I nearly cried myself looking at her but held it together somehow. ""I was so scared. I missed you"" she said. ""I know baby girl, I know. I missed you too"" I replied. I explained that I was going to come back for her and bring her back to live with me again and, while she didn't smile, she gave a hopeful ""Really?"", ""Really"". She even made note of how I was smiling for the first time in so long and said ""You don't ever smile"", and we both laughed.

Once she calmed down enough, I carried her back inside and just sat with my dad and other family for a bit. She didn't let go of me the whole time and sat in my lap, eventually falling asleep in my arms on my chest. I then took her home, carried her all the way inside and to her room, said ""Goodnight baby girl"" and went to bed.

So that's my story. I don't really have a reason for posting this other than just today was a really good day for me, mainly because of work and getting a small promotion. We ""celebrated"" in our own way and it was just nice. She's also kicking ass in her classes as she's also in the school's gifted program. And that's all I really have to say for now.

happy,The Best Investment For Our Future Health,"The best investment for your future is not financial, such as investing in index funds. Or physical, like doing yoga every day. Though both can help. A study of 724 men conducted by Harvard allowed this question to be studied. What is the best investment of time and energy now for our future health and happiness? It turns out to be relationships.

## The Study

The study tracked participants health and happiness over a 74 year period. **And the single best indicator of happiness and health in later life was the strength of individuals relationships**. Building and maintaining strong relationships will be better for your health than more money or prestige, most of the time.

When we try and discover the impacts of decisions on our future health, we often try to work backwards. We start with an older individual. Then use the fallible tool of memory to isolate decisions and trends from their life that led them to where they are now. The use of memory often results in errors because memory is fallible.

This study attempted to bypass this problem by tracking the people as they grew up. Recording decisions, health, happiness, and wealth year by year. It’s called the Harvard Study of Adult Development.

## The Harvard Study of Adult Development.

In 1938 the study began. It followed 724 men(the 1940’s weren’t great at gender equality) through their lives. The participants came from all parts of the societal strata, upper, middle, and lower class.

One group of boys were specifically selected as sophomores (year 10 here in Australia) from Harvard College. While another group of the boys were selected from Boston’s poorest neighbourhoods. The boys from these areas came from mostly disadvantaged backgrounds.

The study measured health, happiness, financial success, aspirations and dreams. They routinely checked in year after year. Sending out another questionnaire, sitting them down for yet another interview. Today most of the participants have passed away. But the study continues to track their children and grandchildren.

[Robert Waldinger, the current director of the study and fourth director in total presented a TED talk watched by millions on their findings.](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?language=en)

## The Findings

This study allowed the future consequences of many actions to be measured. Does more money make you happier? Do cholesterol levels in your mid 50’s have a correlation to health in later life?

Now, these answers are almost impossible to answer because of [correlation vs causation](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson#:~:text=To%20answer%20questions%20like%20this,the%20values%20of%20two%20variables.&amp;text=Causation%20means%20that%20one%20event%20causes%20another%20event%20to%20occur.). But what this study has allowed researchers to do is find the best indicator of future health. And the best indicator found was the quality of individuals relationships. The people with better quality relationships were happier and healthier.

## The Power Of Relationships

Three of the most important findings from the study were:

## 1#: Social connections are good, loneliness kills

Social connections are really good for humans. We evolved as social animals in tribes. Therefore we need close and strong social connections. And the lack of connection or loneliness kills. When isolated, we suffer terribly. Investing in relationships are key. Participants who had strong social connections were happier and healthier.

## 2#: It's the quality of relationships that matters most

Deep trusting relationships were the best indicator of future health. Not the number of relationships. The men with the highest satisfaction in their relationships, not the most relationships, at 50 were the healthiest at 80.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

## 3#: Social connections protect our brain

People in strong relationships, who felt they could trust and rely on their spouses, families, and friends, experienced higher retention of memory and cognitive abilities. Loneliness and poor relationships either don't inhibit or potentially cause quicker memory loss.

## Why Is This Surprising To Most Of Us?

Most of us want more money. [We're often hard wired to chase wealth and status](https://thehappyorchardblog.com/the-score-cards-that-count-in-your-life/). It is rare to survey a millennial who would put strong caring relationships in their top goals for life.

## Good Relationships Aren't Sexy

Being rich and famous is glamorous. We think being able to buy whatever we want will make us healthy and happy. It turns out investing in the quality of our relationships is a much better way to secure future health and happiness.

But this is counter-intuitive. We get caught up in the rat race of life. In the busyness, careers, eating well and exercising, buying a bigger house. Relationships are often left by the wayside.

Working on relationships is not sexy or glamorous. It's plain old hard work, a slog. I find myself sometimes thinking about other things I should be doing instead when spending time on relationships. Coffees with friends or long chats with families(virtual or face to face) leave the dishes not done or the bathroom not clean.

It's also scary to reach out to strengthen relationships, to open the door for others. Inviting people for tea, making the first phone call or proposing the weekly catch up. We open up to rejection. To the door being slammed in our face.

Just know each instance I go out of my way to strengthen my relationships with my spouse, friends and families. I have felt better afterwards.

Sometimes it won't work out, and sometimes the dishes will be left dirty. But we now know that investing in our relationships is the single best way to impact our future health and happiness. So, turn TV time to family board game night. Plan a monthly date night, or reach out to that friend for a zoom catch up. You will feel better afterwards. And you are protecting your heart and mind in the process.",thehappyorchardblog,self.happy,1621935158

She was awake and happy to see me, we discussed for a few hours I guess... I didn't really realised it felt like an instant. I wanted to stay there longer but I had to go back before it was completly dark outside, my aunt was worried about that too so she had to somewhat force me to go back before night time.

In the end I went there at 4 pm, arrived à 5:30 pm, stated a bit, went back at 8:30 pm and arrived at 10 pm.

I kind of stalled there and was honestly not sure if I was getting myself into the similar situation as my previous employer. Boss kept telling me I am vital and do good work so I kept grinding.

Finally last week got a rather significant promotion and the raise to go with it. On top of that I am now fast tracking to replace my boss when he retires in 2 years.

* Fear Setting vs. Goal Setting

If you are making a big decision in life, write down you worst fears in details. Goals are already in your mind.
After that, create action plans for your fears.

* Theory of Reversible Action

You can boost your self-confidence by taking actions. In most cases, you also can return to your original state after taking actions, so you can forgive yourself when your actions doesn't work out. Actions will compound and your confidence will increase.

* Mission over Obstacles, Strengths over Weaknesses

Think more about your mission and less about your obstacles. High mission gives you high self-confidence.",thumbsdrivesmecrazy,self.happy,1645476864

I never finished college because I was working 60-hour weeks managing a Starbucks and at 20 years old that was plenty to make my head nice and big. But things change with time and I ended up leaving that job for office work only a few years later and then left the workforce all together to do the mom gig.

It's been great, it really has and I count myself lucky to have spent the last 9 years at home raising my willful little kiddos, but like everyone else the pandemic made me reevaluate and I realized that I was missing the intellectual stimulation from having a career. Luckily my neighbor recommended taking some classes through this local tech company and I finally decided this was my in.

happy,Worked my ever-loving tail off and got the job of my dreams after an eternity of self doubt and shame over past failures!,"Hello! 

I need to share my story somewhere because for the first time, I am genuinely proud of my resilience,  and accomplishments.  

I F30, made the heartbreaking decision to leave post secondary after I realised I was having my first baby at 22 and knew that my chosen career in academics was simply not going to happen. My grades weren't good enough for the highly competitive graduate program. I was seriously unwell mentally while in school and post partum. I spent the better part of the next 6 years crushed under the weight of my own failure. I was very unhappy. My poor husband didn't know what to do to help me. 

I would cycle through new hobbies, get bored and move on. I was in therapy for most of this time and learned a lot about myself and how to overcome this. 


About 3 years ago, I took up drawing. I took up drawing, but I never put it down. I drew CONSTANTLY. I made myself a curriculum. I learned to draw human anatomy half decent, animals etc. Then I started looking for jobs that would accept a talented, albeit amateur artist. 

Boy howdy did I find something. 6 months ago I got a volunteer position at a tattoo studio (they had no apprentice positions available). I worked my tail off. Up to 20 hours a week, for free, with kids and another job. 

And it paid off. I made so many incredible friends. They are so generous with their knowledge and really have been helping me improve. 

I got the apprenticeship 2 weeks ago. My mentor told me I have an extremely promising career ahead of me. 

I know I worked so hard to get here. I worked with my counsellor to get my mind in a state where I COULD put that kind of work in without quitting. I had to put wants aside and focus to make this my career and I did it. 

I cannot believe it. The studio I am at is very well respected and for the first time in my entire life I am proud of myself. 

Also became a better mom in this process so my relationship with my kids and husband is also thriving. 

Just all around a really positive change and while I will always have work regarding my mental health. I feel healthy.

I thought it was a honeymoon phase, but I still really, REALLY like my lady friend, more and more all the time. I've never met somebody so sweet, loving, caring, funny, and unbelievably pretty. And I'm so lucky because I can tell her those things every day. She doesn't always believe she's the most beautiful, or dresses the nicest, or is always perfect, but she is to me. I constantly tell her how amazing she is and she gets this big smile that melts my heart. She's happy, feels good about herself, she's more comfortable and confident than I've ever seen her, and I'm proud to help with that. She's done so much since I've met her, big and small, and I'm always so proud of her. She's always so affectionate and loving. She can't always show the love when she what's to, but she always makes sure I know it's there. 

She's amazing, beautiful, makes me happier than anything or anybody ever has. Shes given me purpose and so many reasons to love. I love her so much and I've never felt this lucky.",SchmidtOuttaLuck,self.happy,1640537398

I had a lot of money saved up, but i went through it pretty quickly when I wasn’t working at all, or when we were working again and I got taken out by covid and there was no assistance. I was just taking to a bar guest while I was working, and he was asking about Christmas. How things were with my family. I told him that it was good, but i wish I could have done more for my family, things are just really tight because of covid we are still catching up and taking off for paternity/maternity leave when we don’t really get paid for it, but at the end of the day that’s on me for choosing this profession. He didn’t like that we don’t get paid for paternity leave. He tries to leave me 1500$ 
I don’t him not to worry about it, I really appreciate it but it’s not really worth it, things will be fine and I split tips anyway so it wouldn’t all go to me. He said he understood and said merry Christmas and walked away. I saw the slip minutes later as I was entering it. He decided to change it to 3000$ since I was splitting tips. He single handedly caught me back up from taking Off for paternity leave and I don’t really know what to do except be happy and post about it here.

I always struggled with my own self image and confidence. I battled bipolar depression, anxiety, and just over all self hatred. I used to think I wouldn’t be around long enough to see myself get my own happily ever after. 

But this man has loved me through every step for the past 3 years. He has helped me become the version of myself I want to be. 

I have many regrets in life but sitting here today, I wouldn’t change a single thing in my life because it brought me here. It brought me to him and I’m never letting go.

happy,"How focus is building my confidence, helps to relieve stress, and has helped motivate me."," 

The power of focus... Focus breeds efficiency. Efficiency leads to less time spent doing tasks! This becomes especially important when involved in doing the tasks that are necessary but not our favorite things to do, right? Discipline obviously plays a key role in this paradigm, and the reason why all of this is so important to me today is because for most of my life, I had none of these! I went through a ten-year period turning my life around, letting go of childhood resentments, and ensuing trust and entitlement issues. The ability to truly be present, disciplined, and focused now like I wasn't able to do before means a lot to me today. The thing that I'm most grateful for is that now by being able to apply these principles in my own life, I'm accomplishing the goals I set out to do! Also, it's giving me a strong mental record of success, increasing my self-confidence, and even helping me lower or even eliminate stress over the duties I have.. I know I'm going to get it done. It's a win/win/win! I'm on my way to becoming a counselor now, and I feel a duty to honor all of the help that I was given by paying it forward!

happy,I helped my immigrant father get a raise.,"My father is one of the hardest workers I know. I don't remember a time when his hand wasn't covered in callouses. He and my mother reached out to me and asked if I could write them a letter asking the CEO of the company he works at for a minor raise. The long and the short of it is that my father works the same position at the same company, just at a different location. When he transferred to the new location (which was closer to home), they reduced his pay by 3$. When he asked his manager for a raise, he was denied. He wanted to take the request straight to the top, to the CEO of the entire company.

Being immigrants, my parents have enough English to get them through the day, but they lack the more complex or niche language skills. That's where I come in - I drafted up a letter and sent it over to my mom who rewrote the letter word by word since she doesn't know how to operate a printer. They express-mailed it and today they called me saying he got the raise.

If I'm honest, I didn't even think the letter would reach the CEO of the company. It feels good knowing I helped, even if just a little. I graduated with an English degree but I've been jobless and discouraged after trying to study for the GRE. I've been feeling useless and hopeless, but today I felt a little more like I had purpose.",bpd_bitch,self.happy,1598488216

Just wanted to give one of my first ever updates ever oooooh. I am right now the happiest I've been since I can remember and am in the best mind space I've been in for awhile(thanks Lexapro 😁). I've never been one the dealt with depression or anxiety where it was debilitating my whole life. Last year, it hit me hard all at once and for a long time I didn't know how to deal with it obviously. A lot of sleepless nights and cry sessions(thanks val). I just felt like I was a different person than who I was just a few months ago. A part of me started giving up and without my support system I might of but I can happily say I've made it through the rough patch I believe. I AM HAPPY FOR ONCE :).

Physically have been having multiple problems but am working and dealing with them daily and that's okay cuz we tough out here. BUT besidez that I have dropped 16lbs in the last month with my cut and have really cleaned up my diet, shooting for 200lbs in the next month, lose all this rona weight. I stopped eating pizza weekly and Oreos daily, like I used to eat PACKS of Oreos daily. I WAS ADDICTED and I'm not no one-sleeve chump out here. 

Most importantly, I got engaged!!!! 🤑 Time to save all the dat cash money on taxes. Just kidding, am seriously super excited to get hitched with the girl of my dreams. She's my #1 swolemate always and she pretty cute tho 😜. 

TLDR just had a lot of stuff going on last year and am for the first time in months not faking being happy. So wanted to tell everyone lol, have a good day and if you made to the end, thanks for listening. 🤗

PS. If anyone out there just needs is going through a lot and just needs someone to chat to please don't hesitate to message me. And if you anyone out there is really struggling and considering suicide. Please call  1800-273-8255 and get the help you need.

happy,The dark old cloud is finally gone! 🌻 I'm doing better now.,"Three months ago, I quit my job. My boss sexually harassed me for a year, manipulated me with my money, and eventually left me penniless after he decided to hold on to my paychecks to keep me around. He always reminded me that I was a nobody without him, and that no one would ever hire me. He made my self esteem crash. After I resigned, I went through a lot of traumatic flashbacks (I was sexually abused as I kid), suffered night terrors, had a million panic attacks and crying spells everyday, lost a lot of weight, and fell into depression. Got a job at a retail store where I was treated like garbage by the manager and forced myself to quit 2 weeks in because I couldn't stand being treated in such a way again. I was really at my lowest of lows for two and a half months. On top of that, my (now former) best guy friend ghosted me. Just as we were getting romantic, he cut me off with no explanation. I had no one to turn to. He didn't even know what I was going through and I was about to tell him everything. It all became too much. I have a history of suicide attempts and I was plotting another one. 

The night that I kept contemplating suicide, a friend reached out regarding the teaching position. I got the interview. Now all I needed to do was go in and show them how well suited I was for the job. That's exactly what I did. They loved me and offered me the position on the spot. They said they typically wait things out and get a feel for the person applying but that they loved my attitude and also the fact that I had some experience already. That interview was two weeks ago.
Today was my first day! It went so great! I'm so happy to be in an environment where I am respected. I don't have to worry about being touched or being verbally condescended. I cut my hair to cut memorie ties with my boss, as he loved touching my hair and I died a little inside every time. I look and I feel fantastic. I'm back to my workout and diet routine (I'm a competitor). And love is at my door. An old friend and I have reconnected the past two weeks and now we have a date! We've always liked each other but timing was off. We just randomly started talking again and this time, timing is just right. I'm taking things slow with this one because I really do want this with him. I have such a good feeling about everything. I guess tables do turn for the better. I'm glad I took the risk to leave my former job. It's like after that huge grey cloud went away, the rain came and the flowers came back to life.",miladagi,self.happy,1598316103

After many, many, many, many of these conversations I started believing him. My family was always supportive of me getting more education. My ex would isolate me from my family.

He didn’t want me to thrive. I think deep down, he didn’t want his girlfriend to be more educated than him. I think that would’ve hurt his ego. I didn’t recognize how slowly and smoothly he turned me around so I’d march away from college. Honestly, I don’t believe he realized he was doing it. I think he really, actually believes college is a scam to get your money!

Now that I’m single and thinking for myself, I just paid for my first ever college class! Class starts this week! I can’t wait to thrive!!

happy,I'm happy to tell about my past achievements in life and how I accomplished them.," When I was 18 I weighed 395 pounds, I found this out stepping on the scale at the doctors office at a appointment. When I was in the second grade I had a thyroid problem which made me gain tons of weight in a little amount of time. I was an obese child and teen getting made fun of and picked on at school. When I got into high school I had friends and went out sometimes but being obese it was hard enjoying certain activities. The day I was at the doctors office I made a commitment to change, after the doctor told me being 395 pounds was not at all good for my health. I started on the Atkins diet eating lean meats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. I started out walking for exercise but grew to love other forms of exercise such as weight lifting, yoga, aerobics, and especially jogging. In 8 months I lost 100 pounds I graduated high school with people amazed by the way I was looking I kept going and by the time I turned 21 I had lost 270 plus pounds. I was thrilled but had lots of excess skin on my body especially my tummy. I ended up getting skin removal surgery, which was painful but worth it. I think back at this goal and get very very happy. I never stopped loving exercise, I worked out the whole time I was pregnant. I'm currently training for my dream career for a better life for my son. Thinking back to this huge achievement I accomplished gives me the strength to train for my career. This makes me extremely happy, finally I shared my past with people instead of hiding it. I'm so so happy I finally told people about my skin surgery as well. I've had a huge smile on my face lately.",AleckLove,self.happy,1600846642

Now many people I’ve told said “yeah but do you want long distance?” The great thing is, I’m moving again to a neighbouring city for university and we are only about an hour away by train or drive. 

I fell hard for this boy after I found myself genuinely smiling. Not a masked smile that I normally do to make people around me more comfortable because I am faking looking happy. A real, genuine, smile. He makes me feel amazing and warm on the inside.

happy,I was thinking about my friendships lately and I realized how far I've come,"I used to have one friend in elementary school, but we went to different high schools. I was an awkward and shy teen. I was convinced that I will never again make friends with anyone, to the degree that I used to have panic attacks just thinking about it. Now, I live with three college friends and I couldn't ask for better flatmates. Living with people I'm completely comfortable around, sharing political and societal views with them, being able to communicate without words, knowing that my personal space will be respected and just generally feeling accepted and loved... I know it's a cliche trope, but I really feel like I found my family.

Two weeks ago I graduated college. After my defense, I returned home to find my roommates have bought champagne and rum to celebrate and a gorgeous bouquet with red, blue and purple flowers (I'm bi and it was a very nice gesture of passive acceptance). As we toasted I remember thinking back to that hyperventilating fifteen year old in the cafeteria that was wistfully looking at other high schoolers getting along as she was trying to hold back tears eating on her own. I want to tell her she'll make it. That she'll find people she'll form unbreakable bonds with.

I can't express how much friendship with these people means to me, but I wish everyone finds something like that, be it friendship or a romantic relationship, everyone deserves to feel this safe and accepted.",Teathe42,self.happy,1642666371

happy,"Go compliment a stranger, it will make their day","Idk I feel like I need to share this because it was one of the most simple and best things that’s ever happened to me. Today was a really rough day today. I had a super boring class and was not looking forward to going to work at all because we had some sort of fundraiser that was supposed to boost our sales majorly and make us all stressed out. I get to work and I’m joking around with one of my coworkers about my failed tinder attempts as well as how I use it as a negative coping mechanism in order to find validation. I’m really insecure about myself and I use tinder to help that, I know that’s very bad lol. Anyways, this really cute guy comes in wearing an Air Force (I think?) uniform so I go to help him out. 

After helping him I notice him kind of lurking around the store and occasionally looking in my direction. When he’s finished he comes back up to me and my coworkers and the manager approaches him asking if he needs anything else. He kind of stammers and points at me so I go up to him just thinking that he wanted me to help him with  another order or say something about the order I had already helped him with before. 

Instead he says “your eyes are so pretty,” and I was so shocked. It really boosted my confidence especially since I have been going through a rough tinder phase. I don’t know but maybe he just said it because he felt bad for me when I was talking to my coworker about my horror stories but I like to think he really meant it. 

I said thank you and wished him a good night. I really hope he comes back in the store when I’m working bc I’m kind of mad he didn’t ask for my snap or anything lol. But whatever it made me so giddy and boosted my self confidence for the rest of the night. 

Anyways please just compliment strangers. Don’t be embarrassed about saying something because it can really help someone out and make their day. I know I will try harder to compliment strangers. We need more positivity in the world for sure!",Witchyybelle,self.happy,1642572440

happy,The Story of How A Single Mother of Two Fell For Another Woman!,"My ex husband and I were high school sweethearts. We married in 2004 and our boys were born in 2008/2012. A year after welcoming our second son, I learned he had been cheating on me. I attempted to work it out for the sake of our children but he had other plans and abandoned all of us for a short term fling. 

I was granted sole custody of our boys and moved us all into my parents home. Occasionally, my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity. I reconnected with a group of high school girlfriends, and after 13 years, they obviously had made lots of new connections since we last met up as a group, so nearly every outing I was meeting new people and making new friends. 

During one of our outings, I was seated next to a very tall woman whom I had not met before. She stood out because at 5’11, I had been accustomed to being the tallest person in the group. Our first meeting didn’t go very well. She was quite and standoffish towards me. I felt that I was the only person in the room that she didn’t care for. I later found out that she didn’t care for me initially either, she thought I was overly bubbly and fake!

One night, we all met up again but this time the tall woman and I connected. I learned that she was the VP of a medium sized company and that she had worked her way up from the CEOs personal assistant to his number two executive. The company was based in Southern California, where I lived at the time, but her position was based out of New York and she essentially split her time between each coast, meaning she had developed a friend group in both cites (NYC/LA). I was beyond impressed and became even more intrigued. Subsequently, I learned she was only a year older than me, yet she had never been married and had no children.

We exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. I figured that I had just made another friendship, but this one felt different. She was so down to earth and didn’t gossip about others the entire night, which was a breath of fresh air. She seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person I wanted to befriend during a period where I was already under enough stress and anxiety.

We soon started meeting up, just the two of us, and I learned even more about her personal life. She revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just six years old. She had come out of the closet years ago but had never had a serious relationship. A spouse and kids were something she always wanted, but she felt it may never happen. I consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years.

Within just a few months of knowing each other, we became best friends. We did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with my boys (who quickly came to adore her) and to give me some rest time. I somehow didn’t realize it at the time, but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own.

It was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me. She told me that she didn’t want it to change our relationship, but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind. I awkwardly told her that I needed to think about it. Quickly, I saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad. I started to think about everything in my head at that moment. Deep down, I had developed feelings for her as well. It was all just so confusing to me. I had never been into another woman like that and besides her, I could not find another woman ‘attractive’ even if I wanted to. 

I thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys. Looking at her sad face, I grabbed her arm and told her that I wanted to be more than friends. Her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight. I told her to ask me out. She did and we went on our first date the next evening.

Things only got better from that point on. Our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news. She held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that I was her girlfriend. I thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me. That’s when I realized that we were probably going to get married. I had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here I was on the verge of being married to one. 

She proposed on our one year anniversary. We married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later. The boys and I moved cross country to be with her and I quickly became pregnant. We welcomed our first daughter nine months after the wedding. Since then, we’ve welcomed six more daughters and I have an eighth in my belly as we speak! Six years ago, my wife was promoted to CEO of her company. Despite holding such a powerful position, she always puts plenty of time aside for the kids and myself. I am beyond proud of her and honestly just honored to be able to do life with such an amazing person. 

I must say that I don’t even see or think about her gender anymore. It’s all pure love. We are soulmates. It’s a type of love and emotion I never felt with a guy and sure wouldn’t ever feel with any other woman. I love her for her and that’s the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart!",joellealwyn_82,self.happy,1647766182

I'm a 39 yo female.
I has many problems : self esteem issue, weight issues,met multi traffic accident within last 2 years. ( my eyes 's sight are very weak at night ).Adhd killed my savings.

I always feel so much emptiness in my life, for almost every days.
Until i met someone. 
Eventhough i read alot of books, watched lot of movies, i cant imagine there will be some one , can accept me as who i am, including my flaws.
I cant believe someone can love me as my mom did . 
This is the first time i can feel how it 's like when being needed .
To the world, he is just a single dad. He got a messy hair, worried eyes,tired body .
But i bet many one would be stunned when knowing how brave he is , when being born in a crowded family, and being ignored , yet he still managed to grown up with full kindness in heart.
Even being manipulated and took granted by his ex, he is still believe in good women.
Despite of our differences, i feel that we re so similar at some points.


There are so many reasons for us to give up hope. 
But maybe need only one reason for each of us to keep up and trying . That is love.
I just hope that everyone can believe that, we will be ok in the end. And there is still hope in this world for us .

For the past decade, I was earning, I was okay but felt burn out from the everyday life I have. Because time is such an expensive matter to buy, and it seems like work is taking your life away from you. The good news is last year, I bumped into lead generation business model, I signed up for a course, took mentorship programs, worked for my sites in 3 months while still at work, my 5th month of lead gen I had results, I was earning a small amount of good money. On my 6th month, I resigned and focus on lead gen until this day, gave me the freedom of time and financial ability no other jobs or other business have ever gave me in the past. So today if you are feeling down and a little tired with work,  go try checking lead gen biz model, it'll change your life. :)",fierywaterr,self.happy,1647676437

I roll my window down and asked if he could hear my music, he shook his head no, so I turned it up. (I currently have a rental while my car is in the shop, I thought maybe the system was louder outside even though it wasn't that loud inside, I dunno the car 🤷🏼‍♀️) 

A HUGE smile broke out on his face and this dude breaks into DANCE! I had to get out and join him 😁 We got a bunch of funny looks from the other patrons, but we didn't care, we were having a blast 😁 We both tried to mimic the actual dance a few times, but neither of us could remember most if it 😅

happy,"Hey Redditors! The first film I directed premieres this Thanksgiving on Amazon, iTunes, Google Movies, select theaters and more!","Hey Redditors! My film premieres on Thanksgiving on Amazon and in select theaters! Hello neighbors! My name is Ricky Borba, and I’m a film director. This Thanksgiving my second film, Hope for the Holidays, will debut on Amazon, iTunes, Google movies, YouTube movies, and iScreening Room. Earlier this year, my first film, My Brothers’ Crossing, was in theaters nationwide right before theaters were shut down. 

Here is a link to the trailer: 
https://youtu.be/1RrF4R7uJoE

Hope For the Holidays is a film I began working on in 2017. It stars Oscar Nominated and Golden Globe winning actors and actresses. The basic story is that a mother, played by Sally Kirkland, finds out she has cancer. Her son, played by George Stults, goes into panic mode and decides to rob a bank to pay for her medical bills. He gets caught, goes to prison, and the rest of the film is a race against time for him to see his mother one last time before she passes away, IF he can get out of prison.

This is where things get really personal and beautiful for me. Yes, beautiful. Just two months later, that July, my own mother called to tell me she had Stage IV cancer, and she died just 7 weeks after finding out. My mother and I were as close as a son and mother could be, so this was incredibly difficult.

However.

With the permission of the original writer of the script and the producer, I was able to almost completely rewrite the character played by Sally Kirkland, to say in the film, the same exact things my mom told me on her seven-week battle with cancer. Without exception, almost every scene in the film, Sally's character Georgia is saying verbatim, what my mom said in real life. 

It was a truly cathartic and beautiful way for me to honor my mother. To direct a film, my first film at the time, about the story of a mother and son, a mother who has cancer and wants to see her son one more time. I feel truly blessed and thankful that I was able to honor my mother this way, and that is one of the many reasons I can't wait for you to see this film. It's my hope that it encourages and inspires you, and at the same time is a film that you agree is made with excellence.

So please give it a watch this holiday season and let me know what you think. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",borbafett1,self.happy,1606092418

happy,I'm so happy this year I can finally give gifts to those I love ♡,"A couple years ago I was living off $20 a week after paying rent with my friend, I was jobless (visa issue), the money I received was from my mum back in the UK. 

After returning home to the UK I started going to school and working part time for minimum wage. I started taking the correct steps to get my visa that would allow me to work, and saved up all the money I got to do so..

So many people helped me during the times I was jobless or saving up to create a life I wanted.. my best friend, my mum, I'm forever grateful. 

Now I'm able to work an above minimum wage job back in Canada, doing well this time! I'm so, so beyond happy that I'm able to spoil everyone I love (I never could before!!!) I never came from money, my mum did her best and I'm forever grateful for this, I know what it's like to struggle week to week and giving back is making me tear up, as I'm decorating gift boxes and cards I'm thankful to all of those who were in my life throughout all of my struggles and making them feel happy with a surprise is making me ecstatic.

I've never been able to comfortably afford to buy ANYONE gifts before, I cant put into words just how happy it makes me to be able to give gifts I just cant get over it.. I cant believe I'm able to do this! 

I know this is random but I'm sooooo happy I could cry and I just had to let it put because I am bursting!!!",misuinu,self.happy,1606068307

happy,I am so happy!!! Today I officially left school for good. I did my 12th grade like I was meant to do and I love the me that finished it,"When I was 17 I got a very deep depression and had to leave school due to bullying. 

with alot of therapy and my mom help I got into the night school to complete the 9th grade. Did 2 years and I finished it all except for math. Had to do another year in another school just for that.

Then I decided to do night school again for the 12th grade for 3 years. It was the time of it.

I went to literal hell in this past years for it and never felt better.

I had to deal with a narcisistic mother, a family that blamed me for something nasty I didn't ask for, , a suicide attempt, losing jobs I wanted, unemployment, had to deal with idiots, my own depression that still makes me stay in the couch all day, and a freaking pandemic. 

This school year my job let me go and I decided to go get my yearly social security checks and stay home to study and rest. 

I almost failed the second year but turned it around and was actually the 1st one to finish everything. This year I made question of doing the same.

Had an intership also that I finished with a 17 score!
And the lady of the intership told me I might get a 9 month internship in another hotel cause she sees me with a great future! 


Did 2 school events with my class but I got to take the rains (misspelled I know xp)


6 years ago I was depressed and didn't left my house and never thought I could do much. 

Now I am 24 and feel like I can do almost anything I put my mind into and I an in therapy and trying to be the best me I can be. My next battle will be losing weight and move out! :)",r-ism,self.happy,1624579559

Im very happy and not looking for any recommendations on how to make friends but I really only have reddit to share this with to be honest and I am really feckn proud of myseld so have to out this out in the world. I left school early but I have always been a hard worker. In my 20s I worked very hard and saved for me and my two boys. I focused on the industry I was in and looked for ways to make a future for us in this industry. I got myself two QQI's over the last 3 years which are like education awards in Ireland. Anyway , lads, I finished my first degree today! My first bloody degree. I have achieved something that will look great on a cv and I did it. I studied, I was exhusted in the nights after work and getting home and feeding the kids, taking to them, playing board games and putting them to bed but I just did it. I did it every night for two years. I studied and excellent and I could not be prouder of myself..

happy,Cooked For Myself For the First Time I Feel So Accomplished Right Now!!,"25F So I have never been so enthusiastic to cook in the past and also didn't have anyone to truly show me my dad was always working so I have always been buying premade foods or making simple stuff like grilled cheese that was around the house. For a long time I have always wanted to try to cook, but I have always been so intimated by recipes and feeling like I can never cook that or this... So I decided the other day I wanted to start simple nothing crazy like a four course meal that would be serves at a 5 star restaurant with a complicated recipe. So I decided I wanted to try and cook roasted root veggies it just sounded so good. Plus also a healthy snack/lunch to bring to work with me &lt;3

Ingredients used: Gold Potatoes, zucchini, baby carrots, mushrooms 

Cut all into 1 inch sizes and mixed with extra virgin olive oil with a little bit of salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.

I really wanted to share I don't have many people in my life to talk about this accomplishment I made today I am so happy I cant stop smiling I am so proud of myself and I proud to myself that **I CAN do this WHEN I MAKE IT SO!!** I know this isn't the most crazy and extravagant recipe and it may not mean anything to anyone besides myself, but I am so proud of myself that I did this today and I wont lie I am a little emotional because I never thought I could do something like this. I am just so proud of myself all together and want to keep going. Sorry if this is long but I wanted to share. It tastes so yummy and I cant wait to make this again and maybe try other versions &lt;3 &lt;3

I was skinny-fat my whole life, and was extremely ashamed of my body, to the point where although I lived right next to the sea, I would refrain from going since I had to show my skin. I have tried exercising my whole life, but never stuck to a routine and always ended up quitting after a few weeks as soon as my motivation dwindled. 

I subconsciously always felt embarrassed about not even being able to do a single proper push-up, and  I knew I was disappointing my dad who was a man who grew up in the USSR where being able to do muscle ups at 15 years old was the norm. I had very low self esteem 

However, I am happy to say that I finally managed to persevere and stuck to a routine for the last 6 months, even keeping a clean diet during the process. What was different this time it’s that I finally had access to a gym, where I could surround myself with like-minded people having the same goals as me. Weight training has made me stronger to the point where I could do dozens of push-ups as well as multiple pull-ups, which I was never able to do before.

Even for months after starting to exercise regularly, I still was too embarrassed to show my body, and often times didn’t go to party’s with friends if they involved a pool. 

However, today was the first day where I looked myself in the mirror and saw real progress, and smiled at myself proudly. I felt a lot of energy and motivation , seeing how far I’ve come.

I messaged one of them and we both made clear that we have no ill feelings toward each other and wished each other the best. 
I finally am realizing that I do not need to beat myself up over this anymore. Forgiveness is such a part of self-love, toward other people but most importantly yourself.

happy,"I collect WWII medals. Somehow, I was able to return long lost medals back to the wife and family of the veteran."," I collect Polish medals from World War II. I got my first big bulk of my collection from an estate sale, but I have been slowly collecting them on eBay over the years. Several years ago, I came across a really neat set of the 1939-1945 Star (with the miniature uniform medal), the Italian Star, and documentation from the Polish government in exile awarding them to the veteran with name, date of birth, etc. It was a complete set. Maybe 6-7 years ago, I posted on some random military history message board asking if they could look the veteran up by name to see if they had any type of history on him, so maybe I could learn his story. I found out some basic information about his service and demographic information like his parents names and where he was born, and that's it. I carefully stored them in my collection and looked at them every so often.

Earlier this year, I got emails notifying me of private messages on that message board that I haven't thought about in years. Someone claiming to be the granddaughter of the veteran, and that their grandmother (veteran's wife) was researching his name online and found that I had his medals here in the United States. I thought it was a scam, but I provided them with my email. They were able to send me verification that they were in fact the family of the veteran. They were asking to buy the medals back from me, I told them that I'll give them the medals back in exchange for just telling me his story, which they did. They even sent me a few copies of his handwritten notes from the war, and copies of photographs from before, during, and after the war.

The medals finally found their way home, and they sent me a picture of the widow with [her husband's medals](https://i.imgur.com/DWt2v2Q.jpg). This is such an unbelievable story, I am thankful to have been part of this. We still don't know how the medals ended up here in the United States.",Zarski843,self.happy,1635026857

happy,"The guy I really, really like just told me that he has a crush on me!","I can't describe how I feel right now, but I think this is the happiest I've ever felt!

Since we're both a bit shy, we ended up confessing to eachother through music!

On my to visit home yesterday, I sent him a song that reminded me of him, and last night, as we were saying goodnight he sent me Beautiful brain by Mabel Ye and told me it reminded him of me! I listened to and realised but was still unsure and nervous, so this morning I sent him Day 1 by Honne as a reply and after listening to it he told me that he has a crush on me!

We met a month ago, which is quick I know, but we've been living as university flatmates.
As soon as we started hanging out, I started to feel something for him, and despite only knowing him for a short while - he's amazing and wonderful and so kind!

We bake together and he makes me dinner, he spoon fed me some while I was washing up,
He listens to Christmas songs with me while baking just because they make us happy,
We have so much in common and so many differences at the same time! But I feel like I've learnt so many new things from him,
When he felt a drop of rain while we were walking, he pulled my hood for me without a word,
He let's me cuddle into him while watching movies and does the same to me - when I fell asleep on his shoulder he didn't move at all,
One of my flatmates started getting mad at me for something, but he stood up for me and defended me!

We talk everyday, and even when we're not physically together, we always text eachother!
He's made me feel more safe, comfortable and happy than anyone ever has!

He's typing right now, so I'll have to leave this here! We're just two shy people that like each other a lot!",babeforconspiracies,self.happy,1634901228

From the first time I ever stepped foot on this campus, I immediately felt like I had found a new home - a place where I'd foster professional and social relationships to last a lifetime, where I'd prepare myself for life beyond college, and where I'd grow as an individual. As I sit here 3 and a half years later, with the end in sight, I find myself reflecting on these expectations and believe that I've lived that out to its full extent. I've had good times and bad, I've made mistakes and had big successes, and I've experienced happiness and sadness. In the end though, I grew with each experience and believe that when graduation comes along in June, I will look back on my time here, content with everything I gave and everything that this school gave me. I expected this school to be a place I'd love but at the end of the day I found it to be a place I loved that loved me back and gave me everything it could.",bandito692,self.happy,1634852132

happy,I was finally able to get contact lenses today,"I went to the eye doctor about a month ago hoping to get contact lenses. There’s a “class” you have to go through to get them. They want you to fit the lens in your eye and be able to remove them before they approve you for contacts. Make sure they are in your eye correctly, and you don’t damage your eye taking them out. I spent an hour last month trying to get one in and I couldn’t do it. My blink reflex is too strong. I got frustrated and just settled for glasses.

I really didn’t want glasses again. I got hit in the face at work and mine broke and were being held together with tape and epoxy. I’m tired of them getting dirty, then trying to clean them on the spot and having to deal with either new scratches or smudges and still not being able to see. I hate the Sun being in my eyes coming home from work in the morning and not being able to wear sunglasses unless I paid $400-$600 for a name brand prescription pair. I’m tired of frames being in my field of vision and having to move my head more to see correctly. I really wanted to get away from glasses.

Few hours later after the disappointment wore off I called and made an appointment again for a month later to try again. That leads to today and I was able to get them in this time. And it was amazing. I could see actually better than I could with my new glasses. I didn’t have frames in the way. I didn’t have specks of dust to look through. Everything was actually clear. Without glasses. I couldn’t stop smiling. It was amazing being able to see without glasses. Being able to actually scratch beside my eye whereas before I’d have to be mindful of my glasses to not touch them and put a mark on them and make that spot blurry. I just couldn’t stop smiling. I’m still smiling. I haven’t been able to see without glasses this clearly since I was a child. It’s just an amazing feeling to me. I don’t really have anyone to share this with but I wanted to share with someone. I’m so happy I don’t have to deal with glasses as much anymore.",ReaperOne,self.happy,1634832347

Some guys came up to me and tried to hit on me, but I told them I wasn’t interested and that I was just vibing tonight, and they were super respectful and didn’t push me. We danced to a variety of 2000s hits, and when I left, they gave me a hug and said “it’s nice to meet you!” And they let me go on my merry way. 


I’m so happy because I was scared about people (men) being creepy, but when I told them I didn’t want to dance, they didn’t try to force it. When there was a group of more aggressive guys that came up, the girls of the group surrounded me and protected me from them.

I’m so thankful that there are good people in this world still, when it feels like there’s so much bad stuff. ❤️",floatingm,self.happy,1637456763
happy,"I sent my Switch Lite to a person with mixed reviews so I could get it reskinned, and after having it be delayed by the mailing service, it arrived on my front porch according to USPS. It wasn't there. A surprisingly happy ending. ;_;","I was panicking. The game I preordered had arrived on my front porch yesterday, and I was counting down the seconds until I could play a revamped form of my childhood on my Switch Lite. I checked around my house and even checked my neighbors' porches from afar in the winter cold, looking stupid in my pajamas and flip-flops. 

Like a maniac, I ran for my keys and sped through my neighborhood so I could catch the mail truck. I prayed that it hadn't left yet. 

It hadn't.

I was nervous that the USPS driver wouldn't be nice about it, considering I looked deranged already chasing her down, but she was. I apologized for disrupting her route, and I explained the situation. She was all smiles and was ready to help me. She thought about it and realized she must've dropped it at the house next to mine by mistake, and she said that she'd drive back to go get it for me. 

I figured she would do it when she was finished with her route in my neighborhood, but nope, she followed after me and approached my neighbor's house. She was taking a while, so I was scared for a moment that her hunch was incorrect or my neighbor wouldn't hand it over. 

My neighbor indeed brought my package in his house, and thankfully, I saw the mailwoman leave his house with my package in her hands. I thanked her multiple times for her going above and beyond and apologized again for the trouble I had her endure over my silly package.

When I got home, my Switch Lite was working and was indeed perfectly reskinned. 

I've been having a rough week at work and was considering changing my career altogether. It was like nothing was going right in my life, and I felt stupid - that the worst thing to end the week was that I couldn't play a game. I knew it was stupid to feel that way, but I was still hurt over it in the moment. 

But the mailwoman's kindness has relit my optimism in my life, and I'm incredibly thankful to her and the person who did the meticulous reskinning for my Switch Lite.",Chirachii,self.happy,1637452703

I somewhat recently graduated. So much happened in college that delayed my life and my 4 year education turned into a 6 year education. I’ve been feeling like a failure, that I’m 24 and still am doing nothing with my life. I always felt like a disappointment to my fiancée and my family. 

I applied for a job within my field 3 weeks ago and scored an interview. The interview went well, and I looked more into the job and it turned into a dream job and something I really wanted. I had a second interview for the job coming and it was going to be a 2 hour, intensive interview. I prepared like mad for it, I went to work every day and then came home and prepared and then went to bed. Then the interview came and I killed it, and I was on to the third interview. Again, I really wanted this and I prepared and prepared and prepared. Went to the interview, killed it. 

I got the call yesterday that I GOT THE JOB! $60,000 a year right out of college, tons of benefits, and I get to work a wonderful job helping people and following my dream of actually participating in litigation. 

Beyond the money and everything else, my family is so proud of me, my fiancée is so proud of me, and I have never felt more pride in myself. I am absolutely glowing and nothing can knock me off the cloud I’m on right now.",Wrastling97,self.happy,1637424007

happy,My son said I should not work and that it is his time to do the turns. I am a single mother who has worked hard under great odds. I am thrilled and I want to shout out my happiness.,"Struggled a lot with ADHD and by being a very gullible person, all alone. Only my mother's side family was supportive. 

I worked hard against all odds. Indian society is still bad for divorcees. I had been physically abused for 9 years by my ex. But people still wanted me to take the abuse. Perhaps they wanted me killed!. People around never saw that I had escaped abuse but were free to accuse me of so many things. No one lifted their little finger for me. I was self-sufficient because of my hard work. I worked from 7 am to 9 pm and also on weekends. 

Despite this, I met with many accusations. I was very busy, minding my own business, and being self-sufficient. Money was scarce. But somehow I could manage everything.

People laughed at me. Sure I should have come off as funny, what with my ADHD and innate gullibility. Plus, poverty is a bitch. Nobody likes poor people. All this hurt me a lot. 

But what they did not see is I was picking up a lot of skills. I am quite good at music too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But  I remember this particular colleague who cared not for my money or status and spend hours listening to my sobs. The one person who had stood by me.

&amp;#x200B;

People who are struggling. Do not get pulled down by people who discourage you. Identify others' jealousy. Think logically and love yourself. I had never been confident enough to think logically. I feel that when we are met by negativity, we should know that it is the tree that is laden with fruits that gets HIT a lot. So know your worth. I was bogged down by people's accusations. I wish I had not taken all of them to heart and could have enjoyed my life with my son and mother, in a better manner. Lost years, unfortunately. Today my achievements have made people shut. 

 Now, people say that I am a good mother. Some relate to the times when my kid had gone out of the way to help them.  Today he is  25-years-old and earns a lot. ( He studied at one of the best institutes in my country). Suddenly a lot of people have become friendly.

happy,"I'm a child free male. I met a neighbourhood kid, and together we achieved the City Gold Medal in his science fair project.","I've lived in my house like a hermit for about half a decade. My the grace of God, I found a women who understands me and loves me. Further miracles were involved to convince her to move to another country to live with me. She attracts people, I don't. 

While outside one day just before covid, a couple of neighbors saw us walking our dog outside our house. The kids ran over to meet the dog, and spark a conversation.

Turns out, the mom is a single mother looking after two boys and is desperate for some help to look after her boys while she works. Well my fantastic girlfriend, now fiancé, volunteered to look after them for a few hours a day to give mom some peace. For free, no strings, just have to put up the odd prayer and scripture quote. Some might turn their nose up at this, but it went over well. 

Turns out one of the boy has a science fair project coming up. My time to shine. I said man, I have more spare parts and projects in my garage than Nicola Tesla. Including several Tesla Coils, and enough blow torches and fuel to melt Antarctica. 

The kids eye were wide when he saw my shop. 

As a hobby, I work with metals, so I had some bismuth laying around. I showed him the crystal properties of it thinking it would blow his mind. Turns out, the kid was way more interested in how fast I melted a pound of Bismuth. I threw a general blowtorch on it and made a puddle in 30 seconds. HOW CAN A METAL SO HEAVY MELT SO FAST!? His growing brain had a hard time with that. 

So, we improvised an experiment that measured the speed of melt from various sources of heat. Bismuth has a very low melting point, so you can put a chunk of it in a pan on a regular stove and melt quickly. It's honestly a super underrated material, excellent conductor as well. 

Anyway, we submitted the experiment to his school/city for the science fair. We received the gold medal. 

As a previous hermit, without my fiancé, I wouldn't have met this kid, and wouldn't have impacted his life as I have. 

Still don't want kids, but I get to flex parenting skills every couple of weeks when they come over.

happy,Celebrating one year of sobriety today 🙏🏻,"365 Days 😌 
One whole year free from alcohol!

One whole year of waking up without a hangover, shakes, or “hair of the dog”. Looking in the mirror and recognizing myself. Remembering what I did, who I saw, what I said, and how I responded to everything.

One whole year of feeling all of my emotions instead of being numb. I no longer have panic attacks or crying spells. No more future tripping or dwelling on the past. I no longer feel the need to numb my pain. This year I have experienced victories and traumas and didn’t need to drink over any of it. 

One whole year of setting boundaries with myself and with others. Saying no when I need to instead of people pleasing. Recognizing unhealthy behaviors in myself and slowly but surely correcting them. No more gaslighting or abusive relationships. No more feeling alone in a room full of people. 

One whole year of exploring things I love instead of daydreaming about what I could be doing. I have so many hobbies and interests. Every day I’ve been learning and loving myself a little more than the day before. 

A year ago, my body was physically dependent on alcohol, and my mind and soul were so sick. I didn’t want to be alive anymore. Now in sobriety I can truly say I’m grateful to be alive. I have a new flame in my heart, I pray to talk to it and I meditate to listen to it. I have met so many wonderful people along this journey and I’m so grateful for everyone who has supported me in sobriety. I’m so damn happy 😃

I experienced high energy where I felt jumpy and kept moving around the house, I became so curious about everything, I felt confident and felt like I was at the top of the world. I had many plans, I felt like I was the greatest person alive where I helped a lot who had problems. I was very curious about the stories of everyone, helped people though, their family problems, heartbreaks, depression etc. I was so obsessed on knowing everything about myself. My personality, my future, my values, my dreams, my motivations. I felt so excited and nervous about my future which made my head hurt. I had many ideas and theories such as; what is on the edge of the universe, the existence of everything, how Christianity might disappear from the future, aliens, extraterrestrial beings. I even had plans of becoming a famous philosopher or being a therapist who saves people from suicide. I wrote a lot on my journal.

&amp;#x200B;

**During my extreme lows:**

&amp;#x200B;

Everything started going down, I lost energy and started sleeping more than 12 hours a day, my extreme happiness and excitement was replaced with sadness, feelings of being unlovable, hopeless. I forgot everything about me, who I was as a person, my dreams, basically everything about me and I felt empty. I started to question if I should still continue my life or not and I had suicidal thoughts. I isolated from everyone and stopped attending online classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I recovered and what I have learned from my problems:**

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I figured out who were the people who were truly there for me, my friends noticed that I haven't been talking to them anymore and that I wasn't attending online classes. They started messaging and calling me a lot to ask me if I was okay. This was when I told them everything. I also started telling my grandmother and other relatives. The amount of support I got was a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

They reminded me of who I was and thanked me for everything, told me that I would always bring out the best in them, inspire them, help them trough their heartbreaks, family problems, by being a good listener and giving advice. They said that I was smart, empathetic, open-minded, never judged people, soft-hearted. A relative of mine who was a psychologist even told me that she admires me for my emotional intelligence, kindness, and self-awareness, my great ability to read and see through people at the age of 15. I was told to continue my dreams of being a therapist where I could inspire and save others and brighten their day.

&amp;#x200B;

My highs have given me a lot of insights about a lot of stuff due to the racing thoughts I had. I know what its like to be so happy and excitable where you feel like you are on the top of the world and feel like you can do anything and that life will be all good and happy. I felt anxiety where you would jump into different possibilities and felt uneasy due to the uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

My lows made me experience depression which is a thing many are experiencing, I know what its like to feel like you are unlovable and alone. I know what its like to struggle and try so hard to get out of bed to do anything, get frustrated because you cant concentrate and finish anything. Depression makes you feel like you are sinking in a dark bottomless pit while you start to forget everything about yourself, it tricks you into believing that nobody loves you and that you are alone and life will only get worse for you.

&amp;#x200B;

It helped me empathize with people better because it enabled me to feel emotions strongly and deeply. It has given me an ambition to be a therapist and help other people who are struggling too because I know what its like to feel like you are in a rollercoaster of emotions. It made me realize that our struggles are what makes us strong and resilient. My struggles made a huge impact on me into becoming resilient and emotionally intelligent. I can use my story to let others know that in the darkest moment of our life, there is light, there is hope, and that our problems are what makes us human and strong. We may feel like we are alone, but there are many others out there who are struggling too. I look forward into growth, maturity, and more intelligence.",Dulapeep321,self.happy,1637154456

happy,A stranger on the beach just gave me money to buy ice creams for the group of young people I was with and walked away,"I'm an Italian volounteer working in France for an association that helps young people without family to get indipendent.

They're mostly migrants from Africa and Arab countries that need housing, getting regular documents to legally stay in the country, finish their studies and find a work.

Due to Covid we didn't do many activities and we were left with some extra budget, so we decided to spend it for a trip, and yesterday we brought them to the beach. We were a dozen: seven teenagers from several african countries, three from Pakistan, me, and an educator. As soon as we arrived we immediately went into the water.

Me, being a little thin and suffering the cold from the water more than other people, got out earlier than the others and went back where we left our stuff. Not a minute after I got there, a guy came to me asking something. It went like that:

Him: Are you supervising that group there? (pointing at my young ones playing in the water)

Me: Yes

At that point I expected some kind of bad remark. And instead.

Him: We are leaving tomorrow, and I wanted to give you this to spend for getting them ice creams

And he lent me a 50 euros banknote. I didn't really know what to reply on the spot, and just told him a ""thank you"", very surprised. He didn't wait for more, and just left. He had his towel a little further, he packed his stuff, was joined by who I guess were his wife and daughter, and went away.

He didn't ask if I was working for some association, who the young ones I was supervising were, nothing. He didn't even wait for giving the money when everyone was present. He just made this selfless act and departed.

On the way back we bought everyone ice creams and I ended the day with a really great feeling. I think it was the nicest, most spontaneous thing I ever happened to see from someone.",NibaTCat,self.happy,1630077229

happy,BIRTHDAY birthday just get happy about living another year please,"Birthday

Have had a plan to celebrate my birthday this week to make up for the fact I didn’t have a proper 21st, and I don’t want to drunk text my friends and think this appreciation is only out of being under the influence. But I just want everyone to know having friends who genuinely support you and want to see you succeed is so amazing. I NEED the best for all of my friends period. Knowing I have the support from them as well in whatever venture I take is so heartwarming. 

Get friends who are confident and are confident in you. 

It’s so nice being at peace with yourself knowing you have a group of people who want the best for eachother. It takes a while to find these people but cherish it. I used to never see a point to life and wanted to end it all for the longest amount of time because I didn’t see a point… and I can see where people come from in hopelessness, give it time you will find your people. You will find your group that all supports eachother. You will find meaning to keep going, you may not find the reason but you will find why and who to keep going for to support them and to have them support you is amazing. Just give it TIME. I really never thought I would find this point in my life but man does it feel amazing to regret every single negative thought about life I ever had. I hope everyone finds this. I want everyone to reach this point of appreciation towards who they have in their life.

happy,I developed a happiness tracker from my personal experience!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

happy,My boyfriend and I are on homecoming court!!,"This afternoon my boyfriend (17M) and I (17F) found out we would be on our schools homecoming court, and it felt so surreal! I had to keep looking at the announcement post over and over to make sure I wasn’t dreaming! For some context, we’re both seniors and were one of four couples most voted out of around 12+ couples! It makes me really happy, because I’m a shy, mostly introverted kid, and I have a lot of social anxiety, and it’s just really good to have a sort of…validation from my peers, you know? Although I also owe a lot of it to my boyfriend, he’s really outgoing and charming, I don’t think I could’ve ever gained the confidence to do this without him! I’m super excited for the homecoming game now, I’m determined to make my senior year the best yet!

It’s funny too, we were supposed to find out who was on the court last Friday, but due to technical issues (they left one of the couples off the ballot) and ties (apparently four couples tied for second place! Isn’t that crazy?!) we had to revote today! I was anxious my entire class after voting, but it felt so good to see our names there!

If you don’t mind me getting mushy, I really appreciate my boyfriend a lot and am so excited to get to do this with him. We both had really bad previous relationships, and it was something we bonded over. He treats me so well, he likes to show me off, is always loving to me, and I can tell him anything! I can’t express just how much I appreciate him, because I really do. He even bought me a froggy bucket hat that he gave me earlier today!

The day I got the offer letter was one of the happiest of my entire life. I became the most successful person in my entire family overnight. I had a single mother who treated me like shit. I was depressed. My life got better after I got clean, and it was far more challenging and rewarding than I could've ever imagined. A week after I got the job, I met a beautiful sweet girl and I felt like I won the jackpot twice in one month.

Work was insane for the first 2 months. It ground me down to a shell of who I was just a few weeks before. This week I finished a massive project I've been working on since I started. So excited about it.

No one and nothing can ever stop me from achieving my dreams. Every single thing I've ever done professionally has been a success.

My greatest wish is to be able to pass these skills and opportunities down to someone else in need. Someone at the very bottom of our world like I was with the potential to do better. And when their time comes, I wish for them to pass it on too.",its4thecatlol,self.happy,1632459291

To some this may sound these are normal for someone to do or to have but they arent for me. For so long i was avoiding my mental issues and I havent been happier for going to therapy, I was so scared at first, but my therapist opened my eyes to so many things. I am truly grateful.

happy,Today was my last therapy appointment and I am so proud of myself and so thankful for my therapist,"

I've already experience with therapy but during rona, with no job, university at home, fearing my partner might get ill, no seeing friends anymore, no going out and so on, depression and eating disorder came back. I decided to get help in summer last year and first it got worse. I really feard I might never get better. 

And now here I am. A few month ago we changed to a two week schedule, had a three week schedule a few times and it was completely fine. I had a lot to talk about but rather about new exciting good stuff, than therapy themes. We even finished the last three appointments after only 20 minutes because there was just nothing to therapy anymore. And it felt better and better. 

I had to use recovery records (app for eating disorders where you log in every meal, feeling and thoughts and your therapist can read it) and since quite a while I felt rather annoyed about it and forgot a few times because it just didn't take up my mind anymore. For the last month we went without it and I felt so free and happy and good again.

She asked me if there were some things that got to less time or if I am afraid about certain things in the future and when I said I would liked to dig into my childhood a bit deeper she said ""But this is something you could do on your own, too. You're so strong and smart you've learnt so much, you're completely capable of dealing with this"" and this made me to proud and a bit teary-eyed.

I am truly happy and so thankful. She is an awesome therapist and the first who really fully helped me. I feel confident and strong and I am excited for the future.

TL;DR : today was my last therapy appointment and I am so happy, I feel thankful and strong and ready for the future.",Whysocomplicat3d,self.happy,1632437628

happy,It just feels nice to finally belong! (Mental Health related),"I lived most of my life believing and feeling bad for being very different from the rest. Growing up, and even up until now, I was labeled and treated as a monster for acting the way I do by my blood relatives. Before I learned of my values, I was very toxic, but they are not without fault. They were the reason why I developed mental illnesses in the first place. 

I spent some years wallowing in my misery that I can never *belong*, and being a social butterfly didn't help me because that meant I didn't belong to any group, though I was made to feel and *was* welcomed. My 2020 was a horrible year - not just because COVID broke out. But this year, I've been actively looking for communities I can relate to and one community I finally feel belonged is the mental health community.

It also helps that the Chinese MMORPG I'm playing has many wonderful people I can call friends. We're all part of one Discord server. I've also made friends with quite a lot of them and I talk to these people on a regular basis - both in game and off game. I've also been able to have a few phone calls and group calls here and there. Despite hard and trying times in my life right now, not just because it's still COVID, I'm really enjoying this season. *I finally belong!*",influencerwannabe,self.happy,1632422574

happy,I'd been planning to make a self-love course for months and it's finally out!,"Hello everyone! Happy World Gratitude Day!

I’ve spent the last few months thinking over the last few years of my life trying to figure out what could’ve helped me deal with my problems and saved me from those tough times of having a body disorder, bouts with mild depression, and just severe self-critique. And, could it be something that would be helpful universally?

I figured out one thing that was common between everyone who I’d seen struggle a lot, and it was the poor health of the relationship that they had with themselves. I heard my friends talk about themselves so cruelly and it broke my heart because what I would say to them would be the stark opposite of it. But, then I realized that was how I would talk to myself too. We were all hateful to ourselves. But, why? It definitely wasn’t helping.

Disclaimer: Shameless plug ahead :P

So, I decided to create a 21-day self-love course that would help people like you and me form a better relationship with ourselves. To help us become our own friends. Even if we can’t control everything that happens to us, we can control how we behave with ourselves through those things. It’s free to take and I just want to share it hoping it can help someone out there because we really do deserve to feel loved, especially by ourselves. I wish you well :)

This came with its challenges as I'd never want to be seen as weak. I want to show that I am good at things which made me extremely competitive.

However, through differences in my outlook on life and my own growth as a person, I am fixing this. I'm so happy that I am seeking help and tutoring for school subjects that I struggle with, and I don't mind how others view me too much. A toxic personality trait that I had in the past was that I hated to lose to a girl in physical sports or activities: armwrestling or soccer or badminton etc.  It's not a trait that I liked to have, but it was ingrained in who I was. I felt so bad and angry in highschool when I lost my position as a golf captain to a girl who just started playing her senior year because she was naturally gifted, and picked up the sport easily, so much so that even after just one season, she was picked for D2 golf in college.


However, today, in a small badminton tournament at school, I was obliterated by this one girl in fast badminton and lost 11-1, and I wasn't pissed off or salty. I had a lot of fun, and vsing her just motivated me to work harder and try to beat her next time. I'm not happy that I lost, but I'm happy that I had the opportunity to vs someone so talented. I'm motivated to work harder and get better. I don't mind being seen as weak anymore. I'm happy being who I am.

happy,I don't want to make any assumptions. But I think my aunt and uncle are starting to see each other again. And that makes me immensely happy,"So, if you look through my post history, I mention that my aunt and uncle separated when I was little after my aunt had a miscarriage. They stayed together for a little while but ended up separating when I was 4 I think. Growing up, they tended to avoid each other whenever possible. But they were never bad to me or anything like that. For example, if the family was together at someone's house for Christmas or whatever, either my aunt or uncle would be there, never the two of them at the same time. Or, if they were both there, they didn't talk to each other and just avoided crossing their paths. Never shouting or yelling or anything like that, just trying to pretend they weren't there.

Fast forward to now. I've said many times in other posts how my uncle has basically become like my dad these past few years, changing drastically for the better from the version of him I grew up knowing. He even has a spot on his dresser in his room that are just photos of him and me from when I was little to now. That's how much he cares about me. And I spent the past weekend with him like I usually do. I woke up Sunday and expected it to just be us for breakfast. But instead, I come down and my aunt is there.

They're just casually chatting about whatever. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing. I legit could not remember the last time they spoke to each other. And here they are making each other laugh. So the three of us had breakfast together and it was nice. It really was. They even said they were planning on spending the day together!

Now, again, I don't mean to make assumptions. But the fact that they're in each other's presence like this makes me giddy. I especially am happy for my uncle since, even though he has me in his life, he lives all by himself (so does my aunt of course but still). And it kills me a little every time I reject his offer to do something together when I have plans with my friends or boyfriend. I genuinely hope something good happens between them",drift_apart_together,self.happy,1632172028

happy,The ONLY thing that works for my chronic back pain...,"Just wanted to share my experience in managing chronic neck and back pain for close to 20 years now. I've tried almost every solution you can think of -- orthopedics, chiropractic, physiotherapists, massage sessions, yoga etc. but nothing ever seemed to work. I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.

The second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.

Hopefully this changes someone's life the way it did for mine :') Cheers, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any other tips!",skyultima,self.happy,1611413639

happy,"My boyfriend is seriously the best guy out there (for me, at least)!","Note: I use the word “we” a lot. I don’t mean to speak for him, it was just the most effective way to write this!


   I just really wanted to tell someone. It’s one of those topics that feel a little too “braggy” to go on about to a friend, so I’ll tell whoever is sorting by new right now! 

   This man treats me with so much love and respect. He makes me feel like I’m the best girlfriend in the world, and I absolutely feel like he’s the best boyfriend. 

   It’s been over 2 years now, and every day he’s constantly doing little things that fill my heart with love. 

   We don’t fight. Red flag? Nope. We’ve never had to fight, because any time one of us has something we feel needs to be discussed, we bring it up in a loving, calm, and collected manner. I feel safe discussing anything and everything with him. Every time, we talk until we reach a place where we each feel heard. Neither of us ever just “roll over” on a subject, we reach a genuine compromise that leaves us content. 

   We’re also semi-long distance for the last year or so.  2 hours apart. Enough to make us miss each other, but thankfully close enough to still see each other in person a couple times a month. While of course I’d like to be closer to him, I truly feel like the distance has made us closer. He gives me feelings of trust that I can’t put into words. 

   I texted him a paragraph explaining a concern I had, and told him that it was totally okay if he’d rather talk about it later, since I was feeling a little sensitive and it was the middle of the day while he was getting things done. Instead of texting me back, he called me. To me, that was a huge act of love of compassion. 

   He could have texted me back about it, or tell me that he’d rather speak on it later. Instead, he took the time to go to a private place so he could hear me out and understand better. Which I liked for a lot of reasons, but especially because it allowed me to truly understand his side as well. 

   It’s just like, in every situation he always either does the objectively “right” thing, or he goes above and beyond. 

   That’s it I guess, I could talk so much more but I’ll leave it there! My heart is full, and I’m really r/happy",possiblyourgf,self.happy,1611354298

happy,"I met my OCD match, and have never been happier: a feel good story.","I (23f) met my partner (27m) at the restaurant we both work at. When I met him, I thought he was some random 17 year old kid who was our new dishwasher. Turned out to be a very young looking 28 year old man who would be joining our prep team. I've always had a thing for gingers. We worked together everyday for a full year, and I really liked how he operated. He was so clean, efficient and amazing at multi tasking. This guy could crush a whole prep list in an hour or so, while the kitchen area was spotless, no dishes and a clean apron. 

There was this one time we went off in a rage of passion about how specific ""crunchies"" should he stored alphabetically, use first on top, refills underneath, with all the tape labels facing the exact same way (on messier chef wasn't putting them away properly) And that was the exact moment I knew I had to have him. I caught myself always staring at him as he went back to his station. Over the weeks and months we ended up closing together and we would walk from downtown towards his parents house, and my apartment, taking me to my door everytime. I know he did it just to make sure I got home safe, but I knew he loved it too. 

I started inviting him in to play Mario games on my wicked gaming setup. We spent the whole summer crushing services and playing video games until 3am most days. Everytime he would leave, I would walk him down and he would say ""I can't believe how late we always end up hanging out"" and after a full year of making sure he was what I wanted, I asked him out.

He hadn't been with anyone for 4 years before me, and was very anxious and vanilla, but having to start from scratch didn't bother me. On our first date while playing jenga at a bar, some kids ran into the restaurant and threw lit firecrackers at the tables in the back. We thought it was gunshots and the restaurant cleared out. It was so scary and intense.. long story short we got free takeout and went home to play video games. I just remember feeling okay if that was the end and we were going to die. I finally got to go out with him.

Another thing I really love about him is how passionate his is about proper recycling, composting and purchasing things in bulk with jars. I watched him today in the recycling bin aisle picking new bins. He was in such deep thought about picking the right ones and kept bouncing ideas off me. I just watched him in awe with  big ol silly grin. It made me giggle and feel warm inside.

Almost 2 year later we now live together in our very labeled apartment. Our favourite activities are putting away groceries and cleaning out the fridge together, reorganizing things in our home, and being the ultimate completion-ists with our video games. He finished Mario odessy with 100% and it was super cute how excited he got when he beat the entire game and all it's moons.

He fills my beside water, makes my bed when I forget, wipes down the calendar and starts the next month 10am on the 1st of the month. He fluffs the pillows on the couch, wipes down the electronics, and cares so much about how the bathroom looks and smells. He gives so much of a fuck about himself, manscapes all his areas to be well groomed, gets haircuts on the dot every 6 weeks (prebooks the next one when he's there) and has an amazing bedtime skin routine. 

We never argue, we communicate our wants, desires and thoughts. He problem solves quickly, goes right to Wendy's for exactly what I would order when I'm pissy on my period. And watching him make  to do list and cross the entire thing off in a few days makes me wetter than the ocean. 

I never ask people to do things for me because 1. I want it done a very specific way and 2. I feel like an asshole trying to explain how and why I want it done that way. Which I can never explain because I want in done that way because I view it as the correct way in my mind. And one day I realized, I truthfully and genuinely trust this person. If I give them a task or ask a favour he will 1. Do it my way or 2. When I tell him I need it done  certain way he doesn't argue and goes ""I understand that"" because he thinks the same way, which makes me feel whole inside.

My past relationships made me feel with my obsessive compulsive disorder I was unlovable. That the way I liked things was unachievable and too high of a standard. People would often compare me to Monica from friends. I like labels on the food in the fridge, first in first out, super clean windows, I always cared about my entire house being ""setup as if surprise guests would be coming over."" I felt like an asshole trying to get people to clean up better, and to give more of a fuck. I had come to terms with the fact I could date for fun, but not for a long term serious relationship. I was told no one would clean up at 3am after a board game night because they were too tired to do the dishes, put the pieces in the correct boxes, and reset the living room.

Until I met you.

You made me feel like I wasn't alone.

I love you.

Always yours,

happy,"I'm anemic, but I've finally gotten my nails to grow a bit!","Usually my nails are really brittle and peely, and they snag and break up to the nail bed constantly. I got tired of it because I love painting my nails, and so I've been taking a slower release iron and some biotin, drinking more water, painting them daily with OPI Nail Envy or Essie Grow Faster, and filing away any trouble spots the second I see them with the most delicate glass file, even on top of the nail. I've also been massaging my cuticles and the nails themselves with oil between painting. (Just an hour or two without paint, more than that = breakage.) 



The result is that my nails, while all are very slightly different lengths, haven't broken yet! I feel so much more feminine. I used to get fake nails occasionally, but the dremel actually hurt on my sad nails, as did the acrylic itself while it was wet; it really burned. Removing them was a nightmare even if they didn't snap part of natural nail off. I usually had to get them done once and then wait until that damage grew completely out to do it again. But no more!



At this point I'm like 2mm past the tip of my fingers on most of them, no pain, and they look much stronger! They don't bend nearly as much, either. I'm so proud! I hope they stay nice.",Wilted_Ivy,self.happy,1611178584

happy,My niece that I helped raise visited me for the first time since starting college!,"So long story short I helped raise my niece after her dad (my older brother) walked out on her and her mom when she was 12. I originally was hesitant about doing it because I was still grieving the loss of my wife years earlier, something I still haven't fully moved on from of course. Me helping raise her were honestly the happiest years of my life. I'm confident in saying she's the daughter I never had and I'm the dad she deserved and needed. I was there for her at her lowest and highest. And letting her go to start college was one of the hardest days in a long time, but I knew she'd be okay. 

We'd been keeping in contact as regularly as possible, texting a couple times a week. And in her absence, I got myself a dog to help with I guess my loneliness, as sad as that sounds (his name's Bullet, btw). He's a Labrador Retriever mix and one of his favorite things is hide and seek. He's as trained as can be and rarely barks at other dogs or people when he's home alone. And obviously coming home to him running up to me never fails to put a smile on my face. 

Anyway, my niece messaged me saying she had a long weekend due to having just finished midterm exams and was going to come over to my place to visit after she saw her mom first (who also was equally there for her, btw). So I'm waiting and waiting and then I hear a car door close in my driveway. I go out and, no surprise, it's her. And the biggest smile imaginable comes across both of our faces as I walk over and we hug each other. And it wasn't one of those hugs you give casually to your parents when you're going somewhere or when you see a good close friend. This was one where we held each other tight, long and didn't say anything. And after I kissed the top of her head hard, the first words I said were ""How's school been, baby?"". 

And she laughs and we head inside. The even bigger surprise was that she hadn't even gone to her mom's yet, she came to see me first. This just melted me. I also brought my dog in from the backyard to see her and she immediately fell in love with him. I remember he kept looking at me like ""Who is this?"" and the more I stood next to her petting him the more comfortable he got. 

We then just sat and talked about school and how everything was going (she's going for Education and wants to teach K-8). Basically, she's made some new friends, is in a club for her major and loves most of her classes. 

My life was obviously less exciting haha, only really telling her I'd been seeing other family members, working from home more, started doing some home renovations, all that. And I actually did manage to reconnect with someone I went to high school with and we met up for the first time a couple weeks ago. 

I also showed her something I never had before. It was a photo of me and my wife at the hospital on the day of my niece's birth, and I let her keep it. Rest of the day we spent with her mom and other family and went out to eat together, watched a movie and other cool and exciting stuff. I'm planning on taking her shooting tomorrow, one of her favorite pastimes. Just her being in my presence makes everything better. I know that sounds vague, but there aren't enough words for how much joy she brings me. 

Just wanted to put this out there and express how I'm feeling currently!",honest_scenario,self.happy,1615688519

happy,"As of today, I'm officially one year sober. And I'll never forget what inspired me to quit in the first place","I was basically a steady drinker in my late 20's, usually getting drunk at least a few times a week and starting off my morning with a beer or mimosa even if I was feeling fancy. And the kicker? I had a kid. My six year old daughter. And my wife who suffered through all of my bullshit. I was a monster with a bottle in his hand, never abusive or mean to them, but quickly going down a health path I was sure I couldn't recover from. 

And one Saturday morning, I woke up with a hangover like nothing I had ever felt. It was like someone had a sledgehammer and was beating me senseless over the head. Blurry vision, hardly able to stand, and I legitimately, truly thought that the solution was to drink more. So I poured myself a whiskey and threw it back. And I remember feeling this very brief sense of ""Huh, I guess it passed"" before something from my stomach shot up to the top like a volcano and I was basically projectile vomiting all over the kitchen walls, on the counter and in the sink. 

I remember that while my face was buried in the sink now, I found the strength to stand up and collect myself a bit, feeling a bit better and just looking around and seeing the volume of my destruction. ""Wait, *I* did that?"" was immediately what went through my head. But that vomiting wasn't what really made me want to change. It was my daughter having to come out and see it. Yep, she came out of her room and just stood there looking at me and all that vomit. 

And I remember the first thing she said was ""Are you sick, dad?"". And I reassured her that I was okay and that I just had an accident and politely told her to go back to her room for a little while while I cleaned up, and she just nodded and walked away. As soon as she closed her door I immediately burst into tears crying my eyes out on the floor, the stink of my puke really starting to become more apparent. 

I eventually collected myself and scrubbed the whole area down like it was a crime scene. That was the moment I decided to stop. Not my vomiting or me crying, but seeing her standing there just staring in complete confusion and worry. So I also threw out all the bottles and cans that day as well. Anything that wasn't hand sanitizer that contained alcohol was going in the bin. And it stayed there. 

Now it's a year later and, if I'm being honest, I don't feel that different. I mean I'm glad I stopped drinking and that I have my family still with me, but I don't feel any different from a personality perspective. I'm still the same sarcastic and upstanding guy I was before who also loves deadpan humor and can name you 10 of my favorite bands of all time. Nothing's changed, yet everything has at the same time also.",White_Notepad,self.happy,1615648371

happy,My adopted daughter called for me for the first time ever a today and also clung on to me when she got scared after being shy around me since she moved in with us,"So quick summary: Me and my wife of four years wanted to start a family but my she cannot have kids of her own. So after getting in touch with our local adoption agency, and with them living with us for a few months with us as the foster parents, we officially became the parents of two beautiful girls named Amelia (7) and Judy (11). They had been under the care of an actually very sweet and loving older couple who were their foster parents. But obviously with them getting up there in age, it was getting harder for them to take care of the girls. So that's when we stepped in. 

Now when I say she was standoffish, I'm referring to Amelia. She wasn't necessarily scared of me or my wife or anything like that, in fact she was quite comfortable and adjusted very quickly to living with us. She just saw me as a bit intimidating because I'm rather tall (6'5) and have lots of tattoos. I think she thinks I'm like a biker or gangster or something lol. And anytime I'd ask her something like how school was, it was usually just one word answers. But whenever my wife would ask, it'd be hard to get her to stop talking. This happened when we were the foster parents as well. 

So the incident in question happened earlier this afternoon. My wife had taken Judy to the mall to get some more stuff for school since they both may be going back to in-person classroom attendance soon, and I watched Amelia. We had breakfast together and she politely asked if she could go out in the backyard to play. I was doing some work on my laptop in the kitchen and I hear my neighbor's dog (a German Shepherd) barking and don't think much of it. But then a few seconds later I hear her yell Daddy for the first time ever. I jog outside and see her standing there on the verge of tears as my neighbor's dog on the other side of the chain link fence is sitting there looking concerned. 

I go over and kneel down next to her asking ""What's wrong sweetie? Did he scare you?"" and all she does is nod and wrap her arms around me trying not to cry. I smile and tell her ""It's okay sweetie he's not gonna hurt you"" and I pick her up and she's holding on to me with all her strength. I immediately figure out what happened and know the dog isn't a threat because he is the biggest goofball you can imagine: there was a ball next to the fence that Amelia and her sister must have played with and the dog saw her and made the connection in his head that she wanted to play catch and was trying to get her attention to play. I know this because he's done the same thing when I cut the grass or do yardwork and just wants someone to play with. He's honestly the cutest thing

She calms down enough and, while she's still holding on to me, I get the dog to stand up and hold my hand out for him to sniff and lick my hand and say ""See? He's not mean at all"" and I pet him all over his head and he melts in happiness. I then ask her if she wants to try and she doesn't say anything except slowly reaches her hand forward and lets him smell her and she laughs as he licks her hand and she giggles, and I kiss her on the cheek for good cuteness' sake. I even let her throw the ball and he quickly brings it back and dumps it in her hand and she's laughably grossed out and completely forgets why she was scared in the first place. 

Eventually we both head back inside and I make her lunch and it's like an immediate transformation of how she is with me. I just talk about the work I was doing and she's asking me loads of questions like she does my wife and it really just feels awesome. Just wanted to share this story and hope it made some of you smile.",FocusedMaintenance,self.happy,1615592774

happy,I’m really proud of myself for how far I’ve come and I’m looking forward to what I will accomplish.,"I didn’t have a dad growing up, I had a single mother with cerebral palsy who had to raise two boys. I am the oldest. Before my brother and I were born, she was in a horrible car accident where they didn’t think she’d live. Then they didn’t think she’d walk again, but she made it. She lived and eventually married and had us. 

I am forever in her debt for what she did for us. She raised us and never let her central palsy get in the way. You can’t really tell she has it physically, she just had a weak left hand(which is also slightly smaller than a normal had but I never noticed it) and a limp, mentally I think she has most of her brain, but remarkably, what she was missing the rest of the brain made up for. I didn’t find out she had cerebral palsy until I was 27. I thought all of her issues were from her car accident. 
It wasn’t until one day everything kind of fell into place and it made sense. My wife’s sister has cerebral palsy, so I’ve noticed a few things she does that my mom also did. One day I was sitting on the couch with my mom, holding her hand and I suddenly realized my moms hand was significantly smaller than mine.. and it hit me. She had it too. 

She raised two kids, on disability, alone, with cerebral palsy. The world is cruel. Her family helped but they did the bare minimum, we always thought they were doing the most but as we grew we realized we were just a burden. 

Mom never made us feel like that though, she always made us feel loved. She always took care of us. She’s so incredible. I love her so much, I’m going to give her the world. 

My goal is to give people who never had a chance at things they wanted to do, the chance to do just that. Mom and Emma have both had such hard lives. Being neglected by others, being let down, bullied, the feeling of unloved. I’m going to show them that the world isn’t cruel and that they can have whatever they want. 

My accomplishments by age 27:

At 16: won second place at wrestling tournament 

18: graduated hs, accepted into university 
- dropped uni, went to adult Hs to get math credits-

20: graduated adult Hs, accepted into college
22: graduated college

23: started working in govt job with great salary, benefits and pension, started a YouTube channel and getting super fit
24: crushed every PR I have set, YouTube channel starts doing really well
25: hit 200k on YouTube, considering doing it full time along with govt job 
26: bought a condo with fiancée, started cool series with YouTube channel that is doing well. Considering writing a book out of it? 
27: got married, bought house, won youtuber of the year award, 100k on IG, 40k on Twitter, thousands of loyal fans, videos consistently hitting 20,000 views, made this job a great side job
Expanding YouTube channel with merch and products

My primary goal is to take care of my mom, secondary is to build some sort of animal sanctuary if possible, third is def something for orphans or the homeless. 

Idk where I’m going with all this. I’m just really happy and proud of myself.

happy,Found my online friend after half a year of no communication with one another!!,"I don't know if this belongs here, but I but I'm so happy to find my friend I lost a couple months back in late August/Early September. 

So today I was scrolling through the friendship subreddit on u/NeedaFriend when I came along a post of a teenager wanting to befriend others. I was hooked into chatting with this one dude, but as everyone does before sending a message to the person they're willing to talk to, I first had to check the person's post history and the comment history to get a little more info on who this person is, so as I was scrolling through his comment history, I found this one post that sounded so familiar. It said ""[Name of friend] 17M"" and it was months back. So I checked this one person's post history and they had a ton of posts about one specific topic they always talked about with me, which was football and video games. 

After looking endlessly for this one friend through reddit by his username I somewhat remembered, and trying every discord name related to his old tag, I finally thought I found hope when coming across this profile. It was new too. I quickly messaged this person and asked him if his name was what he was called, and he said yes. I continued to tell him that I thought I knew him, questioning him until I told him about who I was and if he remembered and he did, telling me it was actually him. This made me super happy after losing contact with him, I knew him since June of last year, and he was a great friend, and now we're talking with one another on discord again, and I'm just so happy to finally hear from him again! Especially having the weights on my shoulders to finally be settled, where I could explain to him why I disappeared out of the the blue and that he shouldn't worry about anything. 

The most unexpected things comes when you least know it, so if there is something that you don't believe is going to work, or you finally lost all hope, it's all going to be alright in the end. Don't give up! Thanks fo reading, I also wish you a great day or evening!",shy_arcaneguy74,self.happy,1615522730

happy,"I came up with a way to be happy, made an app from my experience!","So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

happy,I just remembered this and it made me happy that I choose the right thing :),"This was a couple months ago and I just remembered it and wanted to share my experience. I was on the train with my friend going to my orchestra and we were about to get off in a couple of stops. I was freaking out about school applications which were coming out in a couple of minutes and were a really big deal because the schools had one or two spots for the grade that I am entering next year. All of a sudden there is this screaming coming from the little space in between the two subway car doors (for people who don't live in NYC there are two subway cars with a little platform connecting them on the outside of the train with almost no protection that are keeping people from falling off or preventing any accidents or deaths.) I look over and see a homeless man screaming ""I am going to jump off I want to die"" repeatedly over and over again. My friend and everybody else in our train car is just ignoring this and acting like nothing is happening because they are used to ""crazy"" people at this point. I'm looking at my friend and say to her that we should get him into the train car and to safety because he is lifting his leg over the side about to jump. My friend turns to me and says stop making a big deal about this its not your business so just stop. At this point the man is halfway over the rope and is about to jump over the side of the train and commit suicide, so I decided then and there that I couldn't let this man die because it is another human beings life on the line and If the adults in the train are too dumb and pretentious to doing anything I might as well. I started talking to the man and trying to coax him into coming back into the train where it is safe and after a couple of minutes of talking to him and telling him that he was deserving of a good and long life he finally came into the train car and was safe. I was approaching my stop and had to get off the train at that point but I made sure to let the conductor know that he was trying to jump and that he should keep looking to make sure the man was safe and out of harm's way. It was a really scary experience but I am really glad that I made the decision to not ignore him and to maybe make a small difference in someone's life. Anyways that's my story and I hope that if you are ever in the same situation you will make the right decision as well.

happy,After so many years of chasing my dream I’ve finally realised it,"As of today I’ve finally achieved a goal of mine that has been with me since I was 9 years old. I’ve finally recorded and fully released my first piece of music with my band, 

I’m currently unable to sleep, my body is just filled with excitement and I needed a place to express the level of joy that is currently rushing through my body. 

Since I was extremely young I’ve always known that I wanted to make something of music in my life and I’ve been taking opportunities as they’ve come up, started with the violin and moved to piano then to guitar and finally because of Guitar Hero of all things, I finally encountered drums and I instantly fell in love, after going through school playing drums in concert bands and other formed and disbanded bands outside of schools, I’ve met a group of people who I get along with so well and am playing a genre of music that I adore and love. After 2-ish years of being with this band I’ve finally realised my dream of being in a band that has released music, with a whole album coming I’m just absolutely over the moon and literally shaking as I write this. 

I apologise for the wording, my mind is currently racing and thinking of how to word things is a challenge, and to everyone out there who is chasing a dream, it can happen!!",Seraphim_Angel,self.happy,1587742430

I will not do anything else for the entire day (including no laptop time!) and I think it will be my most inspirational moment to myself I will ever have.

happy,Got accepted into a Tertiary Preparation Program so I can start the process of going to University,"I didn't know where to post this but I just wanted to share this.

So I (28m) just got accepted into doing a tertiary preparation program (TPP) and I'm pretty excited to start a new chapter in my life.

A bit of a back story on myself, I quit highschool when I was in year 10 and decided to start working full-time as I thought school wasn't for me. I did 3 years of an apprenticeship but never finished it and then when I was 18 I moved out of home and started working on drilling rigs (absolutely love working on the rigs been working on them for 10 years, but I don't want to end up being 60 years old, burnt out and nihilistic like some of the company men I've worked with).

In that time I got married and then fell victim to the oilfield when it comes to relationships and ended up getting divorced at 26, then just kind of floated in the patch working and living my life with no real direction. Spending my hard earned money on frivolous things, getting drunk, doing drugs, partying etc. Then covid happened, I lost my job and have kind of just been floating again no real direction.

Until last week I got a phone call from my mum (love her) and she said she has been thinking a lot about me and thinks I should go to uni and gain some more direction in life and put my ""brain"" to good use. I've spoken with her before about it but was always hesitant due to finances after loosing my job. She then went out and did all the research she could and found out that there is this (TPP) that is absolutely free and with the right grades can get automatic acceptance into the course of my choice through said uni (Australia has its perks I guess). Anyway I did a bit of research after her initial information hunt and applied for the TPP.

I checked my emails today and discovered that they accepted my application and am now enrolled into the program. Although this is way out of my comfort zone I'm actually really excited and happy that not only can I move toward making one of my dreams come true but also happy that my mother gave me this push and believes in me so much.

Tl:Dr Got accepted to start a Tertiary Preparation Program so I can eventually go to University, have a mother that believes in me and am looking forward to starting a new chapter in my life.",itsaculturalthing,self.happy,1593065397

We talked for ages and there was this point where we were standing outside my house, our parents were talking. I hadn't felt like this in a long time. The evening sun was shining on his skin, he was smiling and I was just so drawn to him. He was so attractive, but sort of in multiple dimensions. I just wanted to be with him. It felt like time had stopped and at that moment I felt something. It was this spark that was missing for the past 3 months. The one you don't experience on a video call.

I have tried every way that these ""x ways to make money online"" sites say, but my English level is not that good, so I am currently trying to improve it, but it's still a huge burden and also I haven't studied a specialty that allows me to work only through internet. Anyway, I recently discovered the [r/slavelabour](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/). It has all sorts of tasks for low prices no matter how weird they are. So, I have many international friends and I like studying cultures and history as a hobby, also we like mocking each other's nation and culture all the time. So the idea came and I posted ""I will make jokes about every nation you ask me, 1$ per joke"". So a guy asked me for five. Before I reply to him, I checked his profile and he was Texan, so I started reading Texan history and stereotypes for an hour, and I came out with 5 jokes about US, 3 of them included Texas. But he eventually wanted Mexico. Due to the fact that I used to study Spanish, it wasn't that hard. I also checked some history of Mexico and I quickly came out with 5(I kind of cheated though, because I made one about Colombian stereotypes, but that's a secret). He liked them so much that he also gave me 5 dollars tip. I know that it's not much, but it was a really important small step forward. I have been in plenty of jobs, but I have never been so happy for earning so little money. It was a small sparkle of light in the darkness of my desperation.

happy,The last year has been so difficult for me but from today I choose a return to happiness!,"I've just got out of a year long relationship that really shouldn't have gone past the first 3 months. I love him dearly but I had to work so hard at it. I was never enough, when I dissect it he never really loved me, he needed a distraction and from the beginning he had one foot out the door. He was also going through some difficult things and having me around made his life easier and more difficult at the same time. My relationship with my son has been so incredibly downright ugly for the same period of time. It is completely broken and very difficult which puts huge strain on all aspects of my life. A strain and pressure that I was never able to share. In the last year, between trying to hang on to a love which came along at the wrong time and my son who I was losing everyday, I had become so bitter. So full of hate and anger but most of all I had lost all hope. Today I had such an eye opening conversation with someone that it all clicked. It was my birthday recently and I received so many wishes from people reminding me that I was the funnest, most spontaneous, caring person they knew. How they've loved talking to me and how I have always been able to help them out in their darkest days. I had forgotten how to be me this past year. I had let the panic of trying to hang on to my relationship with my SO and my son completely take over me. Now. I'm not professing to be cured. I will still undoubtedly cry for my lost love, wishing things were different and panic and obsess over my son BUT... I choose to do it with more me, less bitterness and hate and try my best to choose happiness!",5uzie,self.happy,1592831641

happy,BIG surprise and I can't stop smiling and occasionally screaming and dancing with happiness! My student loan is paid in full and this is SUCH a big deal way beyond the money.,"This happened yesterday, I am still struggling to deal with it but in a very good way......I think. I needed to share and it's not something for my RL networks.

I checked my monthly pay that went into my bank account yesterday. It was noticeably higher than normal, which is odd because I'm on a fixed salary, get no overtime or allowances, and any pay increases only happen in August. I went online to check my pay slip and there it was - no student loan deduction made. I only get a SL statement once a year and it's been a while since the last, but at that point I'd calculated my repayments would finish at the end of this year. So this was right out of the blue. I checked with payroll department and yes, they have received notice on 1st of the month to stop taking payments.

Well this is amazing news for anyone of course, and the extra money is going to be FANTASTIC - or will be when lockdown ends and I can get out and use it (not that I'm ungrateful for being safe and still able to work).

But for me this is so much more.

I have had a very difficult relationship with all things relating to my university experience. Right from when I applied - I'd wanted to take a year out before going, parents wouldn't let me, I then wasnt accepted for any of my applications (and this was on the back of me being top of every class at school with tons of extra curricular and volunteer work and everything else you could possibly want). I ended up having to take a year off so I could reapply, but it was too late to be able to do my original plans so I just got a job and watched all my friends leave town. Plus I had to endure my dad not speaking to me for 6 months solid (while I was still living with my parents). Huge mess.

Second time round I got into a world-renowned university.....but halfway through my studies I had a complete mental breakdown...nvm why. PTSD, suicide attempts, very bad stuff. Eventually I dropped out because of it. My parents' reaction to this was so severe that I couldn't possibly move home, had to cut off contact for a while in fact because of the toll it was taking on me dealing with their destructive and controlling and demeaning behaviour. 

This was also just as the credit crunch happened and there I was with no degree, no confidence or support, a suddenly very restricted and competitive job market, trying desperately to keep a roof over my head because to go home would have literally killed me. I racked up credit card debt just to pay the basic bills, I had no social life and lost all my friends, I had to live in a hostel for a while and in many squalid and dodgy places after that too. Trying to explain dropping out of a very prestigious university to potential employers was impossible. As was trying to deal with my mental health and financial problems. Had to take the first job I could get and spent the next 10 years or so trapped in an awful attempt at a career I hated and that made me die inside every day.

I honestly don't know how I got through it.

And all the while the interest was piling up on this 5-figure sum of SL debt.....for which I had absolutely nothing to show. Every year I'd get a statement showing that the interest accrued was more than what I'd repaid, so the debt kept growing and I honestly thought I would never be free of it until I die.

I was so trapped by all of this for such a long time. Doing soul-destroying work because I had no other choice, for nightmare bosses. Living in squalor. Trying to deal with debt and mental health problems. Having no support network. So many times I came close to ending it.

Oh and another real kicker was when I eventually decided to go back to finish my degree to try and break out of this cycle, but because of the funding rules I could not get a further student loan to do so, and would have to pay £9k per year tuition fees UPFRONT from my own pocket, plus living expenses. Not possible.

Dark days. Dark years in fact. But bit by bit it eventually got better.

Through very frugal living I managed to balance my budget. It meant no social life for years and that has done lasting damage to the relationships of my youth, destroyed most of them in fact. But I paid down my credit cards and eventually started to save.

What took longer was building up my confidence and finding better work. I still don't exactly love what I do but there is at least meaning to it, and variety and challenge. And that's good enough. Plus through hard work and a fair dose of good luck I have managed to become moderately successful. I lead a team, although I still so often feel like an imposter. I'm surrounded by people not just with degrees but extensive postgrad study, doctorates, etc. I even manage some of them. To be in my position without a degree is very unusual. But however difficult and 'not me' the work may sometimes be it is at least work I can take pride in.

It's perhaps ironic that I now work at a university. And even now there are days when that is in itself very hard because I see so much of where my life could maybe have gone instead.

So for all these years - about 14 of them - I've had this SL debt hanging over me, reminding me what a waste it was, always pulling me back to all the things I went through because of that failed attempt at study.

And now - BAM! With one glance at my monthly pay, it's all gone. The debt is gone. The last tangible link to all that horrible history is gone. The fact that it was a surprise has made the impact even deeper.

I'm suddenly free of so much more than the financial debt. And I can't stop going nuts over it.

Bottle of bubbly has been popped 🍾

My parner is at home, making burgers for dinner, and a mudcake for dessert. 

Last night my girlfriend slept over, for the first time ever. We haven't seen eachother for a *very* long time.

Tomorrow, we'll make tortillas. Me, my partner, my second girlfriend and the kids all together. Then my partner will leave, and me and this other girlfriend are going to have the next two days to ourselves.

On top of all this, I'm full of new relationship energy. Recently a new person was hired to my work place. There was instant chemistry between us. Last week we went biking together, and ended up making out for an hour. I had decided not to date anyone else, but I just couldn't resist her. She such a lovely woman. I really hope everything goes well and she'll become my third girlfriend. The next day she came over to our place, and the sex was amazing. She's the kind of energetic extrovert everyone notices.

happy,I am a single parent . Today my son asked me to leave my job.,"I am from India. I had undergone 9 years of domestic violence. One day I was beaten black and blue that it showed all over my body and I could not move an inch, I walked away with my 7 year old kid. My ex was highly educated. But he was a big time narc.

I had no support financially. My mother alone looked after my child when I did multiple jobs ( teaching various subjects at college level) . I have endured a lot of hardships. Most were financial. The rest were the harsh words of people, especially those who were not even close to me. Some laughed at my plight. Many accused me of unpalatable things. I was stupid back then. I let it all affect me. I went into depression. Yet I never stopped learning new things.

I can proudly say that my son is what he is today because of my own efforts.

My kid is 24 now . He is earning a lot. He is afraid that if I have to go out I might catch infection So he said that I rather stop working.

He showers love on me and pampers me to bits. I reminded of my dead dad and grandpa. I miss them so much . I never thought that after them someone else can shower love on me this way .

My son makes me laugh . He is awesome company.

Suddenly after he saying so , I seem to have lost most of my fears. I feel, now I can give 0 fucks very easily.

I don't want her to know I'm typing this happy rant frantically (she's about to come in from the other room).

I really just don't know who to celebrate this happy news with. I told one of my guy friends, and as much as I love him, he was a typical dude and didn't have a lot to say. I just feel like I need to yell to the heavens how happy I am.

If one person reads this and smiles 1% I'll feel like my need to share this news, that's defining a significant part of my life, is sane!

I said « no » to too many opportunities because I knew that there was a possibility of it being awkward. Like if people I don’t usually hang out with asked me if I wanted to hang out with them I’d come up with a lame excuse. For years. Sounds stupid right?
Well I finally decided that I’m no longer going to let that part of me control my life. I’m going to be more open and say yes to every opportunity I get, even if I think that it might be uncomfortable. Because I’ve probably missed so many great moments because of that. Anyway I didn’t know where to post it but I had to because I feel amazing as if I’d just woken up from a bad dream. I’m finally starting to feel brave and genuinely happy because of that decision.

My dad tried to convince me that $20 was fine but nope. So we get there, my dad gives him food, he made my sister give him some banana bread. After that my dad was like ""he has something for you too."" So I gave him the money, smiling, and he was like ""Awww thanks! Are you sure?"" I was like hell yeah dude it's all yours. He hugged me and it was very sweet and I could tell I made him happy. His phone got stolen so the $40, plus $10 from my dad was going to that. Now I have $80 and honestly that's perfectly fine. I got a haircut, hoodies, basically everything else I wanted so I didn't need the money, but if I gave it all away my family would probably be like ""that was kinda stupid.""

happy,"Bills paid, food in fridge, happiest Christmas","So my boyfriend grew up incredibly poor; the kinda poor you stay where there’s food with all your cousins and don’t think anything of it, where you get one drink and five straws... his childhood consisted of ghettos, people in and out of his life, and he only found solace in football. Unfortunately a football injury left him partially paralyzed and his dreams of escaping and providing for his family through a scholarship which paid for his education were crushed. Twelve years later he’s finally stable and going back to school. 

We don’t have a super surplus of money but we live comfortably- two cars, bills paid, Internet, cable, food in fridge. He reminds me daily how great it is to come home and be able to watch a game.. This Christmas season I wasn’t able to get him everything he deserves, mainly because we had to scrimp together money for his laptop for school... plus our one PlayStation 4 crapped out on us just before the holidays but he couldn’t be happier given that we aren’t worried about tomorrow. I feel so humbled and blessed that he is able to finally relax and work on school, not worrying about if he’s going to have food or a bed. 

I cannot wait to afford more luxuries for this great and humble man. But right now, I’m just so happy, seeing someone be able to finally relax although he busts his ass working three jobs and attending school full time. ",terribleTara23,self.happy,1545759331

happy,I am so proud of myself. 2018 is the year I kicked mental illness in the ass.,"Hello everybody, and Merry Christmas!

I am 19 years old. I have been suicidal since I was 8. I started self harming when I was 11, and kept doing so until not too long ago. It got really bad. I developed an eating disorder and you know sometimes it *still* kicks my ass. 

2018 was pretty terrible for me. Had two not-so-great boyfriends, flunked out of college (again), got diagnosed with BPD and a plethora of other things, and got to a point where I couldn’t even get out of bed in the morning. 

In November, I finally found the will in myself to *want* to get better. I was sick of hating myself and wanting to die every single day. I got back into therapy. I started medication for the first time. I figured out once and for all that I’m non-binary, and I have amazing friends who’ve taken it in stride and use they/them for me and call me by a new name. 

Let me tell you, folks. I have never felt so happy and at peace with myself *ever*. I feel like I am finally, truly, happy.

Medication and therapy has worked like a charm for me. My friends are so amazing and supportive. One of them mentioned that my entire demeanor as a person has changed. 

I have to say this, however: the medication and therapy would not have worked if I had not first gained the will to get better. It literally starts there. I’ve had therapists and medication in the past, and it did jack shit cause I didn’t care if I got better back then. I care now. I care so much now. 

Self love is so important. It has taken me 19 years to learn. I can finally see myself as a person who is learning and growing just the same as everyone else, and I can recognize that some people are further along, and some are farther behind. We’re all just on our own road to victory.

I can finally look into my future and see light. If you had told me one month ago - that’s right, one *month* ago - that I would be so happy and energized and ready for life, I would’ve laughed in your face and said something about wishing to be dead. 

This is the first time in my life I want to be alive. I am so ready for life. This may seem like a silly remark, but I scrolled straight past a “like to instantly die” meme today, because I don’t want to die anymore. I want to live.

To anybody out there who’s struggling with this same shit, I promise you there is hope. There is light at the end of the tunnel. I know you’ve heard it a billion times and said “bah” to the very idea a *billion* times, but take it from someone who was there just a month ago. Things get better. You just need the will to make it happen, and I know that’s the hardest shit in the world. It took me 11 conscious years to find the will. I know you can too. There is hope. 

Thank you so much for reading, I hope you’re having/had a very merry christmas this year!! 

TL;DR: I’m not suicidal for the first time in 11 years!! I still have a ways to go in recovery, but I can finally truly say that I am *HAPPY*!!!!! 

P.S. Sorry for the rambling I am just so excited for life and I had to get it all out!!!! ",Timeristic,self.happy,1545741094

My wife is a rock, and when she's feeling healthy, she loves getting on cancer forums and supporting others. I'll be returning to work next week after caregiving for the last 6 months. 

The fine doctors, nurses, chemists, and volunteers at the BC Cancer Center in Victoria have been so crucial to our journey. Thank you.

I just had to share, Monday I had $20 in my checking account and no idea how I was going to survive until my next disbursement, today I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. ",angerona_81,self.happy,1544664440

happy,"Surprised my girlfriend for X-mas, her reaction makes me tear up with happiness.","To give this a bit of a preface, we have been together for 4 years.  When she was little, she used to go to Disney a lot, but as she got older, there were a lot of family and financial problems.  For her, Disney is truly the happiest place in the world.

We had mentioned that we would go to Disney together as a long-term goal for both of us and as her dream.  However, she works part-time, saving up only a little every now and then.  I am a graduate student, so I don't make much but have been able to save up for nearly 2 years for this.  We always joked that we be able to go in a few years when she has graduated college and I finish my Ph.D.... Little did she know.

I bought the tickets, the plane, and it's not super fancy, but it's something.  Christmas has always been her favorite time of the year, so we set up decorations, just watched a Christmas movie (Polar Express), and were watching some Disney videos (her favorite pasttime).  

I asked her a few questions about a new ride they were opening and she said ""Oh that will be done by the time we go in a few years.""  I asked ""Would it be done by next year?""  Her:  ""Most likely, but for sure in a few.""

So I went to my bag, and told her to read something real quick.  I printed out the confirmation with the dates, the flights, the whole package.  I gave that to her.  At first she asked, ""What is this...?""  Looked at me and then started reading.  She began to well up and asked again.  I looked at her and said we were going to Disney.  She burst into tears ;-; ""Is this a dream?  Am I dreaming?  You're joking right?""

Welp, [THIS](https://youtu.be/K2dfvnpaZcU) is 10 seconds after I presented her with the paper.

So I've been big fan of the Smash Bros. series for a long time and I have been saving a pretty penny over the last couple of months to buy a switch and a copy of Smash Bros. Ultimate to come with it. Yesterday my buddy Q got into a car accident (he's fine and didn't hit anyone). He banged up his car real bad and it needed some heavy repairs. He came to me and asked if i cop spot him for the repairs as he didn't have the money. So I gave him my switch money, about $600. At first he didn't want to take it because he knew I had been wanting this for awhile, but he accepted. I told him no rush on paying me back with the holidays coming up. It felt really good to help him out. No matter how much enjoyment I could have gotten of the game it pales in comparison to helping my bro. He need it more than I did and I can always just save up and buy it later. Thanks for reading this and please do something nice, even if it's something small. Have a good Holiday, Reddit.

happy,"After a difficult year, I want to recognize Mrs. Wanda - a retail store employee who went above and beyond her job duties to show me the true spirit of Christmas. (Story and photo inside.)","My four-year-old-daughter has been begging Santa to bring her one of those ""LOL Surprise"" egg things that apparently is one of the ""it"" toys this Christmas.  I have been out of state for two months and missing my little girl like crazy.  Fortunately, I will be surprising my little one with my return on Christmas morning! ...and bringing her a ""Big LOL Surprise"" thingamajig thanks to the kindness of Mrs. Wanda at Walmart.

I really needed to find one of the toys for *cheap* because I've been unemployed since June.  A few weeks ago I read that a specific one - *a BIG one* \- was on clearance at Walmart for $17, down from something like $80-$100 originally.  Last Sunday I searched six different Walmart stores for it but I had zero luck.  I was bummed out, but would have to settle for a smaller one that had a few surprises in it.

Early last week and just a couple of days after my search I called a local  Walmart and asked to speak with someone in toys. I figured it wouldn't amount to anything but couldn't hurt to ask someone in the toy section; I really wanted to give my daughter the biggest toy I could afford since I  haven't seen her in so long. I have called a Walmart before, and  getting in touch with someone in a specific department is about as easy as calling a radio station to win concert tickets (people might not do that anymore but I'm old.)  To my surprise, *someone actually answered my call*.  I told them I was looking for a toy that was on clearance and that it was a long shot. Then, before I could say anything else, the lady asked  if I had seen it on the Walmart site and asked if I would text her the SKU number and a picture of the item so she could look for it.  I was shocked.  It was impressive she was willing to look around for me during  the busiest time of the year, and it was *especially impressive*  that she was willing to get her personal cell phone involved, being  that I was a random customer. So I texted her a picture of the toy along with the SKU figuring I'd get a call five minutes later saying she  couldn't find it.  An hour passed and she called me back to say she had combed the toy department and the stock room - even asking her manager for help - but could not find it.  I wasn't surprised she didn't see  one, but I was incredibly impressed that she made such an effort to help  me.

*Here's the kicker...*

Last night I while I was browsing Reddit I received a call from a local phone number I didn't recognize and I answered it.

""*Hey, this is Wanda from Walmart.*""

In that moment I was not even thinking about the phone call I had made  early last week.  Mrs. Wanda went on to say she had been in the back of the store looking for an item for a customer (apparently she is awesome to everyone) when she ran across a box that had a mysterious ""LOL Surprise"" toy that looked like the one in the picture I sent.  She took the item  to a register and checked the price, and when it rang up as $17 she looked through her phone to find our text exchange, and called me to see if I still wanted it.  I was REALLY in shock.  I told her I'd be there in 30 minutes if she could hold it for me.

""*I'll be wearing it like a purse.  I'll make sure no one else takes it.*""

I  immediately hopped in my car and drove like a mad man to the crowded Walmart, bolting to the toy section as quickly as I have ever moved through a retail store.  There was a group of people huddled up, thanking someone profusely for their help; and as they departed I saw a Walmart employee standing there... with a ""Big LOL Surprise"" toy hanging from her arm like a purse.

My first words in the moment were, ""*Mrs. Wanda?  I need a hug*"" and I pointed to the toy on her arm.  She flashed me the biggest smile and gave me a hug like we were old friends.  I told her she had no idea what she had just done for me, and that she was making me the Father of the Year.  I asked her if she would take a picture with me, then I started getting emotional - a grown man, holding a ""Big LOL Surprise"", standing next to the bicycles and crying.  She told me to stop crying or she would start, and I quickly got her information so I could tell someone the story of what she did for me. 

 [**Here is the picture of Mrs. Wanda and me with the toy.**](https://imgur.com/a/P3qIigq)

**QUESTION:** Fellow Redditors, what is the BIGGEST way I can show my appreciation for Mrs. Wanda's help?  What she did is not business as usual.  After a ridiculously difficult year, I felt the joy of Christmas for the first time thanks to her help.  I will never forget that interaction and I want her to get the recognition she deserves.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Merry Christmas to all!  Everyone needs a Mrs. Wanda in their life.

**NOTE:** This is not a /r/hailcorprate post.  I didn't say the store name in the post title, but leaving it out of the story would just seem silly.  Also, Mrs. Wanda said I could share this.  So it's cool.",Midiex,self.happy,1544482194

This is MASSIVE to me. Back in freshman year, I worked a couple jobs and spent all the money I made on clothes (financial IQ right here). Over 2 years I must have spent maybe $3000 or more on clothes and shoes. I was dope. I'd get compliments on all my shit.

Then out of nowhere my adult metabolism kicked in and I gained lots of weight. Went from 155ish to 210 at my max. Felt exhausted and depressed doing everything. Also had less money and stopped caring about appearance, so I went from fashionable outfits to hoodies and basketball shorts. 

I've been losing weight (keto started the chain process) and now in my senior year I'm down to 167. My face is more lean. My jeans fit again, they didn't fit at all at the start of the semester. I'd like to hover around 155 and bulk up in muscle, but man I just feel over the moon right now.

Long story short, today is what I consider to be the birthday of the end of my depression !

So it means that today, it's been two years that I am finally happy, literally full of joy ! 

It can sound weird but, in a way, it was a good experience, now I can see what is important in life : family, friends, happiness and love.

I am so grateful to have those people who helped me during my struggle 

I am very lucky, and just wanted to share it with you, it is not a big event but I am literally crying tears of joy, because I made it, trough this very harsh times, I MADE IT.

I kick out my abusive bf of my countryside, and I never feel stronger in my whole life.

I want to thank everyone and everything, the sea, the sunflowers and the blue sky.

happy,The sheer and absolute joy I felt at the announcement of a re-release of one of my favorite childhood games.,"So while most the internet likes to poopoo the FMV games of the 90s, I was unironically a huge fan of them. The Sega CD was one of my favorite consoles as it gave me these nutty games like Sewer Shark. My absolute favorite (to the point where BlockBuster knew what I wanted when I came in) was Corpse Killer.

I cannot explain how much i love this cheesey game. I have my copy autographed by one of the actors in the game (Bill Mosely), and spent hours playing it.

Now there is a company who, starting a year and a half ago, started re-releasing HD ports with special features of old FMV games. It started with Night Trap then Double Switch.

During E3 i waited in anticipation for their next big release. I expected it to be Sewer Shark as it was the Sega CD launch game.

What i got was Corpse Killer. And my excitement knew no bounds. After nearly 20 years, I am finally getting to replay one of my favorite childhood games!!!

happy,I've hit seven months without a single panic attack or case of long-lasting anxiety.,"NOTE: Sorry, this is an extremely long post, but it goes through when I started getting panic attacks and through my recovery. Also, sorry in advance for any typos and my bad grammar... I'm using a g-board and also my English is pretty bad.

Last year, for about half a year or so, I had really bad anxiety.

When it first started, I didn't understand what was happening to me. All I knew was that I felt weird, and it was a bad kind of weird. It frustrated me to not understand what I was feeling, just that I felt strangely off sometimes (and it felt like it was on a health-level) and I didn't like it. I don't know what I realized first: that when this happens, my heart was beating instantly fast, or that the emotion I was feeling felt close to fear...

It went on like that for weeks, maybe even a month... During that month, it got worse and worse and I realized something really wasn't right and I wasn't just overreacting. It became hard to breathe during those episodes, it would usually be promoted by or prompt overthinking, and I felt like I wasn't really in my body. I constantly feel afraid for no reason, and I noticed I started to spend more time frowning than I did smiling... a LOT more time.

Then, it got even worse. I began having these episodes when I showered. At first, it was once every three or so days, then every two days, then every day... I would classify them as episodes at the time, because I just couldn't explain it. And these episodes were way worse in the shower, and I feel like that was because there was no one around to watch it happen. I would start to lose my breath, find it hard to breathe, feel my heart pounding, feel so scared, feel like I wasn't even in my body, I felt so detached, so alone, and I would cry so hard I would almost throw up. All I would feel like doing is sitting down on the shower floor and curling up into a ball. This got so bad, I dreaded showers. Absolutely DREADED.

That continued for months and months. At a certain point, probably two months in, I realized that those ""episodes"" were panic attacks, and I had death anxiety. Being an over-thinker and an atheist, I've never had a way to grasp the idea of what happens after we die, because I believed nothing would happen. I was embarrassed. That's all I felt for a long time, because I thought it was the dumbest thing to have anxiety because of a fear. I hated myself for being that way, and I was so frustrated with myself.

It was probably around 4 months in when a I finally began to talk to someone about it: my online friend I've had for many years. I knew she has had terrible stress and anxiety issues in the past, and I needed answers to my questions about anxiety problems as well as an ear to let it all out. Plus, I'm still a minor, so I live with my parents, and I love and appreciate my parents, but I've never liked being emotional (especially with my family) so I've always dreaded talking about these things with my parents and kept it a secret... I just wasn't ready to tell them. During the shower I took later on that day, I didn't have an episode. It really helped, and over the course of two months, the frequency of my panic attacks slowly faded away.

I still remember the time I cried at school during my recovery. I wasn't sad, I was happy. I was walking back from lunch to my classroom building (we have to walk outside to go between the two buildings about a quarter mile apart) all alone, since I forgot my backpack at lunch, so my teacher let me go grab it. And I remember I was smiling, and I noticed I was smiling and that I felt so content halfway in, and that meant the amount of progress I was going through was astonishing. I hadn't smiled of felt happy in the past few months at that point, and all I've felt was fear or sadness. It made me so happy, I cried all my way back to the building.

I started talking to a camp friend about my anxiety after that, as well. And from there, it was all uphill. That smile gave me so much motivation, it was such a nice reward... Never had I been more grateful to be able to genuinely smile. It took time, and my spring sports season also really helped with my recovery, but I eventually made it. Once, I was crying myself to sleep daily and relying on rescue pastilles to go through the school day, and now I'm crying tears of joy at the thought of my recovery and enjoying every second of my life. It's been seven whole months since my last panic attack, and I couldn't be happier about whether I'm at in life right now.

LONG STORY SHORT, I had anxiety and terrible panic attacks for months and spent months trying to get better. It's been seven months since my full recovery and last panic attack and I'm extremely glad about it. I'm so grateful for where I'm at now, and I couldn't be happier.

FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE SAME OR SIMILAR THINGS, please please please TALK TO SOMEONE about it. If you don't feel comfortable telling your friends yet, you are always welcome to talk to me. Talking was what got me to where I'm at, and believe me when I say that it helps a lot more than you can imagine. I went from feeling at my worst to my best in just a few months because I talked about it, and the two friends I talked about it to, I don't see regularly because one is from summer camp-schools and the other is an online friend. Please also find what works for you. For me, exercise really helped easy my stress and anxiety levels, and it seems to be the case for most people.",poppyfield_76,self.happy,1565500787

happy,"I made breakfast in bed for my girlfriend this morning for her birthday and then surprised her after she finished with an engagement ring I had my brother make for her that says ""I love you"" in her native Icelandic. She said yes!","We met three years ago. I was a cook/food runner at a local bar she and her friends would go to often. We also went to the same university just up the road. I'll never forget on the first date we had how nervous she was not just because it was a date, but because she was still trying to master English. Almost the whole date consisted of ""Huh?"" and ""What?"" from both of our ends lol. But whenever she managed to make a clear sentence, she actually was pretty funny and was 10x smarter than me. We started going steady soon after and graduated together and got our own apartment soon after. There hasn't been a day I wasn't happy to see her. 

As for the ring, my older brother does blacksmithing as a hobby and is a welder by profession. When I originally came to him about the ring, he was hesitant because he had never actually made a ring before. But we worked something out and a few weeks later, he presented me with a beautiful silver colored titanium engagement ring that actually left me stunned at how pretty it was. On the inside of it, I had him write ""I love you"" in her Icelandic language. 

This morning, I got up early and made her favorite breakfast: Chocolate chip pancakes with bananas and skyr (which is basically yogurt and cheese mixed together). I was so ancy because I just wanted to give her the ring and know her answer lol. I tell her to close her eyes and I put it in her hands and she almost screams in shock. Then, through her tears of joy, she just nods her head and I breathe the biggest sigh of relief before sliding that puppy right on her finger. It fit perfectly. I think she cried even more when she saw the ""I love you"" on the inside. But wait there's more! 

I took out my guitar and played [1, 2, 3, 4](https://youtu.be/m6pW_q1PvH0) by the Plain White T's for her. I first learned of this song when we visited my other brother in Chicago and they just happened to be playing a small concert nearby. And when I heard that song, I just kept it in the back of my head. I won't get into how much my singing voice sucks but I think she tolerated it for a little bit lol. 

So anyway, I'd say it's been an eventful day. I also booked us dinner at a fancy restaurant in town (she hates but doesn't hate when I go all out for her). I hope your day was as good as mine! :)",IntriguedParsley,self.happy,1565481847

The game carried on and eventually ended 9-1 to us in our biggest win of the season.

The title explains it all! We had been trying to have kids since so long and we have finally succeeded! We both are so happy right now. This is also my 8th month and it's been great honestly. My husband has always been so caring and even more so after getting pregnant.

A few years into our marriage so many people adviced my husband as ""well wishers"" to either leave me or remarry because of my inability to have kids but he instead stood up for myself and never stopped loving me any less.

I'm just so so happy right now and I really wanted to share it with someone. I'm a highly introverted person and don't have too many friends (i'm an orphan so my husband and now our child ❤ are the only family I have).

So for anybody trying for a child or anything else for that matter dont stop trying! You will fail but it's important you rise back up again and surround yourself with people who will encourage you instead of discouraging you :) keep trying.

If I cross a 2-drink threshold I can't stop - I will drink all the alcohol in my house/surroundings until it's all gone or I'm unconscious. If I'm at a bar I'll drink until it closes. It's ugly. My wife drinks too but not as much as me and she knows when to stop. Virtually every time I get that drunk I either become a sobbing mess or get callous and distant towards her. It's affecting my marriage and affecting my professional life. My office manager pulled me into the hallway a few weeks ago and told me to go home and shower/change because I reeked of alcohol from a binge the night before.

I finally found a therapist near my work who specializes in substance abuse and alcoholism. He and I discussed my issues, I gave him some examples of some really bad times I'd had and how much it was affecting my life. He told me that we're going to have two or three more sessions and come up with some strategies on what to do when I'm feeling like I need that 3rd, 4th, 5th beer. 

I doubt this post will get up there but I just wanted to share that I'm thrilled to finally have a professional step in and help me get my life in order.

I’m fortunate enough to have parents who graciously let me live with them rent-free to focus on getting my mental health in order and finding the right job for me.

It’s been hard going from living on my own for a year and a half to living with my parents, so getting this apartment (I just got the call an hour ago) is a huge step in the right direction. I can’t wait to be independent again.

My new job has better, more consistent hours and is in a much more laid back environment. They’ll provide me with a ton of training and guidance and it’s a giant stepping stone into the corporate side of the industry I’ve been working for the past three years, which is what I’ve wanted to do from the beginning. This company was the number one I wanted to work for, too! 

I’ve also started taking commissions for my embroidery which makes me so happy and proud as I’ve never been a very artistic person so it means so much that my friends like my work enough to pay me for it.

Oh, and I’m gonna get a cat! I’ve always had family pets, but never one of my own. I absolutely cannot wait!

1- I won a baking contest! I submitted a recipe that is a very humble food, and it is something I make alot of.... and it won! 

2- A meeting with my son's principal was very positive. I was geared up to defend a compromise between my son and his teacher. The the principle was on my side from the start of the meeting. We spent the meeting talking about how things would develop and change for the better. I was so relieved and walked away from the meeting feeling very positive for my son.

3- My 13 yr wedding anniversary. My husband and I went to a fine dining restaurant for the first time in many years. We sat and ate and just slowed down to enjoy each others company,  the music being played, and all around ambiance. We sat with out a care in the world and it was fantastic. 

4- Went to a family night hockey game (that we had planned well in advance). We had a all around good night even though the home team didn't win. The kids had a great time at their first hockey game, and we plan to do it again. 

5- Got to see friends and hang out with some family. With everyone so rushed and having many commitments, it was really nice to just be able to hang out today.

6- Planned a meet up with a family member that I have been searching for for many years. This last one is a big deal because it's been years and years in the making. I dont know if I'll be able to sleep because I am so excited! 

This week has pulled me through an emotional rollercoaster of thrills. Seriously dumbfounded at the positive that keeps on shining through out the week.

Anyways, I feel the need to share a testimony because it's not good to dwell on sadness all the time, right? Well, during my senior year finals I was super depressed and all I did was bing eat and watch Netflix all day. My depression literally crippled me and stopped me from studying the way I should have. 

But, I got my results back a few days ago and I got AMAZING grades. So amazing that I was featured in a few local newspapers! I honestly thank God because the one thing I always did before writing an exam was pray that he would be with me and help me during the exam. I know not everyone on this forum believes in God, but he really helped me during a dark time in my life. When I say that I absolutely did not try during finals, I mean it. So to get the grades that I did was definitely an act of divine intervention by God. I don't know what I would have done if I actually got the results that reflected the effort I put into studying LOL. 

Anyways, I just wanted to share this because it's something that made me really, really, really happy and GRATEFUL. To God be the glory for real. It really started off my 2019 in a positive note and I hope that it stays that way. 

Also, I'm really, really happy and grateful that I found this subreddit too!

I was told taking six classes was very stupid, considering the workload. Keep in mind, I know people take six classes all the time in college, but again this is law school. I was also told I was stupid for taking the hardest course at my school while taking five our courses. 

Grades are in and I killed it this semester. I got an A- in “the hardest course at our school,” which I thought I completely failed. The rest were all A’s or A-‘s and one B. I can’t brag to my friends at school, so here it is Reddit. That is all. ",QuidProQuo22,self.happy,1547061948

happy,My mom makes me very happy because she's such a wonderful person,"First of all, I would like to say hello to everybody on this wonderful subreddit! Second of all, please forgive me if I do anything wrong by accident; trust me, I read the rules.

Now, let me get to the real nitty-gritty: women make me feel happy, but none more so than my very own mother. Why? Well, she's been very understanding in regards to my various quirks and has done whatever it takes to make sure I can live a happy, fulfilling life of my own in case something were to happen to her. She has also been kind enough to allow me and my brothers to visit my father (himself an awesome person, but that's a different story) on the weekends even after they divorced. Also, she has always been there for me - in spirit, if not always physically - when I needed a helping hand and I felt as though no one else would help. 

My mom's a very strong woman as well, having experienced numerous challenges herself and choosing not to give up on life. Not only that, but she isn't afraid to speak up or take action when she feels that something is wrong. I mean, good luck to you if you get on her bad side. That aside, she's instilled me with a strong sense of justice and respect for those who are of different ethnicities, genders, orientations and other immutable background traits. I may not agree with all of her political opinions, but she has also instilled me with the ability to understand where people are coming from even if I hate them or their opinions. 

Politics aside, what I really love is all of the happy memories we've shared over the years, such as the time she saved up money and went on a school-sponsored trip to France and Italy with me when none of the other people in my French class elected to go. Another thing she really did that impacted me was the time she told me that I was a better human being than she was. I'll admit, I've committed my share of mistakes, but to hear that sort of thing from somebody who is herself a wonderful human being in spite of all the things she did that I didn't like (which I'm not going to call her out on here) really means A LOT to me.

So mom, if you're reading this, I just wanna let you know that I love you very much and that you're forgiven for any wrongs that you may have committed towards me! ",NewEnglandSynthOrch,self.happy,1547049095

happy,Listening to my dog bark in his sleep warms my heart to no end.,"Here I am, 4am, haven’t slept and probably won’t sleep tonight. Stressed to all hell. Dealing with a chronic health issue that frustrates me more often than not. But I have my puppy.

He’s not really a puppy anymore: his fifth birthday is in May. But he’s my puppy. He’s been my A1 since day one. He helped me survive a stupidly abusive relationship, and endured some abuse himself, but he’s never lost his puppy smile and happy demeanor. 

He’s admittedly not the brightest bulb, but guys, he tries *so* fucking hard to learn or do whatever I ask of him. If I’m trying to teach him a trick that he just can’t grasp, he will practice until he’s blue in the face, and then he’ll excuse himself to go pout on his bed because he just doesn’t get it, and knows he doesn’t understand, but then he will pick up the next day like nothing ever happened and will give it his all again and again. 

This little man has kept my head above water when I felt like all I could do was give up and drown. He knows when I’m upset, and he curls himself up under my arm or around my neck like a cat and doesn’t let go. I can’t tell you how many times he’s licked away my tears and brought me his favorite toy to try and cheer me up. 

He has never met a stranger, human or animal, and he wants the whole world to be as happy as he is. Training him has taught me immeasurable patience. He’s shown me how to take stock of the little moments and just stop and feel the breeze on my face and the sun on my skin. He is so patient and so forgiving. Is it possible to look up to your dog a little? 

Right now he’s curled up in the small of my back, barking tiny baby barks at something in his dream, and kicking me in the back. I still wouldn’t trade him for anything. He’s my first baby, and he always will be. I just love him. ",abellaviola,self.happy,1547028586

happy,I'm dating the love of my life!,"I have anger issues. I bottle my feelings up inside and then when something finally sets me off I explode. I believe these issues started when I was a kid. My dad was in prison from the time I was six years old all the way up until I was 13. My mom was embarrassed by this and told me not to tell any of the other kids. If anyone were to ask where my dad was I was supposed to say he was on a business trip. My mom used to cry all the time when my dad was in prison, so I saw it as my responsibility to be ""strong"". So, despite my sadness, I didn't cry once during the 7 years my dad was in prison. I believe this is where I learned to ""bottle"". I don't blame my mom, nor do I view this story as an excuse for my anger issues. Anyways... let's get to the happy part.

2 years ago I met the love of my life. She's beautiful, kind and as compassionate as could be. But most importantly, I trust her completely. Surprisingly enough, we met through Tinder. Our first date was to a comedy show. On the drive back to her house, she asked about my childhood. At this point, I don't think either of us thought the date was going particularly well and I didn't expect to see her again, so I told her everything... stuff I still haven't told some of my oldest friends. She listened to me and even shared some stuff about herself. Neither of us had the greatest childhoods growing up, but after talking to her and listening to what she had to say I knew she was someone I wanted to be friends with. Which is why I was very sad when I found out she was going to a school 2 hours away from me. I had finally found someone I could trust, but they were moving away...

She invited me to her going away party. After a few minutes there I realized I was the odd one out. Everyone else there she had known for years. Family, old childhood friends and me. But not once did I feel out of place. We had a fun night of playing board games and talking. When I left I hugged her and she said: ""I have something for you!"" and ran to her room and came back with a CD she had burned for me. For the next couple of months that CD was all that I listened to.

Even though we had just met a couple weeks before she went away to school, I visited her every weekend. The more time I spent with her the more I grew to like her and eventually I fell in love with her. Since our first ""date"" didn't really end up romantically, I asked her if she'd be interested in going on a second first date and she said yes. I was so happy!

And this happiness continues to this day! It feels so nice to have someone in my life that I can trust and help me to work through my anger issues. I'm happy to say I'm a much less angry person than I was 2 years ago. Thanks to my GF's understanding and constructive criticism, I feel much more in control of my emotions and I feel like I'm able to articulate how I'm feeling to her in a clear and calm manner.

happy,I feel included for the first time in a long time,"Hey all, first time poster, this is such a strange strain of happiness and I wanted to share. 


Generally when I meet people in a place where they’re forced to spend time with me (i.e. grade school, summer camp, college classes, etc), they generally seem to enjoy my company. I like to think I’m a kind person, though I will admit I can be a little overwhelming with how much I try and take care of people and make sure everyone is happy and healthy. I’m generally seen as the “mom” of friend groups. So these people like me- until we hang out on our own, outside of this forced interaction. As soon as we go out on our own, they apparently decide that they’ve made a mistake and I never hear back from them again. It’s been that way my entire life, so I’m used to it, albeit extremely disheartened. Because of this and other health issues, I’ve been completely isolating myself over the past year. However, an acquaintance from high school reached out last weekend and asked if I wanted to hang out. I agreed, and had a wonderful time meeting some new people as well as the softest gray cat ever, a super fluff tuxedo kitty, and a lovely but  deaf-as-shit Australian cattle dog. I left after a few rounds of Mario Party and prepared myself for regulation disappointment. But. BUT. They reached out to me again today, and invited me to watch Hereditary with them and their friends! They’re all getting together to watch a movie and they thought of ME! I actually might cry 


I just want people to know that if you feel like you’re alone and that there’s no one out there for you to lean on or talk to, that’s not the case. There’s always people that care.

happy,I met someone who shares a similar background and is looking for a lot of the same things I'm looking for!,"I'm not idealizing this person - everyone comes with baggage.  But after 3 years of failing to find someone who is interested in a specific type of relationship - meaningful but not long term - I'm so happy that I met her.  


Without going too deep into it she's married and her wife and her are in an open relationship which is exactly what I'm looking for right now - the chance to connect with someone on a physical and emotional level without the pressure of longterm monogamy.  I spent the first 22 years of my adult life being the dutiful husband and father and now that I'm free of a loveless marriage and my children are adults I'm looking for a very hard to find type of situation.  I'm bisexual and most of the men I want just want a physical relationship and most of the women I meet just want a baby daddy/future husband.  


I'm not naive, I know what I want is laden with minefields but I think this is the right relationship for now and I couldn't be happier.

Even if it goes nowhere beyond our plan to meet for coffee and chat I couldn't be more thankful because just getting to talk to her and explore our shared interests and backgrounds has been incredibly rewarding.  My eyes are open, I'm not thinking everything will be easy - a lot of the time open relationships seem to be code for drama and dysfunction - but I'm allowing myself to still enjoy the thrill of crushing on someone because I haven't felt this in decades.",Smile_lifeisgood,self.happy,1566629270

happy,Yesterday was my 1 year clean from dope anniversary - celebrated with my new husband by jet skiing and snorkeling on the reefs in Mexico,"So I made a post on here a little under a year ago when I had reached my 2 week mark sans heroin.  The changes I made in just those 2 weeks alone were pretty amazing and the outpouring of support I received from you guys was phenomenal.  I made another post 6 months ago as well sharing my success.

Well, [here I am again](http://imgur.com/gallery/i1ER27U) 6 days after marrying the love of my life on the beaches of Mexico at a 5 star adults only all inclusive resort.  This has been by far the best week of my life and to make it even more special yesterday morning I realized that it was my 1 year anniversary of being clean.  Without dope I was able to:

-help my husband and I move out of his parents house this past March and into our own cozy and love filled apartment
-plan my own wedding (with the help of my parents ofc) 
-keep the same job for a year and a half 
-plan and pay for our 6 night honeymoon in paradise
-finally find a PCP and I actually take vitamins every day now 😂
-went to the dentist for the first time in over half a decade (only 1 cavity, thank God I never let my oral health decline)
-build and maintain some pretty amazing friendships - my bridesmaids and I in particular have grown super close
-buy myself things when I need them or saving money instead of blowing all my money on drugs
-my relationships with family members are being repaired - my mom and I have never been closer and I feel like my dad and I are finally starting to understand one another
-lose 20 lbs - I go to the gym pretty much every day, have taken up swimming 
-my husband and I have started planning for a baby, will probably start trying at the start of the new year
-I have stopped living day to day.  I still try to live in the moment when I can but I spend a lot more time taking care of my future self than I have since I first started using

I could go on for hours but I think you get the point.  Yesterday as I was snorkeling and in awe of the natural beauty our world possesses I had a thought - a year ago I could hardly pull myself together enough to make it to my dad's lake house an hour away for a night or two, let alone get myself to a foreign country, drive a jetski out into the ocean (first time driving one btw!) to swim around with some of the most colorful marine life I have ever seen!  Part of why my recovery has been so successful is that I no longer suffer in silence, I share my struggles, experiences and victories with those around me, so here I am, sharing my story with you.

For those of you still struggling with an active addiction please know that it can get better.  I know it is such a cliche but you really have to want it.  I ""got clean"" more times than I can remember and the reason I was successful this time was because I finally got to the point where I knew I would lose everything I truly cared about if I didn't get my shit together and I just decided that was it.  No more ""just one more times"", I just made the choice to stop and while I do struggle with cravings that desire to live my best life is much stronger.  One thing I can say for sure - you cannot do it alone!  Get yourself into some kind of program, surround yourself with supportive (clean) people, stay busy.  I am here if anyone needs advice or just someone to talk to.

One final note - I just want to thank my wonderful husband for being the rock that I needed to get my life in order. You're the reason I am here today and I love you more than life itself.  I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you ❤️",jeanbeanmachine,self.happy,1566569604

happy,A new start has turned my life around 100% happy days are ahead with a successful road I feel it. Sit back and watch me as I continue to strive and grow and be the best mom and person I can be.,"Hello I have only learned about Reddit about 1 week ago and I love it I think it is a great way of having people who trully care about what is going on in a persons life. I'm surrounded by friends and family everyday and still have no one I can talk to. Now thanks to Reddit and all of you I have people that I can talk to that I feel whole heartedly care and will give the best advice without judgeing me or my decisions.

A little history about me is at age 16 I was anancipated and deemed a legal adult I grew up in a house of drugs all around me so I fought my mother in court and I won at 16 I became a legal adult and I went to my freshman year of highschool and maintained a full-time time and was the only one in school with my own apartment it was great. At 17 I took my mom back to court to get custody of my 12 year old brother and won. So now I had a full time job full time student full time mother of a 12 year old and maintained a household paying bills and grocery shopping everything that a mother has the responsibility of doing. My little brother today is an amazing person he is married now with 4 kids of his own and is the general manager at Jack in the box. I am so proud of him 

Well at the age 19 one month away from graduating high school I  met my kids father and we started partying and doing drugs I did not finish my senior year and dropped out my whole world was wrapped around this new boy in my life and before I knew it my life was nothing but drugs and him. At the age of 26 I had my first child and my mother was at this point using drugs with me and we lived together again my brother moved out and married at 18 so it was me and my man and my mom and a few other family members living helping to support each other's habbits. Getting pregnant slowed me down but after my son was born I just went right back to the drugs at the age of 29 I was pregnant with my daughter and I slowed down but only while I was pregnant 

Now when I turned 33 my mom was with my kids me and their dad split up and I never went home anymore just bounced from place to place using my body to earn money for my drugs my kids only saw me on their birthdays and holidays the very woman I took her son to raise as my own was now raising my 2 and my mom has her faults but I love her more than she will ever know for keeping my babies healthy and happy and being there when I was not. I was 36 when I woke up one morning and told my self no more I went home I went back to school 

Now I'm 38 years old for the first time I have my own 3 bedroom home with my two children. I live everyday for them I'm sober stopped using cold turkey never have been to any meeting or any rehabs I was just done and put the drugs down and walked away in a moment's time. I now have my high school completion where I graduated with a 3.92 GPA. I continued in school and received my Associates Degree in Medical Billing and Coding and was honored by being my class valid Victorian with a 4.0 GPA and am currently working towards receiving my Bachelor's Degree in healthcare information management and specializing in nursing home facility management. Still maintaining a 4.0.  

I was homeless with both my kids for 1 year and 5 months we lived in a tent in the desert CPS was called on me 7 times in that year and a half but I never lost my kids I just continued to do what I needed to do to continue to move forward. In this past December I learned of a homeless program called Jewish family services and I went to them and told them my situation and let them know I a was in the desert in a tent with my two children in about 45 days I got my key to my very own 3 bedroom house and my rent is only 154.00 a month and this Includes all my utilities my kids and I are at this moment closer and happier than ever and my life is turned around I have learned through all this that it is never to late to get your life back my kids are now 12 years and 9 years with many many issues that I gave my daughter abandonment issues she would get anxiety attacks daily scared to leave my side that I would not return my son was a problem in school refused to participate got suspended constantly if he even went to class I had to constantly stop and remember this was my fault my actions and my choice to never be there for them gave my kids behavorial problems I did not know how to handle gave my little girl issues that made her feel like she was not good enough to be loved.  I faced it everyday and it was heart breaking and very very hard to get through.

Today my son is an honor roll student my daughter sleeps in her own bed with no fear and I am about to start a new career.

Drugs is no longer a daily fight for me and my life is better than ever. I never thought as a teenage adult I would walk down the same path as my mom but I did it 10 times harder and selfishly than she ever did Drugs are a sickness like nobodies business but I am proof that there is life after addiction. Strong minded and determination was the 2 key things I kept on my side.   I'm so thankful everyday for the second chance I was givin it's never to late to get your life back. 

Thanks for listening to my story of my life.",sinfulthia,self.happy,1566453791

happy,"Today I found out I passed the NCLEX, and Im officially a Registered Nurse now!","All I've wanted over the past 6 years is to become a nurse. 

I had many set backs and disappoiting times. From having to take just one class at a time, going through 3 attempts to even get into a nursing program, having an advisor tell me that maybe I should reconsider going for nursing because I was on the lower end of grades compared to all others applying. Some semesters in the program were extremely hard and at times it didnt look like I would pass. 

But there were even better times! I finally got into a program, I did end up passing each semester to finally graduate! 

The NCLEX isnt a joke though! That was one of the hardest things I've done. 
The first attempt, I ended up taking all 265 questions and testing for 5 1/2 hours. I didnt pass, and ended up staying in bed for about three days because of it. 
I decided that I wasnt going to put myself through that again and really started to focus more while studying. 
My second attempt, I took 95 questions, and tested for 2 1/2 hours. And finally passed!


TL;DR. Took 6 years, had some set backs and some comebacks, but took the NCLEX for the 2nd time yesterday, and found out today that I passed. I am now a Registered Nurse!",oh_amberli,self.happy,1566415670

I have joint problems so bending down/crouching/squatting isn’t something that’s easy for me. My fiancé does virtually everything for me but today I suddenly got the idea to use my litter picker ‘grabby’ to grip the sponge so I could clean the shower out without having to bend, so I got my ass off the sofa and I did it! After that I sat down for a while and decided that all the crap on the bottom of the coffee table needed sorting out so I sat my ass on the floor and did a bit of organising, stood my ass up and went around litter picking all the mess up off the living room floor. 

The Tuesday just gone, I made the bed *mostly* on my own apart from the two top corners of the fitted sheet purely because it’s easier with two of us and my hands aren’t that great anymore. I was more active at work on Wednesday and Thursday and didn’t rely on my walking stick as much as usual.

I feel like I might actually be getting somewhere with my motivation and I’m so proud of myself. I’ve been pretty down lately waiting for scans to hopefully get a diagnosis that cleaning a shower out is such a win for me! I hope to do some dusting tomorrow and do some laundry, but if not, I’ve still got tonight to be proud of. Baby steps, and all that.",allupinmyfeelings,self.happy,1569029979

happy,I've always had a hard time with video games due to anxiety. Today I beat the Water Temple!!,"I'm sure this isn't a big deal at all since so many redditors grew up with these games, but I'm super excited. I didn't have consoles growing up and by the time I was an adult and old enough to buy and play them myself, the ol' millennial depression/anxiety cocktail had thoroughly reared its ugly head. Any time my friends (who did grow up playing them and were old pros by now) would try to introduce me to one of their favorite games, I was SO self-conscious and anxious that I couldn't remotely enjoy it. Not to mention I was so painfully terrible at them.

But lately, the anxiety is better controlled and I've found a good bit more self-confidence, so I've been slowly trying out more and more games. I've always heard that Ocarina was such a classic and a must-play...and also that the infamous Water Temple area was a source of massive frustration for so many gamers of my generation. I picked it up for the 3DS and I've been enjoying the hell out of it! And today I BEAT THE WATER TEMPLE all on my own with no hints or walkthroughs or anything!!

I'm so sorry for rambling...lol...but I'm just excited. I can finally enjoy these things that my friends have been going on about all this time. And now I'm gonna have some celebratory pizza. :)",gizmosdancin,self.happy,1569016026

I was their only desktop publisher for a while and we eventually hired somebody else from the same college, year after my class. This person has been absolute hell to work with for the past four years. My boss is pretty good,  but temper mental and demanding. I was getting $1.00 per year raises so I put up with it. 

Over the past 3 years, I got absolutely sick of my coworkers attitude and their arguing about every little thing, my boss doing nothing about it, and although I wasn't starving,  everybody was appalled at how low the pay was for what I did. 

Finally, I was offered a much better job, doing almost the same thing. MUCH better pay, less stress and undoubtedly better coworkers. Benefits, actual vacation, and non-working lunch breaks. 

Today is my last day. I care about my boss and I care about the shop, but I have tried so hard to help my coworker and I just can't do it anymore.

Well, I'm 33 and just got the message that I finished my bachelor's degree with a 1.8 :D! (In Germany, 1 is the best, 4 the worst - our rating goes to 6 but everything after 4 means ""failed"")

happy,I've been struggling with my mental health for years and I finally addressed it with medication and a bit of love for myself. Today I realised it is getting better.,"I have battled with my mental health for 15 years, at times I have self harmed, attempted suicide and yet I have never actually consistently taken medication.

This is part stubbornness and part not feeling like I'm worthy enough to look after myself.
I developed PTSD after a traumatic event 8 years ago, and around 2 years ago I had EMDR treatment and my symptoms massively reduced, but I still had all the residual anxiety, compulsions and self doubt left over that began in my teens. I just endured this, but it would always spiral when life got hard.

After working hard to get a job I love supporting other people, my mental health began to spiral after a relationship broke down. I began having panic attacks, I wasn't eating or sleeping and I felt so terribly about myself. I couldn't stop thinking destructive thoughts. I realised if I wanted to support people, I needed to put myself first.

I went back to the gym and rode that endorphin wave, I stopped eating rubbish food, I reconnected with friends who I love but have neglected. I made a pact with myself, not to enter into another relationship until I am happier and have gotten over the previous one. I made tangible plans to move out on my own with my cat, I get the keys 2 weeks tomorrow. I also bought a lot of plants. I began journalling and researching how to think about myself in a more positive way.

I went to the GP and was prescribed Sertraline and vowed to actually take it. Today I came across something that I know just two weeks ago would have made me spiral - BUT I DIDN'T. I felt a knock, but I was able to calm myself down and recover. I feel like I am thinking rationally about set backs and not taking them personally.

My appetite is back, I have more emotional energy and I feel much much more calm. My sleeping isn't there, but you can't have it all at once. I know there'll still be dips, but I am so happy and feel like I'm on the up. Finally. I feel happy more than I feel awful.

It is never too late to get help and no problem is ever too small to be addressed. If you are wondering if the pain you feel on a day to day basis should just be put up with - it shouldn't. There is no shame in getting help and I wish I could go back to 14 year old me and put her in treatment so I didn't have to feel so awful.",Beethovensnothere,self.happy,1568922662

happy,Free Life Coaching: Confidence and Happiness tip,"  

**Confidence tip #1: Don't take yourself so seriously!** 

**It's easy to get tripped up because we are overly self-conscious. We think people are scrutinizing how we look, judging what we say or do, or perceive us a certain way. The truth of it is most people are so self-absorbed, they're likely focusing much more on how they look, what they say or do, and how they appear. To an extent, it is just human nature. There may be some people who, because they have their own ""issues"" are judgmental of others, but that is their baggage. As a wise woman once told me (repeatedly until the message sunk in) ""What other people think of you is none of your business!"" ""Mind your own business"" (and carry on!)**

happy,4 months ago I tried to kill myself after my life went to hell. This morning I woke up next to the guy of my dreams. He’s everything I need.,"Sorry for the mushy post but I’m so fucking happy. I just need to tell someone.. I don’t exactly have the biggest support group in my life. 

He and I met in French class in high school 15 years ago. We never dated. Never hung out outside of class, not really. But we were always flirty and causing trouble, giving our teacher hell. I always thought he was a really great guy but I was preoccupied with my problems and we were just really young. I was a troubled kid. Compulsive. Lost. I don’t think I could grasp the concept of a relationship or anything at that time in my life, I was too busy destroying myself. Funny thing is that I didn’t even want to take French but in 6th grade my schedule got screwed up and I never made an effort to fix it (wanted to take Spanish) and ended up taking like 9 years of French collectively lol. Don’t even know if I’d be able to hold a conversation in French if I tried. But that’s the only reason we met, so I’m okay with it. 

After high school my life took a really ugly downward spiral. I only just now got my bachelors degree and I’m turning 31 in October. He got married. I sort of just watched his life from a distance via Facebook and Instagram. I was happy for him. I fell for someone who was too addicted to drugs to ever really make me the center of his universe. He died 3 years ago and I’ve been kicking myself ever since. I got sucked into a physically, sexually, psychologically and emotionally abusive relationship. Got out almost 4 years ago and it was one of my finest decisions. And then on my very last day of college I was in a school shooting. It took a really big toll on me... everything. I couldn’t handle life anymore. I didn’t want to. I was ready to just throw everything away... but I survived the suicide attempt and started rebuilding my life. Refused to ask for help. Was late on rent for 3 months straight, but made it out alive. I’ve slowly begun to put myself back together, but I’m not perfect. 

His now ex wife cheated on him and for whatever reason he reached out to me one night when I was at a low point. I almost didn’t respond because I was stuck in my head... but then we started talking and the rest is history. Yesterday I was sleeping and when I opened my eyes he was staring at me with the most incredible loving eyes I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t breathe for a second. Like molasses or whiskey or something else just as intoxicating and I was swept away. I’m free falling. 

He’s just my style. We fit together really well. We have a ton of fun and he makes me really happy. 

I’m sitting here smiling like a damn fool. My dog is laying at my feet and my guy is on his flight home. I won’t see him for a couple weeks. We live in different states but we’re making it work. All I know is that I don’t want to kiss anyone but him. I don’t want to wake up next to someone else. I don’t want to feel the pain I know I’d feel if I lost him. It’s like he’s a tornado that bulldozed into my life leaving nothing but sunshine. I’m head over heels. I’m really fucking happy. Thanks for reading, have a great night.",butterflyfrenchfry,self.happy,1568846850

I am finally doing well physically, cognitively, and psychologically where I can work (and hopefully get off of government money soon so I can start saving). I've been applying to just all summer with no luck due to my gap in work history. Yesterday, I took my resume and walked into my local grocery store and asked to talk to someone from HR... I got offered a job on the spot.

It was a bittersweet moment, given that I had to renounce the citizenship of my birth country, but nothing has ever felt so right and no place (in all my travels) has felt more like home. I knew the moment I came to the country that this was where I was meant to be, where my ideals of bravery, freedom and equality would be respected and valued. It took so much from me to maintain a dignified silence and not bawl my eyes out when taking the oath. But I did it!

Friends and family congratulate me, but to me, the real hard work starts now. 

In JFK’s very memorable words: And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.

happy,1 birthday gift turned into 5 free gifts!,"I just celebrated my birthday 2 weeks ago and my super awesome friend shipped me a Swell bottle to my college for my birthday. I was super excited to get it but it was sadly all scratched on the side. :( 

So I emailed Swell and they said they would send a replacement bottle. I asked for it in a different color since I was afraid the light color would scratch again. 

They accidentally sent the same color to my friends home address (nice free bottle for them!). I alerted Swell of this error and they tried to correct it and send me the right color. Only they sent it to my friends house again (free bottle #2 for them). They finally got it right and sent me the right color to my college. I was so happy I got 2 bottles for my bday. Just when I thought it was over, ANOTHER bottle came to my house in the new color. 

If you lost track, I now have 3 brand new Swell bottles at my house, and my friend has 2 bottles as well. That is $175 worth of water bottles off of a $35 purchase.

happy,Just overheard my boyfriend refer to me as his future fiancee!,"My boyfriend and I have been looking for a new car for a variety of reasons. We've also been discussing marriage for awhile now. My parents are very controlling and won't allow us to marry until we've done a list of things they want. We're also not allowed to share a room or sleep together. We can't even use the same bathroom.  We are currently living with them because it's cheap and we want to build a house together eventually and while they are toxic at times and controlling they do genuinely care about my well being and love my boyfriend like their own child. 

Well my boyfriend was in his room, and I guess he didn't think I could hear him? But I was in the kitchen cooking. It's a fair distance but I could still hear clearly. I turned off my music because I heard him talking and I couldn't tell if he was calling me to look at something. I knew he was shopping for cars so I thought maybe he found one. But when I paused to hear him, I heard him talking and figured out he was on the phone. I shrugged and went back to cooking I don't tend to Eve's drop but he did kinda get a little loud so I couldn't really help it. Like I said it's a pretty good distance from where I was to his room, and I didn't move. He told the person on the phone he looking for a car for his girlfriend but then he paused for a second and chuckled a little and was like ""well....my future fiancée."" And he genuinely sounded excited! 

I have issues with depression and had been feeling pretty down lately. I start to isolate myself and that just makes it worse. I start feeling unwanted and lonely, not because of what others do but because of how I interpret things. It felt really good and made me really happy to hear how excited he got when he was talking about me. Calling me future fiancée was just icing on the cake. It really made my day, especially with how work went this morning.",GuiltyEnigma,self.happy,1568752460

happy,I have recieved so much recognition for my hard work this year. I can't not smile when thinking about it.,"Over the years I haven't always been super happy with my life and have felt like shit a lot but this past year was the best year of my life. At school I finished my first two semesters of college and made the deans list both times which was amazing for me since I thought that college was going to kick me down but I killed it and am hopefully going to keep killing it. Then at my job at the end of the school year in May we had a banquet and they gave out some awards to staff members and I got the Rookie of the Year award, and will have my name on a plaque in our office on campus. Then over the summers I have spent the past 5 summers working at a Boy Scout Camp that I used to go to making this past summer my 9th summer there, and it was the 100th anniversery of the camp. I honestly work my ass off at that camp and I love that place more than anywhere else in the world. This summer I made amazing friends, took the friendships I already ahd and grew them exponentially, and while it may seem silly but I also got my first kiss this summer so that rocked. But most importantly at that place I call home, this past summer they named me the Reservation Staff Member of The Year, the highest award anyone can get at that camp. I was so proud of that moment. The second I started walking back to my seat after recieving my certificate people just started hugging me and were so happy for me. Then my boss who recommended me for the award came up to me crying and I just stared crying the happiest tears I have ever cried, he told me how proud he was of me and all my close friends started hugging me and everything. It was easily the best moment of my life, and I can't wait to go back next summer and see my name on a plaque in our dining hall, and that plaque has some of the most amazing staff memebers I know on there and I was so honored to join their ranks. Just thinking about all of this is making me tear up honestly. This year I finally got recognized for all of the hard work I do in my life, and I got to make some memories that will last me a life time. I can't really say it out loud because it sounds selfish but I am so proud of myself and everything I have accomplished this year, I never thought my life would end up where it is today but I am glad I am where I am, and I honestly wouldn't change a thing.

happy,Things are falling into place for me for the first time in a while and I am so happy about it that I feel the need to share (lol),"This is my first post on this sub - you are all so amazing!

So here’s the deal, I’m a junior at an incredible university majoring in Human Resource Management - only problem is that I hate human resource management lol. 

Going into uni, I had no clue what I wanted to major in and HR seemed convincing and the fact that I am a people person made it seem like a decent fit. Over the last 2 years I have had 3 INCREDIBLE internships at very well known and large scale companies but I was absolutely miserable at all of them. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was only 11 years old and after starting college, it got severe and led me down a very dark and depressing path. I cut myself off from my friends, family, peers, and just about anything fun. It was bad. 

I figured, let me just get my degree and figure it out maybe it’ll grow on me. Fast forward to this past summer and I got a very random opportunity through a family friend to intern at a Superior Court in a judges chambers. From the first day of this internship, I absolutely loved it and truly believe that I have found what I was meant to do. I always had an interest in law and the legal system but never knew where to get started. Now, my internship has been extended to the fall semester and the judge PERSONALLY said that he sees incredible potential in me as an attorney which means a lot coming from him (he’s a pretty big deal). 

Fast forward again to this afternoon where I used the money I made from this summer to buy very expensive but necessary books to start studying for the LSAT and have already begun research on law schools that are likely within my reach. 
 
I have never been this happy and PROUD of myself. For some, this may seem silly of me and you may be thinking “well yeah - a lot of people find something they love and want to pursue”. I never thought this would happen for me. I was prepared to sit in an office for the rest of my life and become a robot. I am so excited for myself and this journey I am beginning.

happy,A realization I've made about staying happy,"I was watching a Joe Rogan clip on youtube (I wish I could find it) about happiness, and what he said really really resonated with me. I'll try my best to remember/recreate what he had said.

He used an example of two kids. The first one was given a lamborghini in high school, and at the time, kid #1 was probably the happiest teenager alive, but when the kid goes off to college, the lambo has to be sold and replaced with a new BMW. It's still a whole ass BMW, but kid #1 is kinda bummed, as he had a lambo in high school.

Kid #2 instead is given a 1998 Honda Civic through high school, was still happy, but maybe not as happy as kid #1, but then kid #2 is given the same new BMW in college. Kid #2 is really excited, as he just upgraded from his Civic to a new BMW.

Both kids are at the exact same point in their life: in college with a BMW. Yet kid #2 is much happier than #1. You'd be mistaken if you think they should be equally happy since we find our happiness in comparison, whether it's with what we used to have or what others have.

This completely shook me, and it related to where I'm currently at too. I recently moved to a university in a new state after living in the same town for 18 years, leaving behind everything I've ever known. I was about to go to a large state school, where I would've been with my long-term girlfriend and would have already had a group of friends. I love trying new things, but I wasn't ready for literally *everything* to be new. Nonetheless, I chose the out of state school for its superior program in the field I'm studying. I left behind my best friends and (what's given me more trouble) my long-term girlfriend. This girl was gorgeous, caring, and legitimately everything I could've asked for, but we chose to go our own ways and break up since we were attending different universities. 

But in these first few weeks, I've met such an incredible group of people, and I really should have no reason to be sad. If I was a social outcast in high school, I would be the happiest person alive right now with just the friends I have now, but since I'm looking back at what I had and what it could be, I'm being unreasonably bogged down.

Just making this realization has really helped me, and my message to all of you is to not let best be the enemy of better.",kunmeh13,self.happy,1567971350

happy,"After being made to feel like a constant failure in my past relationships, my fiance just yesterday encouraged me sign up for the course I dropped out of 3 years ago","A lot of back story, tw Idk... Oh and Tldr at the end if you don't want to read my life story lmaooo

Please be kind, this is difficult to talk about but I share as part of recovery (PTSD) and in the hope of trying to help some else realise they can defeat their demons if they keep fighting hard enough for long enough.

 I had a really rough childhood, was abused an neglected. This encouraged me to get into bad relationships. When I was 17 I had nothing to life far, so depressed smoking pot all the time. I decided having a baby might give me more purpose, someone who really loved me and force me to get back on track. (I know, what a cliche)

The guy I had my child with was/is a terrible man and hasn't been in our lives since my son was about 8mo. He constantly broke me down abused me and made me feel like less than the dirt on his shoe. Then he did something utterly unforgivable to me and after a couple months of getting my bravery, I kicked him out. 

18 and on the rebound from a traumatic relationship I fell straight into the arms of another abuser, this one was different though. To start with he was so sweet, he had a hard time lately too so I wanted to help him. He knew this and he preyed on this. I was in a very bad place and wanted an open relationship as an excuse to self destruct through impulsive sexual behavior and excessive alcohol consumption. He used this against me instead of helping me understand why I was doing what I was doing. He abused me to the point where I no longer wanted to live. He was/is a drug addict and I fell into heavy pot smoking during this time too. I threw him out more times than I can count but he always wormed his way back in. I finally decided I had to leave if I wanted any peace for me and my son. So I left. I was 19, he was 34 if memory serves. 

I lived with my mother for a short time as I had nowhere else to go. She is a drug addict but I never realised the depths of her mental instability until I moved back in with her. She berated me constantly made me feel like a terrible mother for falling apart and not functioning. She'd agree to look after my son and promise she wouldn't be getting high but then would and would abuse me for leaving my son with her like I forced her to do it. She tried to beat me on at least two occasions. It wasn't safe for us there and I was desperate to get out.

A friend said I could stay with her but this invitation only lasted a week and I was homeless with my son, in emergency accommodation at a motel. I couldn't handle my life anymore. I had to get out or I'd never survive. So I left. I got someone who I thought was a friend (met online) to come over from another state and take me to somewhere where I could have a fresh start... Or so I thought... 

We ended up living in a house he was actually a flatmate in. It was his friend's mother's house and he paid a bit of rent. He promised me he'd help me find a house and help me get back on my feet bit all he wanted from me is what most people would think he'd expect in return for rescuing a damsel in distress. And I gave it to him because I felt I had no other choice but that or homelessness on the streets of a big city where I knew nobody and winter was around the corner. 

The friend I had lived with for a week in my hometown had moved to the same city in this time and she told me to come live with her. I did and it was stressful, she had two young kids and I had my one. Living with her lasted about six weeks before she told me I had to leave right before Easter. I convinced her to let me stay until just after so the homeless support services would be more operational. 

I found myself in another motel, homeless and scared. 

I had spoken about what was happening with another newly made online friend (talk for maybe a month) and he told me he lived three hours away but as luck would have it him and two of his daughters were at a friends place just around the corner from my motel. I was shit scared for good reason but I agreed to meet up an go for dinner together with one of his daughters. I felt so at ease and comfortable. 

We went back to where he lived after a few days of hanging out and we lived with him until we got a place of our own. Me and him had a weird friendship and after a few big ups an downs and him helping me work through some intense stuff we got together. 

It's now been almost two years since we got together and he's the best thing to ever happen to me. He's held my pieces together while I've set them with glue and together we are both healing from our sorted pasts and helping heal our children too. We are both in such an amazing place now from such tough times in our pasts. Through being so loved and comfortable, a lot of my forgotten trauma has decided to try and run the show and wreck havoc on my mental state but he has been there every step, every tear and every panic attack of the way. He is my inspiration to keep going and my rock in the storm.  

Yesterday he convinced me that I'm good enough and talented enough to get back into the beauty course I dropped out of years ago, they start taking enrollments in October but today I finally got the balls up to send in an enquiry for an info pack and for information on how to transfer my previous completed modules of work. If I can enrol I'll be starting I'm February and I'll be one step closer to reaching my dream of starting my own business one day. 

Our next steps are working towards me being brave enough to call my maternal grandparents who my mother convinced me were evil my whole life (surprise, they aren't), getting a new car, new place and both of us getting healthy so we can be here for a long ass time for our kids and to enjoy our best life together.

I've made mistakes, I've been treated badly, here I am fighting on, trying my hardest. Some days are worse than others but I have the best man in the world and an amazing psychologist. I'm so proud of myself and how much I've turned my life around, it's been so hard but do worth it. I know who I am, I'm a good mother, I'm a good person.


If I can do it, you can do it, no matter how hard your life is, how much the chips are stacked against you, there is always a way through, a way forward. You can be the person you always hoped to be, just choose. Choose to get up and see what you can do rather than what you can't. Choose to try and find the good in every moment. Know who you are and fight for what is right. I believe in you. 


Tldr: had a bad life, lots of mistakes and bad treatment. Life is now everything I've wanted and more. You can do it too, be brave and seize the day. 


If you read all of this, thank you, you're amazing.
If you didn't read all of this, it's okay, you're amazing.


Have a great day, night, afternoon, whatever.

Here's the link if you want to take a look at it: https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ao4n5r/going_through_a_really_tough_time_regarding_my/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'm back home now, lying down on the bed. Guess what? I had one of the best times of my life. We laughed so hard the entire time that at the end of the day, our cheeks were hurting and yet we couldn't stop laughing. I gifted her a handwritten poem (which I created last night for her) and she seemed so happy looking at it.

And to add to it all, she gave me so many hugs on our way back in the cab, and even gave me a kiss on my cheek. I couldn't help but kiss her forehead and she blushed. She said she had such an awesome time and we're both looking forward to hanging out some time in the future again.

I'd have the best sleep of my life tonight.

happy,I am finally free,"For the past year and a half, my parents had me going to religious ed every sunday for 2 hours. I love my parents but I hated religious ed. I don't believe in god and they know this, but they still felt I should go. I would endure it every weekend, but silently dread every saturday night knowing when I woke up I would have to go to church. I was nice, I didn't throw a fit because I knew it would embarrass my parents. But I hated it, and I didn't totally know why. It just felt awful.

Fast foward to last week when we had to go to a confession. I told the priest that I didn't believe in god and was just waiting for this to be over. I expected him to be upset for he knew me and my parents well as religious role models, but instead he suggested I let him talk to my parents. I knew this wouldn't work for I had tried time and time again but I asked him to do it anyway. A week later I had totally forgot about the conversation until my parents came home with a frown. They werent totally happy about it, but they agreed to let me decide if I wanted to go to church or not. I cannot stop grinning. I now look forward to weekends, and am somewhat of a happier person myself.

tl;dr Priest talked to my parents and now I don't have to go to church school every sunday.

I have a serious illness that can really knock me over, but the grass was two feet tall so it had to be done. 

I managed to get half done, and my heart started going crazy and I had to lie down on the concrete by our lawn. My five year old son who was watching, came and sat down beside me, started patting my hair, and told me I was very good for working so hard. 

I told him I needed a little rest because my chest hurt, and asked him to get me a glass of water, and he soon came back, with a water and one of his own treats from his snack box.

He said he bought me a treat for doing a good job, and that it was okay if I wanted to take a nap.

I've had depression for so long, and I'm so scared about the future - I'm entering University this month, and my son starts school the same day! - but this was the first time in a while that I felt things were going to be okay.

As soon as I got orders I promised myself I would do whatever I can to stick up for the little guy at work (something that is rarely done) until I left. So that's what I did in one special circumstances where an employees (and personal friends) name was being drug through the dirt. I did the wrong thing by the corporate mentality. But I know I did the right thing by the employee (and those privy to the situation agree.) Things got messy and my corporate office's response was to suspend all parties involved for breach of confidentiality. My boss said we could fight the suspension and I told him that I'd rather stand by what I did then get special treatment. I signed those suspension papers and walked out smiling. No matter how ugly things look for you, no matter what feelings are hurt, never EVER fail to stick to your guns. At the end of the day you only report to one person. You only owe one person an explanation. You only have to look at one face in the mirror every day. Do the right thing, take care of those who matter. Watch out for the little guy, and you'll walk away feeling like I did for once: proud of yourself. You won't change the world, but you'll solidify the belief in yourself that when the chips are down, your moral compass stayed true. Thanks for those who read.

We were in a pretty great relationship for nearly two years and had one of those horrible childhood friends relationships, every day we'd spend 2-5 hours just talking. Eventually she moved for college and got what I would consider a full time job; eventually we did exactly what anyone could predict, we drifted. 

I tried to cut off most of our contact in all honesty but I found myself often thinking back to how much I missed her and how lonely I had became.

For some reason seeing that small insignificant emoji beside her name disappear was almost like a sign to me. I felt as if something was signifying that this new chapter was definitely a new chapter and there's not much I can do to stop it and honestly, that's the most refreshing though I've had in awhile.

happy,"when you fail, try &amp; try again! got my first lab job after months of searching :)","as a freshman coming to school out of state, there’s been a lot of pressure to make the most of my education given the exorbitant amount of money i’m spending on it.

i’m currently studying bioengineering: bioinformatics, and have always wanted to do something research-oriented. my main goal my freshman year was to get into a lab.

so i spent hours on hours searching for labs i was interested in, and carefully creating cover letters and tailored resumes for each job position. 

i applied to twelve different places on campus over the course of four months- that was twelve different cover letters and emails crafted (aka, a crap ton of work while going to school full time).

out of those twelve applications, i received three interview offers, one of which was borderline rude (interviewer literally said my grandfathers dead should not have affected my SAT score and that my scores on standardized testing were indicative of my life’s success), and no offers to work unpaid and for experience.

at this point m, i’d pretty much lost all hope. i applied to two more places, and had an interview for a position and a local institute today.

the interview ends and after, the principal investigator asked me how long i could stay. i was confused and asked why. he looked at me and told me, “training, duh.”

i received the job, as well as an offer to stay over the summer on a a stipend to work full time. needless to say i am beyond excited to start, and wanted to share this happy story for anyone whose applying for jobs right now, may it be for a lab or anything else, to keep on going regardless of the situation.

something good will come your way!!

happy,I used the phone to call Wendy’s - and it’s the first time I didn’t feel like I was going to throw up.,"Hear me out. My phone is always on do not disturb. I’ll answer if it’s someone I’m close to—certain family members, a couple friends. But, mostly, if you call me, I’m really sorry but you’re going to voicemail. I’ll text you later. 

So, I started a job a few months ago, and it sometimes requires me to call people. And, honestly, I’m just so bad at it and it freaks me out to the point of dizziness and nausea. When people first started calling me, once training was over, I would freeze up and say some whack shit or accidentally hang up. My phone etiquette  and speaking ability when I’m not face-to-face with someone is so bad that I really don’t know how I’ve made it this far in life. 

These past few months have been emotionally rocky for me as I’ve struggled with this. 

Today, I called Wendy’s. On my own. I didn’t ask someone else to do it for me.  I didn’t prowl the internet for an answer. I called Wendy’s and I said: “Hey, do you have that maple chicken sandwich at your location?”

And he said, “Yeah we got that for a couple more days.”

“Okay cool, thanks, man.”

“Yep. Bye bye.”

“Bye bye.”

I’m just over the moon because this is the first time I’ve done something like this. I let it ring and I didn’t feel my chest constrict, or my stomach convulse. Someone answered and I didn’t panic and have to think about what to say. I didn’t have a script already written out, like I’ve had to do for those unavoidable phone calls. 

I’m just happy.

**The advantages of the physical activity of older people**

Regular physical exercise reduces the risk of developing many diseases, including:

&amp;#x200B;

cardiovascular diseases,

stroke,

hypertension,

type 2 diabetes,

osteoporosis,

overweight and obesity,

constipation,

breast and colon cancer,

depression,

cognitive disorders and dementia diseases,

Physical activity also improves the mobility of the elderly and reduces the risk of related diseases. In addition, it eliminates the feeling of chronic pain, mood disorders and/or sleep disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

Regular physical activity is at the same time the most effective method of preventing the reduction of muscle mass and their function related to the aging of the body (sarcopenia).

How should older people practice?

The physical effort of an elderly person should be adapted to the possibilities and condition of their health. Elderly people should exercise above all according to their abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical effort is not only planned movement exercises, but also daily activities - doing everyday household activities, such as cleaning, activities related to work and transport (walking, cycling).

&amp;#x200B;

**How should older people start a physical activity?**

In the case of starting physical activity, the saying: ""a novice chef lunges on a deep fat"", unfortunately, does not work. People with low physical activity should start with a small ""dose"" of physical effort and gradually increase - the frequency, duration, and intensity of physical exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

In many cases, limiting the sedentary lifestyle, i.e. the minimum increase in activity, instead of the full implementation of the recommendations may be more appropriate, especially for people who can not perform the recommended amount of physical exertion, or are particularly reluctant.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical activity and oxygen exertion

Oxygen effort involves large muscle groups. It should last for at least 10 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of physical activity that provides oxygen work:

quick march,

running (so-called jogging),

swimming,

tennis,

golf (without the use of a pram),

water aerobics,

aerobics (group classes),

Cycling,

dance,

Exercises using cardiovascular equipment (eg a stationary bike).

Physical activity and resistance effort

Resistance effort or effort to strengthen skeletal muscles, which aims to maintain and increase muscle strength. It should be performed at least twice a week and cover 8 to 10 major muscle groups.

  

[Buy Medicine Online for saving money in a pocket with 20% Discount](https://gomedii.com)

These exercises do not have a specific duration, only each exercise should be repeated about 10-25 times. The effort should be progressive, i.e. the load should be gradually increased along with the duration of the training.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of physical activity that provides oxygen work:

strength training,

resistance training,

Weightlifting.

&amp;#x200B;

For resilient, strengthening exercises, you can use, for example, small dumbbells (weighing 0.5-1 kg), flexible red tape and/or a small bottle with water.

&amp;#x200B;

Resistance effort influences the increase in muscle strength and physical fitness.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, only 11% of men and 14% of women over 65 carry out any strength training.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical activity and stretching exercises

Stretching exercises are important for maintaining good physical health. The impact of this type of exercise is poorly researched, but it seems necessary, however, to be able to perform everyday activities (eg, putting on socks).

&amp;#x200B;

Stretching exercises should be performed for at least 10 minutes 2 times a week. Stretching should be performed after aerobic or resistance exercise when the body is adequately warmed up. Stretching should be based on holding in a given position for 10-30 seconds, but one should not extend to the point of pain sensation.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of physical activity involving stretching exercises:

stretching,

yoga.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical activity and equivalent exercises

Equivalent exercises are designed to improve posture stability and prevent falls and related injuries. They are targeted especially at people who have already been injured because of a fall or who have difficulty in moving. It is recommended to do exercises equivalent to at least 3 times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of physical activity involving equivalent exercises:

tai chi.

Planning physical activity by the elderly

A well-planned workout will allow the practitioner to avoid injuries. The way exercises are performed and their duration is important.

&amp;#x200B;

Oxygen effort should be performed once for at least 10 minutes (at a frequency depending on the intensity of the effort).

Resistance exercises aimed at increasing the strength of skeletal muscles, including the main groups of muscle groups, should be performed at least twice a week.

Stretching exercises should be performed at least twice a week for at least 10 minutes.

Exercises aimed at improving balance and preventing falls should especially be performed by elderly people with poor motor skills, at least 3 times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yoga as a form of physical activity for the elderly

Yoga affects not only the body but also mind and behavior. It consists of three basic elements:

&amp;#x200B;

the right attitude,

breath control

meditation (relaxation).

Why is it worth to do yoga?

Regular yoga exercises:

&amp;#x200B;

allow increasing muscle strength (at a similar level as resistance exercise),

increase the range of muscle movement (at a similar level to stretching),

improve posture stability,

they can be helpful in relieving feelings of stress and anxiety,

can have a positive effect on the quality of life,

can support cognitive functions, also in the case of mild cognitive impairment,

relieve back pain, as well as can be used as a method of supporting analgesic treatment,

they may be helpful in relieving symptoms in the course of rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly to starting any other type of physical activity, starting from low-intensity yoga training and gradually increasing it over time seems to be the optimal method of reducing the risk of injuries. However, only about 0.6% of Americans practicing yoga experienced injuries that contributed to the abandonment of training.

happy,"I finally told my crush that I really liked her, and now we’re officially dating!","Ever since about two years ago when I met this girl, I’ve had my feelings towards her grow tremendously.  She always makes me smile, laugh, and she just makes me happy to be around her. We’ve gone out together before, but never officially as a date. Fast forward to last night, when we actually went on a date. I took her out to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we had a ton of fun, we saw a movie she really wanted to see. Then it all accumulated at the end of our date. Even though she probably could already guess, I didn’t want any more ambiguity. I wanted to tell it to her straight. So I did. I told her that I really like her, that I really enjoy the time we spend together, and that I want to keep going out like that. And at first I was worried. I think it was because she might’ve been taken by surprise, but at first she kinda turned away from me. But then, my fears all went away when she told me that she also likes spending time with me like this, she also wants to keep going on dates with me. She told me that, before me, she’s never gone out with someone like this. It made me feel really special. It was an ending to our date that I couldn’t be any happier about. With those words, she made me the happiest man in the world. And with that, unfortunately, we both had to leave for the night. We said goodnight, we gave each other a nice long hug, and we left, ending one of the best days of my life.

happy,I am blessed with the best boyfriend I could ask for and it has made me happier than I have felt in YEARS,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to say I am new here so sorry if the formatting is a bit off or any of this is weird but I needed to get it out somewhere. 

I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) for over a year and I can easily say this is the happiest I have ever been. I wake up every day and look over at him and cannot help but get the biggest smile on my face. He is so supportive with everything I do and he helps me work towards achieving my goals and keeps me grounded when my mental health is dipping down. I could go on and on and on for days. I am really insecure about my weight but he reassures me all the time that he loves me and how I look and he likes to make sure I never forget it. Yesterday morning, I woke up to a surprise breakfast in bed of homemade breakfast burritos with all of my favorite ingredients and later on in the day when I was having really bad cramps, he went out and got me “yummy comfort food” which made me feel better. We have spent the past week watching Avatar together every night because I have never seen it all the way through, and it is honestly one of my favorite activities we have done in a while. 

I’m really not sure if these are the types of things posted here, so I am sorry if this rambling nonsense is off, but I just can’t hold it in any longer. I am so happy for the first time in so long and I just wanted to share.",istoleyourcats,self.happy,1595499968

My university journey has been far from average, and I was very pleased when I knew that I would finish my 3 years with a 2:1 classification. However, I opened my laptop this afternoon to find I have graduated with a 1st class degree, not even slightly, I was 2.5% into the grade. I am so ecstatic!!

happy,Just got accepted for a new job that I truly didn’t think I had a chance at! So happy I could cry!,"I applied on a whim, never imagining I’d get an interview, let alone HIRED! It’s a non-profit organization that helps people adjust to life and rebuild after being incarcerated, or struggling with drug habits. Due to some family history, it’s a cause I feel very strongly about and am so honored to be a part of!

The cherry on the top is that they provide their employers entire paid tuition towards getting their Bachelors Degree, so I can finally start school and get my social work degree, and be one step closer towards becoming a case worker!

I was sure I butchered the interview, I was so nervous! But I just got the call that they want to hire me! I feel so bad leaving my current job, as they are really understaffed as it is... but this is the opportunity of a lifetime! I am still in shock! I am waiting for them to call back and say they mistook me for someone else, haha!

Just wanted to gush to someone! I’m at work right now, and can’t wait to go home and celebrate with my honey!

He basically told me “if you wanna be with me, you have to know what it’s like.” So wanting him to like me, i tried it. And i liked it. I liked it too much. I started using it more and more until eventually i was using it every day. By the time i was 15 i had started shooting up. I thought i was addicted when i was smoking it but slamming is a whole other ball game. Anyway, after 2 trips to rehab, and countless relapses, i finally got clean. My best friend passed away from an overdose while i was in rehab the 2nd time, and i think that kinda helped snap me out of it a bit. Seeing what addiction can really do. I got news the other day that the guy who got me started on meth, my first love, had overdosed. I’m still kinda in shock about it. I know it comes with the territory but it’s just so awful. Addiction is evil. It’s a killer. It’s insidious and spiteful. But i am so fucking grateful to be alive. I’m an anomaly and I honestly feel like me not using for this long is miraculous. I’m so appreciative to my support system and just so glad to be alive. Just having a roof over my head and food to eat is so much better than how it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with the same security company for almost two years, and they've lied to me about raises, new position opportunities, and countless other things that would fall in line with having a good corporate office. Last February I picked up a 2nd job at GameStop to make life a little more livable, money wise. I've spent the last year looking for a new job to replace the need for both of them, and found dead end after dead end. No one wanted to pay me anything that would be worth it. I was working 70 hours a week for what would be equal to $16.20 an hour at 40 hours a week.

But a few weeks ago, my friend dropped a line and said that his employer was looking for someone new and ready to learn. This job requires me to move from Cincinnati to Columbus and leave behind everything I've known for the last \~22 years of my life to make over $20 an hour and actually be allowed to work overtime. And it finally feels like things are working out in my favor.

happy,I really love all the people i’ve met so far in my life even though I’m still young and I still have a whole world of people to meet and how they all inspire me even in the smallest way,"Let me start this rant by saying that I get really passionate about things to the point where sometimes I’ll be thinking about it and my heart goes heavy and tears start to form in my eyes. Even the smallest things will make me really emotional. Well I listen to a lot of punk / hardcore music and everyone in the scene is so nice and they all try to help one another whether it be taking photos for them, filming videos, making tour poster or just helping them with their music everyone helps one another. It really feels like a big family. Music is my family and everyone in it means the world to me. My family isn’t the closest and really they only started to get ‘close’ when something terrible happened two years ago. I know my parents love me and I know they work really hard to make sure I have the best life, but it’s hard for them to communicate that sometimes. One of my friend has parents who really shows it and sometimes it makes me a little jealous, but I know deep inside my parents care and they just show it in a different way. Anyway music is like my second home and I’ve made friends with some of my favorite bands and they mean so much to me. It really is the greatest feeling to have people you look up to, people who inspire you and help you get up on days you don’t want to be your friend. I don’t know if they know the impact they have on me, but they do. Music helps me cope when terrible things happen and when there isn’t anyone to talk to. It makes me a better person and it inspires me everyday to do as much as I can in this life. My parents don’t understand the music that I listen to or why I go to so many shows, but that’s fine. They may not like the people in the scene because they have tattoos and piercings and that’s fine, as intimidating they all look, they are the sweetest people. I don’t really know where I was going with this, but this is just one of those nights where I really appreciate everyone and all of my friends.",twinpeaks10,self.happy,1555928592

happy,I Set A Boundary.,"I recently visited someone who I thought could be a possible friend. I'm very isolated and alone. I'm working on it, and my current challenge is that I tend to stick around longer with certain individuals most people would definitely leave after being around very shortly. I wrongly think I'm the one who has to ""suck it up"". Regardless of their lack of interest in me, their bad habits, rudeness, invalidation and putting down, or unhealthiness. As a result, I have unspeakable rage -- that I try VERY hard to, but rarely channel into healthy assertive action. But this person was pretty supportive and thoughtful in a past specific environment so I agreed to meet them after a couple years. Well, they changed. 

The hangout was pretty bad. 

\[can skip if don't wan't details\]

&gt;Most times when I tried to speak, they replied with a completely different topic, one about themselves in long stories without stopping much for me to join in, and the only times I could even make a sound was when the person stopped to drink or look at their phone. I'd often begin to speak, but they'd bulldoze through without hearing me. I often very audibly asked happy, lighthearted questions to propel balanced conversations, and they often didn't even respond. Like literal SILENCE after being asked a conversational question. Sometimes while looking at their phone, sometimes acting as if they didn't even hear me. And trust me, I was within 2 feet of them the whole time, and every place we walked or sat was quiet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, they started asking me a lot of way too personal questions involving finance, where I get my money, and word for word said: ""do you use your mom's credit card for everything?"" Later, the person kept repeating over and over that ""we should start a creative business together"", mentioning they don't know how to use a computer, do art, or create anything, but they know how to do ""everything else"". Then, they kept saying I should either move to their place and help them clean their apartment and work on everything (portfolios, job, entire life) together. They kept mentioning they could move to my place as well. Kept saying we don't have to, but ""you should sleep over at my place, I could sleep over at yours, sometimes we could hang out for a whole two days"".   
&gt;  
&gt;Btw, we're the same gender. This is not a date. And this is the first time we saw each other in 2 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;And I said ""OK"" to everything as the person blurted everything out so fast. In the end... I told thanked them for hanging out with me. We both expressed we'd meet again.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like utter empty, cowardly, disrespected shit. 

All those inner pep talks to say ""no"" on the spot were blown.

But yesterday, I decided to put my foot down. Instead of letting go with ambiguous silence, I tried something new.

I utilized my anger and gave them a piece of my mind by texting them exactly how they were inappropriate, explained how I felt, told them I am moving on for me, said I'm just letting them know this so they know what happened between us, and then I wished them well. I set up online and offline boundaries and they cannot contact me again.

It's true that I could've not done anything and nope'd out.

But I need to start somewhere. This would be the starter for getting used to speaking up on the spot which is my ultimate goal.

if I think in my deathbed of the times I stood up for myself, at least I have one so far.",ulj1Ivh,self.happy,1555127718

I've had my psychopath of a mother emailing me nonstop, don't have anything for dinner later, can't afford a couple things, and won't be able to get myself a gift this year. But goddammit, I got to play with dogs. 

I used to have one as a kid and he was my best friend. Hands down. My mother gave him away without me saying goodbye. Kinda broke my heart. Ever since then I've had a very special spot in my heart for dogs. They're so pure and happy and innocent. If I get to pet a dog once, my day is much better.

happy,"On Tuesday, April 9, 2019 I had a stroke was admitted to the hospital, and I survived!","Like the title states, this past Tuesday I had a stroke and was immediately admitted to the hospital.
I’m a 29 year old woman, fairly healthy, living in Ontario Canada and this was hardly my first brush with death. 

I’ve also had open heart surgery in April 2013 for mitral valve prolapse repair, I had surgery for an ovarian cyst removal later that year in December (Merry Christmas to me!), this past summer 2018 I had deep vein thrombosis in my left leg (which with the help of my family doctor was treated) and as a few days ago the surprise strokes that rocked my life. 
After exhibiting symptoms such as losing some of my use of my left hand, trouble speaking, and unable to smile properly,  they performed a CT scan in my hometown which is how they were able to confirm it and then transferred me a couple hours away via ambulance while giving me a clot buster (not sure of the name) and when I arrived at the larger hospital they were happy to confirm that the clot busters had worked and didn’t need to perform anymore procedures to remove the clot. 
I had to spend a few days in the hospital in which time they took more blood than I knew I even had in my body (jokes), another CT scan, multiple EKG’s, an ultrasound to make sure my heart was all good and an MRI.
With the help of those tests they were able to tell me that I had 3-4 small strokes on the right side of my brain, which apparently impacts my memory because i cannot remember anything properly right now. 

As of now I’m just so happy to be home. My arms are tender from where the IVs were used, and I feel like I could sleep for a year, but if i never have to be asked my full name, today’s date, where I am, whether or not you peel a banana before you eat it, if I drop a rock in water will it sink, and names and functions for various things such as pens, watches, keys, and flashlights, I will be happy.

happy,I just finished writing the first episode to the first cartoon in the history of my country.,"I can't get into details for obvious reasons but after a week long battle with anxiety I pulled through. I cleared all of my distractions out of my house (my ps4, I'm a huge gamer.)  and dug in.  Not gonna lie though there were a series of writer's block and the occasional ""what the fuck am I doing? "" feeling in my gut part way through. I did have to call for support from my teammates and my Mum, I was freaking out. But after the group met up for a mini writers summit and I got some verbal notes it really helped move the process along. 

Like I said before there were a lot of starts and stops and I even called in to work (really don't wanna make a habit of that.) but dammit I got it done. On a funnier note not gonna like smoking a blunt really helped with the anxiety and the creative flow, not making any claims just saying.

The come across a mysterious artifact and now they have to balance life, school and their new discovery.

The little pooch follows me around the house, to the bathroom, and snores next to me in bed. I love the outdoors and so does she. She's getting older now and can't go quite as far, but man she's definitely still kicking. I got her when she was 2 years old, for my 13th birthday. I'm 22 now. I have managed to keep her with me except for about a 1.5 year period (1 year in the dorms, 3 months in Alaska after graduation, and 3 months where I'm at now in the Turks and Caicos).

I always feel really guilty about leaving her and can't wait to see her again (on Monday!). I just landed a permanent job in Alaska and that means she gets to come with me. I can't wait. Alaska is the most magical place, especially for dogs. They just roam free and romp through the most beautiful areas. Plus Alaska is pretty cool (physically), and she has a lot of floof. She thrives in cold weather.

happy,My happiness comes and goes often as Ive battled depression for over 20 years. Today is so far this years highlight for me.,"Ive battled depression since I was a young teenager. I tend to try to elevate my own self worth and mood by trying to give back much more than I keep.

I run my own small business and do a lot to try and keep my staff content while at work. I try to take all the things I resented about my former employers and do the opposite.

In  the end that means I pay myself much less than I should with the hopes that my generosity in other areas comes back in good karma and continues business growth. 

So today was odd as in its a slower time of year for us so my stress levels elevate quite often. Had an opportunity to [buy a large quantity of energy drinks](https://imgur.com/a/d4T1VO1) for the shop as I try to supply these as often as I can. Hoping it lasts atleast 4-6 months.

happy,"After seeing too much of r/entitledparents, I want to talk about my Mom","I've been addicted to those Reddit readings on Youtube, and I've heard just way too many stories about terrible parents. Several of which were about narcissistic mothers ruining their children's' lives. And it just made me appreciate my mother even more, and decided if there's a place on the internet to talk about how horrible your mother is, there should be a place for the good ones.

I still live with my mom at 24, which according to stereotype would mean that I am some burden on her with no job not going anywhere in life. On the contrary, I have a job, my boyfriend lives with us (she sees him like the son she never had), and she loves having me here. My boyfriend and I are working to move out, but until then, it's like heaven living with my mom. She also doesn't charge me rent, because my student loans are more expensive than rent would even be. I tell her I love and appreciate her every day, and am so grateful for everything she's done for me and still does for me.

She is the nicest person on the face of the earth, she has no enemies. I swear she gets angry once a year. When she does get mad, duck and cover, but it's always justified. I can't recall a time she has ever screamed and me or my sister, and she's never laid hands on us. When we were little children, if we ever started making a scene and screaming and crying in a public place, what did she do? Did she just let us be little hellians and ruin the day of everyone else? No. No matter what she was doing, she would pick us up and carry us out of the establishment till we calmed down. And it worked.

Too many parents give kids something they want when they're being a brat to make them behave. That only makes them think that being a brat will get them what they want! My mother's tactic was ""if you guys behave throughout this whole grocery trip, I'll buy you some candy at the check out."" And again, it worked.

My sister and I both have different mental disorders, personally I have depression and Aspergers, so things were harder when we were teenagers and our developing brains were battling trying to grow with the disorders. When things got too intense and we had arguments, my mother sat the entire family down in the living room and she played mediator for all of us to talk everything out like a little family therapy session. She read books on familial conflict and handled everything so calmly, it always worked out. I still have a good relationship with my sister.

I feel sad for people that feel like they can't talk about certain things with their parents. Surely that was me for many years as I was doing things I shouldn't have been, but nowadays nothing is off limits. Weed was legalized recently in my state and we had an edible together. TMI warning but several years ago she legit bought me a sex toy for Christmas. Wrapped it and everything. Sex, drugs, secrets, nothing is kept from my mother and she never judges me for anything.

More great things about her, she's a painter, she quilts, she crochets, she embroiders, she makes origami, she can do any craft work she sets herself to. Our house is filled with her artwork on large canvases. She accepts everyone regardless of race, gender, sexuality, etc., I think something very beneficial is that my best childhood friend is trans and she learned about trans people through my friendship with him.

And all of this amazing stuff? This is in spite of the HORRIBLE things that happened to her as a child, and throughout her life. I remember working with a mother and daughter once, they would not stop swearing at each other and just saying the most horrible things, and that was their form of ""love."" It came up in conversation how difficult of a life the mother had and how that was some kind of excuse.

My mother is an example of how no matter how bad your past was, it's no excuse to be a terrible person. My mom was abused by her father when she was a child in every way you can abuse someone. She loved and married two men, and both of them died (rest in peace dad). She survived cancer, hernias, a burst appendix, her stomach is a huge map of scars, and she still comes home from work after an hour commute every day with a huge smile on her face.

I'm convinced my mom is superwoman. I just wanted to come here today to share with everyone how amazing my mother is.

happy,I dont have a photo to post but I found something tonight from 18 years ago that made me so happy.,"18 years ago I was 13 years old and every year my family and I went to a beach in Florida for three weeks. I remember not wanting to go because every time I did I kinda felt like I was being dragged along to do things I didnt want to do. 

This summer however, as we were checking into the hotel I made eye contact with a 14 year old girl who was also with her family. Being 13 I thought I was in love lol. Turns out her family was staying in the same hotel for three weeks as well and they were in a room on our hallway. As she was walking away with her family she turned back and kinda smiled at me. 

That night my parents wanted to go get some food but allowed me to stay at the hotel alone. I watches TV for a bit and then decided to try and find a vending machine. As luck would have it I ran into the girl from the lobby in the hallway. We kinda chit chatted and talked for a bit. She told me her name was Marissa. I remember she had jet black hair and green eyes. She told me that her family was from Italy originally but that they had lived in the states for the last few years. 

Her mom came out of the room and saw us talking. She was really sweet and told me that our families should get together sometime. After I said bye to them I went back to my room daydreaming about this black haired girl. When my parents came back I told them about her and her family and my mom said if we saw them around we could all go say hey. 

The next morning I saw them at breakfast downstairs and my family and I went over and said good morning. My dad and her dad hit it off and my mom made the suggestion that they should have a guys day one day and that her and the girls mom could have a girls day. 

We all ended up making plans to go to the beach together. Every day I got to hang out with marissa. We talked and laughed and explores the beach. She told me about her friends and i told her about mine. 

Fast forward to the last day of our trip. I was feeling really sad because i knew I'd have to say goodbye to marissa. At this point, being the 13 year old boy i was, i was convinced i was in love with her. Our families became friends and we met downstairs to say bye and part ways. 

As I was saying bye to Marissa she gave me a seashell that was in the shape of a heart. She told me that she didnt want to leave and that one day our paths would cross again. She then gave me my first real kiss on the lips. Right in front of our families. 

She was my first summer love and I thought about her often. Years have gone bye and I can barely remember that trip other than little flashes of memories. Months go by and I never think about it at all. 

Tonight I was going through some stuff my mom gave me from the storage unit. I found a box that I kept when I was a kid. The only thing in it was the heart shaped seashell. 

I have no idea where you are now Marissa but I hope your life is amazing and wonderful. Seeing this shell made all those memories of that beach vacation come rushing back to me. I feel like I can still smell the ocean on the shell. I sat in the floor for a bit and drifted off, back to those nights on the beach and reminiscing about my first love. The black haired girl Marissa. ",SomeoneStopMePlease,self.happy,1552290862
happy,talking to her was literally one of the best decisions i've ever made,"so about 3 or 4 months ago i was noticing there was this crazy pretty girl in my class, but for the longest time, i was way too scared to approach her just because it was much easier to just sit back and keep the secret to myself. well, a couple months past by and i knew i couldn't do it forever. so i worked my ass off in order to become her friend. even if she thought i was the ugliest person to ever roam the earth, at least i would be able to talk to her, right? so, with my hands shaking so hard they were about to fall off my wrists, i sent her our first snapchat. it was about this show she's really into, and i figured it could be something that would not only allow me to know her better but it'd let her know that i really did care about her. well, a couple of weeks pass over and i was talking to one of my good friends named dean. dean is a real jokester; he doesn't take too many things very seriously, but he was looking out for me and i am forever grateful for that. he helped me find a way to get to talking with her, and ever since then, things have been so great. not a day passes by where i don't think about her, and in these short 10 days she has very quickly become one of the nicest and most amazing people that i've ever met in my entire life. she's everything i could've asked for and so much more. i'm not quite sure if she knows how much i really like her, but if she ever does see this well then danna i want you to know that i absolutely fucking love you. you're one of the nicest people that i've ever met, and on top of that you're unbelievably pretty. i say it from time to time but i when i say that you are 5x or 100x prettier than another girl i 100% mean it. all in all there's just nothing about you not to love. you've literally got it all. just being able to talk to you is such a privilege i swear. i could talk about how amazing this girl is for hours and never get tired of it, but i know you don't have all day to read this. i just want you all to wish me luck for my future plans with her. i would be devastated if i fucked things up between us.",loganroger17,self.happy,1552287931

I joined the Air Force after High School, since I had nothing else going for me and it gave me a purpose for awhile. It was useful but not what I wanted to do.

After leaving the Military, School was still a source of Anxiety for me. It was something I failed at and didn't think I could ever bring myself to try again for it. Thoughts like, ""You didn't get in before why should you get in now?"" kept popping up. They kept my sight down at my feet instead of what I could be.

Thanks to some amazing people in my life giving me an enormous amount of support I was ready to try again and I found out today that I'll be going back to school this year.

I'll be 28 next week. It took ten years but I'm finally on the precipice of moving on and it just makes me so happy.

happy,Do you live the moment (here and now)? Some examples of how do I do it,"I'm often hearing words like - don't think about future or past too much. Live here and now. It's easy to say but how to implement it? Recently I started to understand part of it. And here are some examples of how do I implement that approach.

&amp;#x200B;

Today in the morning we with my wife were in the kitchen doing something. I was preparing breakfast and thinking about this episode, while my wife cut the orange peel to make orange zest as the ingredient for some sweets. I asked her “Do you think you can be happy at this moment? And if so, how you can explain the motives?”. And her answer was: “I’m glad that you are doing breakfast for me right now, and also I’m glad that our two-years-old boy still sleeping and we can enjoy the quiet moment, and also there is very beautiful morning sunlight outside and while I’m cutting the orange peel, I’m enjoying the process of creating ideal pieces of it.” That was her answer that contained a lot of different things. It was statical, visual and audial elements of a single moment which she enjoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

The second example is about breakfast itself. We’ve found the ideal formula of breakfast for ourselves and in most cases, we are using the same receipt and it’s really tasty. I’m sure you have your own picture of a tasty breakfast. So, imagine the situation. I’m doing my best to prepare the breakfast, using ideal ingredients, that I’ve bought specifically for it, serving that breakfast for me and my wife, we give ourselves a time to enjoy our meal and then I have two options. One option is to enjoy how it tastes, what is the texture and flavors, to chew every single bite and get most of it. Because everything is set. The breakfast is ideal, I have time for it, and moreover, eating slowly is healthier. Or I can switch myself to automatic mode to chew with no sense and at the same time to think about different things from the past or near future. That means that I’m wasting my efforts to make that breakfast ideal without realizing how tasty it is.

happy,You Are The Happiness You Seek - A Meditation Poem by Sri-Tjay -,"Why doesn't happiness last? Does lasting happiness exist? How do we find it? This poem explains how meditation restores the happiness we are seeking.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**   
Happiness is not a topic for most people because they are too busy seeking it every day.

People seek happiness outside themselves even though they realize it never lasts.

They do this because they are unaware that meditation restores our inner happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

**You Are The Happiness You Seek**

Happiness is a deep contentment,

with things just as they are,

having little desire to gain more,

you shine like a brightly lit star.

&amp;#x200B;

As needless thoughts diminish,

and emotions they carry too,

meditation fulfilling it's promise,

understanding happiness is you.

&amp;#x200B;

Happiness is in your being,

seeking nothing more,

in meditation realizing this,

happiness comes to the fore. 

&amp;#x200B;

**INSIGHTS INTO THE POEM""S MEANING**

&amp;#x200B;

**Happiness is a deep contentment,**  
Inner happiness is an inborn state of joyful well-being and contentment with life as it is now. It is not about becoming happy, it is about being happy.

**with things just as they are,**  
What are things, anyway? Things are not just material possessions. Things are the thoughts we have about ourselves and the conditions surrounding us. 

**having little desire to gain more,**  
What is desire? Is it not a craving for happiness? When meditation restores inner happiness, desire for happiness based on things outside ourselves diminishes. 

**you shine like a brightly lit star.**  
As mediators restore their inner happiness they radiate an aura of deep contentment with their life. Others feel their inner joy as a pleasant intangible vibe.  

&amp;#x200B;

**As needless thoughts diminish,**  
The secret to restoring our inner happiness is meditation. Why? Because meditation diminishes thoughts that push us to seek happiness outside ourselves in things. 

**and emotions they carry too,**  
When desiring thoughts of happiness diminish so do the emotions connected to them. Psychology states that thoughts and emotions cannot be separated.

**meditation fulfilling its promise,**  
Meditation has restored inner happiness and serenity to humanity for millennia. All we need to do, is to let go of thoughts long enough for them to let go of us.

**understanding happiness is you.**  
We don't have to struggle to restore our inner happiness. It happens automatically when we meditate. Why? Because the obstacles that prevent it are diminished.

&amp;#x200B;

**Happiness is in your being,**  
This statement is literally true. As babies, we are happy and content with the world as it is. It is only when our brain begins to think, do we forget it and seek it.

**seeking nothing more,**  
As meditation restores our inner happiness by diminishing the needless thoughts that prevent it, we lose the desire for seeking happiness outside of ourselves.

**in meditation realizing this,**  
Witnessing the restoration of our own inner happiness is one of the most important awakenings a meditator experiences.  

**happiness comes to the fore.**  
The inner happiness that has been hidden from our view by needless desiring thoughts now transforms our reality and our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

happy,I had a great dream about sisterhood and solidarity among women.,"Hi everyone.
I’ve just woken up smiling because I had a dream I need to share. I don’t really know if this is the right place to share this type of story but it makes me happy so I guess it is.
The story starts quite bad but it’s the best ending. 

Two pieces of context: 1) I’ve just moved in a new city where I don’t know anyone, and I sometimes go to meet-ups in bars or other places alone, to meet people. 2)Yesterday I went to an amazing march in Barcelona for the International Women Day. This may have conditioned my dream.

Now we can start with the story of my dream:

Everything starts at the entrance of a bar/kind of small nightclub. I’m alone, don’t know anyone. I enter the bar, look for a spot where I could go. It’s quite early so the place is not crowded, but there are a few people drinking and dancing. I check the different parts of the bar and have mixed feelings about the place. I then decide to go to the toilets before going to order a drink.
The toilets are at the entrance of the bar. As I enter the toilets, a man follows me and prevents me from closing the door. He grabs my arm. I feel threatened. He starts speaking:
Man: Hi girl, can I come in with you?
Me: Of course not, please leave my arm
Man: Come on you obviously want people to do things to you
Me (very scared): I don’t, please leave me
Man: Stop it, you’re coming here alone, you’re so pretty, you’re wearing a nice shirt that let us see the shape of your boobs, and no you go alone to the toilets?! This is so sexual come on.
At that point he keeps getting closer, i fell scared, lost, and I almost can’t move. But I decide to keep things under control, and start laughing as hard as I can. He looks weird. I see a group of girls going by and scream to them, still laughing : “Girls! This guy thinks me going to the toilet was a invitation for him”.
They come by and start laughing at the guy, making him feel ridiculous. Some of the girls go call other girls, and soon a small crowd of women is around the entrance and in the bathroom, moving the guy to hug me, making so much fun of him, laughing a lot and being sisters. 

This may sound stupid as this is just a dream I had last night, and as the starting situation was so bad, but it really makes me happy to share it. If every sad agression story could have such an ending. 
Thank you so much to those who took the time to read this ❤️

My 6year relationship ended, 3 of my friends died, 5 of my family members died, my mom got scleroderma which has since spread to her lungs and digestive track, I got too busy with school and work to maintain my sports, and I got into a year long relationship with a horrifically manipulative older man.

I finally got a new place. It’s a little expensive for my grad school budget, but it feels like home and makes me happy. I reconnected with girl friends I lost touch with when I was in my isolating relationship, and they genuinely seem to want to have me around.

I also started seeing a guy. He’s kind and didn’t mind waiting for me to be ready to have sex. Last week, I had a low moment where I got bad work news and wanted to leave the guys place. I feel like most people in my life don’t care to hear about my problems, so I never open up. This guy gave me a hug and told me that he wants me to stay and talk to him about what’s wrong, but I can leave if I’d like and we could talk later. It was so genuine and soft. No demands, no annoyance, no preaching solutions, just a light offer to listen. 

Yesterday, I cooked him dinner and we got really drunk together and finally became physical. It was one of the best intimate experience I’ve ever had, but I woke up with a horrific hangover. He held my hair while I was sick, brought me paper towels and water, cooked me breakfast and made me coffee before I had to leave for work. I’m busy studying right now, and he is picking me up some Chipotle and bringing it over for a dinner study break date.

My ex would always do these big grand and expensive gestures, and would use those as excuses when he would cheat or lie to me. This guy is so light and casual with his actions, but they are so thoughtful and so meaningful.

I’m sure we’ll run into conflicts, and maybe we won’t last, but right now, having someone do something like bring me a burrito while I’m studying has made me feel so cared for and happy. I don’t even think he realized what the gesture means to me. To him it’s just a casual thing he’s offering. Somehow that makes it even better ",fefifofumm,self.happy,1553392735

happy,Today I'm happy because I self cared: I finally got around to using my bathtub after a lifetime and a tough week at work,"I went for a biking try out for the first time yesterday and because it is a strenuous sport, my body went all sore today. Last night I came home and just passed out. Today I woke up around 10am on a Saturday, went out to get a nice warm coffee, read my book, and made my to do list for the day. In my list I unconsciously put in an hour for shower, even though my showers are pretty short and max 15 mins. Anyway I didnt dwell on it, and then came back home. I had already turned the heat on, so the water was all nicely heated when I went in. As I was going I turned off the lights, something unplanned and something I never do.

I then turned on the hot shower and my body started releasing the ache. I just sat down under the water and let it hit me. Without having anything planned, I reached towards the bathtub stopper and put it on the drain. I have remnants of being a minimalist in my heart, and I dont like wasting water, hence I never ever thought of using the stopper before. But this time, I just let the tub fill in with hot water while I laid down and nursed my body ache. I shampooed and elaborately massaged my hair off the desert sand that got in due to the dirt biking activity the other day. I then just laid down for half an hour and didnt try to think anything except feel my body float shallowly. When I came out after probably 45 mins, I felt myself so refreshed, and the body ache subsided.

After a whole week of a grinding week at work, lingering job insecurity, PMSing and being ghosted by a guy I thought could be a potential partner, I really needed this. I have an interview this week, and I really need it. I'm asking you all to keep me in your well wishes and prayers. Thank you for reading xx",zeerak91,self.happy,1553371530

For 22 years, I've battled, nearly to the death, with depression. I've had low self worth and trust issues. Recently, a friend of mine caught me off guard one night by telling me I was invaluable in his life, and for the first time in my life, I felt like I mattered. I felt like I finally had a reason to live. This inspired me to tell one of my other friends how important she is to me, and she feels the same. With a new outlook on life, I let myself care about other her, and other people I pushed away. We talked and it turns out we both really like eachother. Unfortunately she lives in another country, so we decided that we should meet before we make it official. She makes me smile when I think of her, and for the first time, I'm not afraid to feel how she makes me feel. For the first time, I have plans for the future, and I'm not afraid to face it. I just feel okay, now, and it's weird as hell.

happy,A Nice Tribute To My Grandmother (long read),"I am here to share something that my sister and I created. I will start out with a brief backstory.

Please understand that this is not to be taken as a sad story at any point, as you will see if you read on. 
Everything worked out as well as possible and my Grandmother was prepared to move on to the next step of her journey. 🙂

So a little about my Grandmother.

My grandmother, on my fathers side, had always been known for her traditional Pennsylvania Dutch cooking and absolutely amazing recipes.

She had fallen ill a few months ago and moved up to a local nursing home; which she had worked at for over 20 years.

Our immediate family and many of her friends made sure we visited her very often.

On the 25th of April, my Grandfather, my Father, my Sister and myself were up for a visit. My grandmother was very tired but she was able to briefly say hello to us. In the late afternoon hours she told my Grandfather she was ready to go.
Later that day, in the early evening, we saw the signs that she was she preparing to pass. We were all there for her, and we were with her supporting her.

My grandfather went to her bed, sat next to her and held her hand as she left.

She had chosen not to have a traditional service and to simply be cremated, but shall be honored tomorrow by a small amount of family and friends.

So we decided to do something a little different to show our respects and further preserve her legacy.
Instead of handing out a memorial paper we made a tribute to her in the form of a cookbook, featuring some of her most popular recipes.

To do this, I borrowed her large collection of recipes from my Grandfather.
I then made high resolution scans of the family favorites and uploaded them to my Sister’s Dropbox account.

I also scanned several photos of my Grandmother (and some with her and my Grandfather) throughout the years and sent them to my Sister to edit as well.

My Sister then edited the notecard scans to be printed into a small cookbook and used a photo of the wallpaper from my Grandmother’s kitchen as the background for the pages.

My Sister placed a dedication message and arranged the recipes by types (main courses, soups, desserts, genera knowledge).

So we’ve finished scanning and editing right? But now where to have it printed and bound properly...

My Sister found a store to do exactly that!

I will not name the exact store because they did something _very_ nice for us, and just incase; I don’t want to get any employees in trouble for being good people.

When she brought the prepared files to the store and explained the plans, we were given a price quote and estimated time for completion.

As it came time to finalize the print; we were u fortunately told that the quote would be roughly double the cost. We decided we would simply make a tiny number of copies and give them to just a few immediate family members.

However: the employees were very much moved by our project and took matters into their own hands. 😃 

The prints originally had a blank white border due to the printer not being able to fully cover the pages. An employee hand-cut the border off! She also took it upon herself to offer a *massive* discount and provided 3 free extras, which absolutely made sure that everyone who is intended to have a copy will be able to do so.

Thanks for reading! I hope to inspire others to do something like this, our family who knows of this project is nothing short of thrilled and I know that tomorrow this will help make a lot of people happy. 

If you have similar stories please share!
I’ll make sure to check back on here incase anyone reads this.

Bummer. Look around for a change machine, but there isn't one. Oh well. So I loaded up one washer with as much of our stanky clothing as I could, then ran back to my RV--I'd forgotten my detergent.

When I got back, ALL the quarter slots on all the open machines had been filled! A guy was walking out as I was entering, it must've been him, and I ran back out to thank him but he'd already driven away. It seriously made my day with such a seemingly small act of kindness that really meant a lot to me.

happy,Make someone happy. Thank your best of friends!,"This is a post for anyone who has or had a special someone who lives far away! Friend, lover, or otherwise. BEWARE, IT'S A HUGE Post! 90% gratitude.

MMORPGs were all the rage when I was younger. Play immersive video games with people all around the world? That sure sounds cool for a kid who barely even left his home town. 

Making friends online is finicky. People are hard to predict through a chat bubble, and everyone is going through their own hardships in the background. When you find a group of people who play at your side from so far away, even someone as socially reclusive as me could experience being accepted for who I am, and not who I appear to be.

This is an appreciation post for not just all those people, but one in particular. People who are familiar with the social life of an MMO player are aware of how quick someone is to try dating online, no matter where the other person lives. We dated, and it was fun, and we got along, and we played together constantly. She lives in Canada and I the US, and that may not sound far comparatively, but it's a world away for a kid. Time passed, and we drifted apart. Life went on, and we had to prioritize more local matters.

Today I know very few of those people that I played with back then, but she and I still chat frequently. Whether it's through emails, texts, social media, video games, or phone calls, we've always found our way to communicate. It has been 10 years now. We are not dating, but good friends who keep in contact.

Long distance relationships are hard, but not impossible, especially for a friendship. Through the ten years we knew each other, there would be months of silence, but I knew she was always within reach. The topics we talk about are different now. We used to talk about love, the future, our families, and what kind of build we want for our next character. Now we talk about work, our mental troubles, and nostalgia. I cherish them both equally.

I am intensely thankful for her. Everyone needs someone to talk to, when they're at their lowest, and at their highest. If you know someone like this, I've noticed something in particular that has come up in recent conversation that others may understand: in these ten years, we have not once been within arms reach, and at this point she is unsure why I adore her so, and does not know if I truly know who she is now that she has grown and changed.

My life is better because she existed within it. I want people to understand that their existence alone is reason enough for anyone to love anything about them. She exists, she spoke to me through ten years of awkward growth and my own struggles. That is the kind of person she is; one who sticks by no matter the insanity. No matter how her personality changes over time, she has proven herself to be accepting and enduring. I want her to know that she is appreciated, and always will be, no matter where life takes us, even if we lose contact one day. I will continue to tell her this constantly, as I have been, but I want others to do the same. 

Life changes. People alter, but the deeds they left behind are also altering those around them. I am who I am today because of her. She is appreciated for existing. I am glad that she lived. I am glad that she is alive. I'm glad that she chose to remain my friend, no matter what.

If you know anyone who has made a positive impact on your life, make sure they know that they will be loved forever, whether directly or in memory. Do not allow that person to lose their confidence, because in cases such as mine, she's the reason why I have confidence myself.

Appreciate your truest friends, no matter how far they may be. Thank you, my friends. Thank you, the one who is still here. I cherish you all.",Sir_Loinstache,self.happy,1557511767

happy,I am blessed with the family I have...,"I've been having pretty severe health issues for 5 years now. Recent health developments over this last year has left everyone stumped on what's going on with me. I've been down this road before, so I'm patient with discovering what's wrong then fixing it. But I've been getting disgruntled lately. Just super depressed and frustrated that this keeps happening to me and it takes doctors months, sometimes years to figure it out and assist me. 

So, being this happening AGAIN, it feels like I'm just getting kicked down with one thing after the next and its put my life and future plans on hold. Just tired of it and losing hope and thinking it must be in my head, but I know what I'm feeling isnt normal. I just feel like giving up. But my mom, dad, sister, sometimes brother, always are trying to help motivate me to go to doctors, try new vitamins, even cbd (which has been helping actually and surprised me). 

I just feel so loved and cared for and I've never felt that before... actually noticing the care and want for me to succeed in life and just to be happy and feel good is a staggering feeling and I have so much gratefulness towards my family for just caring SO MUCH for me. I feel very blessed. I think my mom might of found the answer as well and it might be a simple answer to what's happening, so my fingers are crossed. Just trying to have and think good vibes. Full of love.

happy,I fucking love my job.,"So, the county in which I have lived for all but one year of my life has an amazing library system. I've been going there for literally longer than I can remember; my grandparents took me there as an infant. I basically lived there in college.

Just over a year ago, I was hired at this library in a part-time, entry-level position. It was awesome, and extremely rewarding, and *fun*, and I made a bunch of friends. But, by itself, it couldn't pay the bills. So, I also worked a stressful 30-hour-per-week job at a bookstore. I was working seven days a week, averaging 46 hours a week, and because I was part-time at both jobs, I had no health insurance, no vision, no dental, had no vacation or sick-leave, etc.

A few months ago I was promoted to a full-time position at the library and was able to quit my bookstore job. This is what I had wanted for a long time, because I knew it would make me happier, but it has been even better than I had expected.

I'm getting paid more in total, despite working fewer hours. I have full benefits (great ones, at that). I have an easier schedule (no more closing at one job only to have to open the next day at the other job). It's less driving, too.

I switched branches, so I'm working with new people, but they're amazing and welcoming and supportive.

But the best thing is that I feel like I'm giving back to my community in a way that I had never felt, and could probably never feel, in a retail job.

Technically I work for the county, and this county includes the town where I was born, the town where I lived from ages 3 to 21, and the town where I have lived for the last 6 years. The people who come in to my library are literally my neighbors, friends, and family. My aunt and uncle come in. I take my own nieces to story-time.

I may be, in general, a pretty cynical, pessimistic person. But goddamn it I love my job.",EgonGaming,self.happy,1557452265

happy,"I was defended by my boyfriend's mother, when his aunt tried to insult me."," 

This happened a few months ago, but still makes me smile when I think about it.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years now. His family (mom , dad and older sister ) is absolutely wonderful people. They're very accepting and living. We revealed to them when we got serious that we *do not* want children. His parents just smiled and told us we were both adults and it was our decision. They were true to their word. Not once have they pressured us to marry or have kids. His mother went as far as to that she commends us for knowing ourselves and knowing what we want. In our country , India, this is a rarity.

It's his extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins etc) who have asked us , rather condescendingly, if we plan to marry. His uncle once told me I better hurry up and give him children before it's too late. (I'm 35).

Anyway, one evening, we were at their (bf's parents') place for dinner with the entire family. Bf's aunt started grilling me about marriage and kids when he was off answering a phone call. She doesn't dare to say anything in front of him as he has told her to back off in the past. I just tell her casually that neither I nor he want children. She looked horrified and glanced at my bf's mom, as if expecting her to say something. She didn't. She simply enjoyed her desert. Aunt then asked her how on earth was she not outraged that the woman her son loves will not give him a family.

Bf's mom's reply : ""It's their life and their decision. They're both adults and can live however they want.""

Aunt : (almost sputtering) But but don't you and your husband want grandchildren? How could you let him date her.

Bf's mom : I don't *let* my son do anything. As I said he's an adult. We don't own our children and they don't have to do things just to make us happy. Also, please don't talk to shygirlturnedsassy like that ever again. She's not just my son's lover, she's also my friend and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable in my home.""

The way she said all this while maintaining her regal demeanor made me want to hug her. I was especially touched because my own step mom and aunts have said some pretty awful things about my decision to remain childfree and they would never stand up for me the way my boyfriend's mother did.

Bf's aunt was very quiet for the rest of the evening.",shygirlturnedsassy,self.happy,1557403971

We had a wonderful relationship that truly felt fulfilling and meaningful, and I had always intended to marry her.  It was an extremely difficult time for me, as everything had felt right up until we reached that impasse.  It was very difficult for me to let go of the dream of having a family with her.

Well, last week she contacted me for the first time since we split 5 months ago.  She told me that she's done a lot of thinking and examined her priorities, and she's come around to the idea of having a kid with me.  I listened to her reasons and how she changed her mind (she had been adamantly child free) and, what can I say, I believe her.

So now we're starting to plan our life together again, and it feels wonderful.  Like a second chance at a dream you never thought was possible, even though you were so sure it had to happen.  It's crazy how much my life has been turned upside down in the past few days.

I was in an abusive relationship, had toxic friends, and was in one of the worst stages of my life. My high school teachers gave up on me and didn't think I would amount to much of anything.
-5 years ago, I decided to become an LPN because I loved nursing. My grades were average, but the instructors were cruel. On the day before I graduated, one of the instructors told me ""I'm letting you graduate, but I honestly don't think you have what it takes to be a nurse."" because I was shy and nervous when it came to nursing (I was scared, trying to rebuild my life). She crushed me. But I kept going.
-3 years ago, I wanted to apply for the RN program at my local college. ""Friends"" told me to not even try because it was ""too competitive"", ""you have to be REALLY smart"", and it's ""not worth being in debt for the rest of your life"". I did it anyway.
-Today, I graduate as an RN student with academic honors, a member of the Nursing Honor Society, and a GPA of 3.4.

happy,Made a lot of life-changing (and probably life-saving) decisions this year.,"After a series of impossibly disastrous years, I decided tgis year to take control of the things I could control. At the age of 49, I've made unexpected progress mentally, spiritually, and especially physically. At the beginning of March, I was 228 lbs with a BP of 159/120 and headed for pre-diabetes. After a few months of a combination of intermittent fasting, one meal a day, sunrise fasts, cutting out most sugar, all fake sugar,and all caffeine, I am back in a normal and safe zone.

Happy.

I really hate asking for help and am super introverted and independent. Every year, when I'd move into college I just wanted to be dropped off and do all the actual move in by myself. I wouldn't even want my parents to step foot inside for any least a week until I'd finished decorating. My mom would always be super sad to leave. This weekend, I moved across the country to start a new job, and I invited my mom to come hang out for a few days so we could explore the new city together. The plan was to just drop off my things in my new apartment (I was doing a lease takeover) and then we'd just goof off and I'd get settled in later.

We got to my apartment, and the previous tenant left it absolutely TRASHED. It was basically unlivable. I could not believe the landlord let them get away with this. I was just absolutely mortified. My mom calmed me down and we went together to buy cleaning supplies and she helped me get the place looking nice again. I kept apologizing and felt terrible that I invited her on a vacation with me only to make her clean up after other people, and she never got mad. She just got really happy and said ""you're finally letting me be your mom, that's all I wanted to be when you were in college"". I felt so loved.",regan-omics,self.happy,1558464269

The only sport I really want to watch is International Rugby. I've tried some of the online streaming things when my country has been playing but the quality is usually very poor and the connection breaks and so on. Not a pleasant experience.

Anyway recently I stumped up and paid for the games my country was playing but money is always tight. 

I've been dreading even finding out about The Rugby World Cup coverage because of the cost. I want to watch all the games if I can.

Took a deep breath and searched it up just now — it's on terrestrial TV (and their free streaming players)!!

I am absolutely stoked and since my family isn't too bothered about rugby one way or the other I just had to tell someone.

I know it's silly but, if you've managed to read this far, thanks. A lot! :D",RodneyRodnesson,self.happy,1558460100

happy,"I went to visit my dad at work, thinking he would just be happy to see me. But I soon realized that such a small gesture could mean so much. He was waiting at the bus stop for me when I arrived, and couldn't wait to show me around. He stayed an extra hour at work so he could spend an hour with me.","It meant so much to me to see how excited he was. It may seem insignificant, but we've had a stressful few years due to house break ins and my dad working in a highly stressful job in the country we lived in before. He also was not working in a safe environment or area and it took a toll on all of us.

We have just all moved to a new country. I'm an adult now, but I moved too to be closer to my family. However, I haven't been home for a few months due to work.  My dad finally found a new job position, after months of searching, and this is his new 'thing'. I thought just popping in would make him happy. 

But it made my day to realize how a small gesture meant so much. He stayed an hour overtime just so that I could come visit and he could spend time with me during a highly demanding and busy day. And his excitement to show me everything he was doing was so clear. He took me around the whole building and introduced me to everyone.

We have our issues of course with common things and disagreement or hangry arguments but 90 percent of the time we are so freaking happy.

I usually go out there for a couple minutes and just entertain not that I have to but because I want to. I hope everyone can find a relationship like this. Just be yourself most of the time the other person is probably going to be just as goofy and if not then it’s not. 

Thanks for reading even though it’s not much of a info post!

happy,These sweet wholesome Ivorian people at my job don't know how much it means,"There are these wholesome Ivorian 🇨🇮 people at my job, and when I work their shift, they greet me with ""Monsieur [Grimlock](https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/transformers-age-of-extinction-dinobot.jpg)/[Alcatraz](https://i.redd.it/dblqh02cc8q31.png) is here!""

What happened was when they came, I was tasked with training them, and got to know them more over breaks. I showed me interests, Jurassic Park and Transformers. They were amazed. They had never seen someone be so passionate. So then they would call me ""Monsieur Dinosaur"" or ""Monsieur Robot"" so then I told them [there was something that was both](https://youtu.be/smdTluj_94M). However, I decided to take it 1 step further by showing them [one particular video](https://youtu.be/Oqrp93YGNg8). And then they were really blown away! After that, they called me ""Monsieur Alcatraz."" (Alcatraz is the name of the playable protagonist of Crysis 2)

Whenever they want help they call to me ""You are supposed to be Alcatraz! You strong!""

Over the summer, when I stayed longer hours, they would say ""Grimlock is staying extra hours because he needs money to be Alcatraz""(Although they are immigrants, they have a general idea who Iron Man is)

All that in a French-African accent.

The thing is, they think it is a running joke. But they don't know how much it means... I had unintentionally convinced them that I am a Bruce Wayne type person bad ass... But I'm not... they don't know it melts my heart that they think I'm cool...

And just like Batman and Alcatraz don't settle when the going gets tough, their sweet voices remind to me push my self to be my highest self.",saurogon,self.happy,1571454700

happy,Going to the doctor changed my life so fast!!!,"A little backstory, I went to the doctor for the first time since childhood about a week ago due to chest pains. My primary care doctor ended up being the most empathetic, understanding and validating person I have met in a long time. I felt like she was genuinely happy I went to the doctor and was taking all of my concerns to heart and making sure I felt welcome to be there. While I did end up with bad news about my heart, she told me she was going to get me to a cardiologist ASAP and set up a follow up appointment for a little over a week later. Guys, I can not fathom myself ever saying I’m excited to go to a doctor but I am!! I really am! And on top of that, I ended up telling her about how a private psychiatrist in the area turned me away because she felt she wasn’t ethically capable of handling the problems I had, only to refer me to a group therapy that had a 6 month waiting list. I was crushed, because it took everything in me to finally get up and schedule an appointment in the first place. Well, my new doctor must have really taken what I said to heart because today I got a call from a counselor in the same building as my doctor saying I had a referral from her and he would like to get me in for an appointment ASAP. Not only that, but I’ll be in by the end of the month and this is the first time I’ve made an appointment my myself. Ever. My boyfriend usually handles all of the appointment making because for a long time I felt like I was incapable and it was a mental barrier that distanced me from the fear of calling and the fear of being rejected. I used to be a chronic rescheduler, extending visits by months at a time. But I honestly can not wait to go to my two appointments coming up this month.

She's a great kid, and I just wanted her to know that there are people out there that actually care. I talked to her one morning when she reeked of cigarettes and told her she should throw on some ""smell good"" if she had it. Found out how long she's been smoking and what's going on at home. I didn't pressure her, but told her gently that if she keeps smoking, it will be so much harder when she tries to quit. I smoke a bit, but I could tell that she's in a spot where a smoke offered that little relief from an otherwise stressful day.

I started at a family business 2 years ago as a shop laborer and today I got promoted to assistant treasurer. I've been working my ass off at this company and am actually being recognized for everything I contribute. 

My boss called me in first thing this morning to tell me I got the job, I'm still almost in shock sitting at my desk thinking of where I was 2 years ago. This is the 4th raise I've gotten at this company, I'm making 2.5 times as much as when I started here and now have full benefits. They pay 100% of my healthcare premium and it's actually good plan. I love the work environment, my coworkers, and my bosses.

I'm also moving into my very own place for the first time in my life. It's just a 750 sq ft house but that's all my dog and I need. It has over an acre of land and cuts my daily commute down by 30 minutes EACH WAY! 

Lastly, I've managed to pay off 8k of credit card debt leaving me with just a $200/mo car payment as my only debt.

happy,First relationship in seven years and it was the best decision to wait.,"I know this post fits in many other Reddit’s/subreddits, but here I am as well - happy!! 

I[F24] met someone [M30] online and it was the best 50 bucks I’ve invested in years.
I’ve never been big on online dating, knowing the horror stories and/or stereotypes of tinder and co. I’ve never been big in dating normally either. My first relationship I had at the age of 17 and it lasted a few months. It was cute but I was shy, anxious and not ready for a relationship at all so it never worked out. The following years I spent working on my a levels and college degree and now I’m about to graduate from university, never focused on guys. Sure, I had the occasional (obsessive) crush but I never pursued it, knowing it would only distract me. So a month + ago, I felt like dipping a toe into the modern dating world and I signed up for a subscription to a serious dating site. I hadn’t planned on meeting up with anyone but just like getting into the game. Learning how to flirt and small talk etc. and I would’ve been perfectly happy with just friendships coming of it. A few days passed and I matched with and got chatted up by this incredible guy that I had an instant connection with. Two weeks of texting and phone calls, and we met up. He always plans the most romantic dates, even if mostly casual. We’ve been talking to each other for six weeks now and decided on date three that we could pretty much make it official. Six weeks of contact, only four dates later, I feel like either one of us is on the verge of professing their love. It is so wonderful. Unfortunately we are currently having somewhat of a long distance relationship, only seeing each other one day a week at the weekend. Which is partly good bc that gives us time to take it somewhat slowly and get to know each other better. He treats me like his princess. Has met my parents on the first date (accidentally) but basically is already part of the family. 
The reason why this whole thing is so exciting and wonderful for me is bc I have never been able to let anyone touch me due to sexual abuse at an early age but with him, it’s mind blowing. We haven’t had sex yet but having him be able to touch me is exhilarating enough for what is yet to come (ha. Wordplay) 
I’m happy. I’m terrified of it, it’s so scary bc it feels like we’ve known each other our entire lives and it all goes so fast. But I’m happy and I know we can overcome every obstacle that I know is ahead. God, I’m happy and I needed to share it and thank you for reading!",InsecureGirlJKImDope,self.happy,1570453729

happy,One of my best friends felt proud of himself today.,"I started talking to a guy that had posted on r/toastme back in June. I came to learn he has a lot on his plate. He’s a double major, pre-med, works three jobs, is in a variety of campus activities, and has done an amazing job losing some weight in a healthy manner and building some major muscle. I also quickly realized that this man had NO self confidence. A crappy past and successful parent had convinced him that he’s not worth a dime. 

Today, I didn’t feel too great. I slept all day and didn’t talk to anyone very much. 

Him and I talk on a daily basis and he snapchatted me  today saying something along the lines of “Ugh you can’t be sick.” 

When I laughed and asked him why, he replied “Because I need someone to congratulate me for getting to bed early and also having studied tonight to the point of actually feeling super confident tomorrow and also having taught the people I was studying with and and and having something due tomorrow but instead of doing it tonight I’m doing it before class so I can get some sleep. AND even tho I ate bad for dinner,  I feel super fit today and can even admit I’m quite ripped.”

I cried for hours after writing it. I’ve been feeling like my best isn’t good enough and it’s difficult to see others succeed around me while I haven’t been getting the same results. I’ve resorted to smoking every night and getting high because it helps numb my emotions, and gives me something to look forward to. I received another midterm mark today and I got a B-!!

Knowing teenagers this can be a rare site. So he put the game on mute and just listened. I started to say something and he told me to shush. He hadn't heard that sound in a long time. I understood, but I don't think I really got it. Well, my youngest sister is currently living with me, and I think I got it. My mom kind of left her and hasn't come back. I was really worried about her, being in a new city, new school, living with me, my mom gone, just all new everything and feelings of abandonment. Well, last night I was in the kitchen cooking dinner and I hear her giggle. She was on speaker phone with a friend from school and they were just talking about randomness just laughing and giggling away. I didn't let her know I could hear her or anything. I just kinda stopped stirring the food for a second and just listened. Hearing her sound so happy melted my heart. I will never have my own kids and that's okay, it's not meant to be, but being able to enjoy these moments with her are amazing.

happy,"Three years ago, I could not imagine the life I would have right now.","My best friend at the time had gotten me kicked off my college campus by falsifying a claim that I had raped her (I’m a bisexual woman). Luckily, they were able to prove she was lying, but because she had family connections, I was asked to move off campus anyway. Our friends stopped talking to me and I graduated alone and friendless. 


I worked for a year, was in a fairly toxic (though luckily not abusive) relationship, when I got accepted to grad school in Cleveland, about nine hours from my home. I didn’t know it at the time, but that one email would change everything. 


It’s now a little over two years later. I woke up this morning in a house that I share with my best (girl) friend. We’ve been best friends for a year and I cannot imagine my life without her. I never want to go more than a day without talking to her. We’ve been through the worst of grad school together. She’s going to medical school and I’m so proud of her for it. She works her ass off and comes home exhausted and all
I can do is make sure the laundry and dishes are done so she doesn’t have to worry about it. She thanks me by cooking 3-4 times a week, usually my favorite Indian food (she’s Indian and an excellent chef). 


She introduced me to her childhood best friend, a loving, patient, funny, kind, intelligent man with whom I eventually fell in love. Our one year anniversary is in a few weeks. He lives in New Jersey and is finishing his first semester of law school. We’ve never gone more than four weeks without seeing each other. He worked with me gently through all the bullshit and bad habits of my past relationships, pushed me to work hard on myself, and introduced me to more wonderful people with whom I’m proud to be friends. My weekends (and occasionally weeks!) with him are spent having dinner with our (!) friends, going out on New York City, and cleaning his house together. His mom has my phone number and regularly texts me videos and news articles that she thinks I may find interesting. He is Indian and I am white, so we were concerned about how his family would react; they have been nothing but kind and welcoming and helpful from the beginning, helping me to learn the language and culture and including me in every way possible. They even FaceTimed me to include me in Diwali celebrations! 


My roommate’s boyfriend is here this weekend as well. Charming and intelligent, he’s an excellent chess player and a world class skier. He’s got a bit of a “brooding writer” vibe — incurable insomniac, with some of the greatest and most fascinating stories I’ve ever heard. 


My greatest joy in life is spending an evening at home with a bottle of wine and our little family of four, playing board games and watching movies and enjoying the company of my favorite people. 


To those of you feeling alone in the world: it gets better. It gets so much better. I had no one. Now I have my people, I have my home. Yours is out there too. You’ll find it soon.",tsisdead,self.happy,1572876185
happy,Partner's sorting out his relationship with alcohol,"He's not going totally sober, and I don't think he needs to. He's quitting drinking for a full month, hoping to slowly build a healthy relationship with alcohol afterwards. I'm just so unbelievably proud of him. It's been such a slog recently and I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 



He made this decision himself, and I'm insanely happy for him. No matter how this all turns out, whether it's successful or not, he's doing something. 



From a purely personal/selfish perspective, I'm insanely excited to see the man I fell in love with coming back. 



Background: my partner's struggled with alcohol pretty much the entire time I've known him. He works around alcohol all the time so it's super easy for him to casually drink most of the time. He also lost their dad last year which made things so much worse. I don't believe he's an alcoholic but has an unhealthy/dependant relationship with it, and has used it as a coping mechanism. 



He was definitely on the slippery slope towards alcoholism.



 It's caused arguments and upset and has been a constant source of worry for everyone who cares about him. I can't tell you how many times I considered leaving him because of it.",LunaandFin,self.happy,1572870461

happy,One of the best days I’ve had in a while was last week,"Ok so I mean nothing amazing like me winning the lottery or anything like that but last week on a Friday (also I’m a M15) I found a random 50$ bill in my pocket just out of nowhere, one of my best friends had bought this jacket about a year ago that looked badass (it was one of those fur jean jackets and it still does look as badass as ever) ofc when he came to school wearing it I asked him where he got it and he said he got it from a city abou 3 hours away. And my family wouldn’t drive 3 hours just to get a jean jacket but we looked at places like “Cavenders” a store that sells your basic cowboy needs (I live in TX btw) we  checked all over and couldn’t find one we even checked on amazon and eBay and Etsy but we couldn’t find one in my size they were all either children’s or XL adults. Then a few days ago my friend he owns the jacket told me he was gonna get a new one and that he’d let me buy the old Jean Jacket off him once he gets the new Jean jacket. Ok so after the whole Jean jacket thing happened on Friday night our house held this little party thing for our church where kids in my grade would come to my house and we’d just hang out and play games stuff like that and this girl in Spanish class (she used to go to my church but moved to another one but we walk together everyday to Spanish class)  and I kind of thought she liked me and so did my friends but anyway I told her to come to the little church thing that we were hosting and she actually showed up. We hung out and had a good time and she said she had a great time. May ask her on a date to the movies next week. But yeah that’s about all I know it doesn’t seem like my day was that great but all in all I just felt more happy that day idk why tho.

A week ago I suggested going today and we finally went! Sebastian has a ‘husband’ starting Wednesday.

We can’t get new kitty until he has been neutered, and we are keeping the two apart for about a week, getting used to each other’s smells and everything.

My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there...

Flashback 2008, I’m playing Final Fantasy XI, a popular MMORPG at the time, and message but good real life friend who I just saw run past me. Low and behold, it was a friend of his on his account. It wound up being a female on his account, we got to chatting and fell in love. A couple of back and forth from Texas to Florida and I’m sure I’d found the one. One paper we were an exact match. Same age, education, both love video games, both love dogs, etc..  we date for a while and things go well. We get married and for the first couple weeks things were great but started going down hill. We both made great money, I wanna go out to eat, she’d say ‘sorry can’t afford it’ then I’d come home the next day and she had bought a $5000 sewing machine without discussing it. Oh well, whatever. As time went on we started fighting more and more. Remember how I said we met on a video game and both loved them? She loves lore and questing, I skip quests and get straight into the action. It’s easy to overlook how something so simple as both loving video games can be so different. On paper we were an exact match but in reality we couldn’t be more different. Fast forward a couple of years and me, my father and friends walk into my house that we’re renting and infront everybody she says “I found a job back in Texas, you can come or not, either way, I don’t care” and looking back on it my mind was made up right then and there. 

Flash forward a couple a months as I was about to graduate so decided to stay behind as she went back to Texas, back in with her parents, and so I decided to stay in Florida until I graduated.  As I ran out our lease in our rental house and spent time alone I slowly realized how much better things were without her.  We went from talking 2-3 times a day to once a day then to 2-3 times a week. It was easy to see that our marriage was falling apart. As wrong as it was I was spending the time alone with an old friend (a female) and we were having a great time together which lead me to the realization that I can be happy and don’t need to settle. One day I stumbled across a Facebook comment she had left on a friends Facebook about going through a divorce, so I messaged her and she admitted to wanting a divorce. I was devastated, even tho I knew I could handle it and subconsciously wanted it myself. We got divorced in the end. 

Ok backstory complete....

I got back on the scene by asking my high school crush on a date to a movie. Keep in mind my family owns a movie theatre so it was just us after hours. The movie was a horror movie. I low key through a water bottle cap against a wall in pitch black auditorium and she nestled up against me. That was it. That was the moment I knew she was the one. Since that day we haven’t spent more than a day or two apart. At first she was resistant to get into a relationship because she had a three year old from another relationship.  After a while the introduction was finally made and I fell in love with this child immediately. Dates went from being at the bars to at Chuck E. Cheese’s. We eventually got married and had a child of our own. A beautiful baby girl. I love her more than anything. My wife’s interests you asks? Hasn’t played a video game in her life. She was a club goer while I chose to stay at home. She drank alcohol and at the time I hadn’t. She liked me who drove trucks, I drove an RX-8. On paper we were polar opposites but in the end we could be more perfect for each other. 

Thanks for reading. 

TLDR: first wife was a perfect on paper match but was crazy. Second wife was on paper polar opposite but couldn’t be happier.",Jinkaz1985,self.happy,1572666665

It mainly happened when he was with his friends and I was there

He told me he was going to be better and not get drunk around me and drink less for me. I was in the boat of ""I hope so, but we will see"" type of thing and he kept his word. He normally would have like 4+ drinks occasionally on nights he plays video games.

He had one drink and turned the game off so that we could have a movie night. I am glad that I have someone who is willing to change for the better. Thank you Alex, I love you.",skkdkekeie,self.happy,1573911711

Except I finally kissed him and we decided we’re official! 

The only downside is we have to be sneaky, we’re not allowed to date as coworkers. That means no posting cute couple pictures on social media until one of us leaves the job, no pet names or anything. But I don’t even care!

He gets along with my family so well and they all think he’s amazing and I agree. He’s so tall and warm and makes me laugh harder than anyone! I can talk to him for hours and hours, everything about him is so great. 

I have a bad habit of dating guys that do not truly care for me but I think it’s different with him. He feels really pure and genuine. He supports me so much and tells me about how much he loves my artwork and how I talk or my voice or anything. It’s a really fantastic feeling!

happy,"I get my day turned upside-down by a simply ""hello"" today. A word totally unexpected that make me feel happier and reduce my stress/my preoccupation","Yesterday I was at school studying in a corner of the classroom for my final exam. All alone, with only other 2 classmates near me, but they were doing other things

I was studying on my own when I hear an unexpected ""Hello"" incredible near to me. I raised my head up and I saw one of my classroom's sister watching me while smiling in my direction. She was the older sister of one of my classmate. After that we start having a small conversations, few minutes, but glad for it

I'm a very shy, introvert guy, that find difficult to open to people, to make friends and that is going trought bad years. But that simply ""hello"" turned my day. I wasn't expecting that and the fact that somebody notice me when usually people don't do that, they let me stay on my own, makes me happy, at least for one day

The girl I'm talking about is already married, with a baby and older than me. But IDK, I was thinking about it right now. She surprised me but at the same time makes me more calm. Maybe it can be stupid but I appreciate it, also now, after hours. It was a pleasure to have a conversation with her

happy,I made an unexpected fuzzy little friend while celebrating the 4th of July a day late!,"I live in a small town with a population of around 190 people. Tonight the fire department was doing a fireworks display (because it was raining last night). My mother, sister, and I were about to head over to where they were being set off when I spotted a stray kitten. I tried to get it to approach me in order to not frighten it but it ran of when my mother started the car. I decided at the time that it would probably go back to its presumably ally cat mother.

About 45 minutes later we returned. At first I didn't see anything but when I opened the car door to get out I heard I little meow. I then spotted the kitten hiding underneath a truck parked across the street. This time I was able to get it to approach me. After it calmed down I went and got it a bowl of water (I would have fed it too but it looked maybe a month old and, while I'm not certain, I think that is too young for meat).  Also, at this point my sister named her Callie.

My mother eventually went inside after about 10 minutes, followed by my sister about 30 minutes later. But I stayed outside still, afraid to pick her up because A: I didn't know how she would react, and B: Ultimately, she was an ally cat, getting bit would be really bad, especially considering that I'm allergic to cats. Anyway, after about 50 minutes of waiting the fire trucks that were at the fireworks display were getting back to the station which is actually across the street from my house. So I then finally picked up Callie and held her in my shirt to make sure she couldn't hurt either of us and walked over to the fire department to ask if they could help me out. They said they couldn't and to call the humane society. Well, the problem with that is that it was now 11 PM. So then I went back home and sat down with Callie.

I was getting ready to leave her briefly to make sure my dogs were already in bedrooms for the night so that I could take her inside when I heard a women's voice behind me. She said that the firemen told her about my problem. She then went on to say that she lives on a farm a few miles away and has 4 other cats and offered to take Callie.

I am just so happy that it worked out despite it being 11 PM in such a small town that I needed to find this sub.

Also, sorry for the lack of a picture, I was more concerned making sure Callie didn't wander off or get herself hurt than with taking pictures.",ExecutiveElf,self.happy,1562390558

At 18, I decided it was enough for me. I got a plane ticket and flew to another country, where I ended up getting married, and having a son!

It took me 3 years to break out of the depressive attitude that was pumped into me all my life, before I got my GED and accepted into University. For the first time in my whole life, I'm finally happy. And I've realised that, even if it takes me a bit longer to do math, for the most part, I actually am smart enough!

I put on weight (like 40 lbs, but I carry it well) and haven't done anything on my off days except watch TV, eat, and binge drink. Mainly, I'm just too exhausted to do anything active or even leave my house except to go to work.

Anyway, there's a guy at work who's been like my bff since we started working together last year. I never had any intentions of a relationship with him. He had a girlfriend, ex-wife, etc... We are just really close at work. Tell each other everything. But we never hang out outside of work.

He just left his girlfriend (she's a psycho that I've had to hear about since we've been friends) and moved in with his aunt. 

Last night, I invited him over for fireworks so he wasn't alone. He ended up sleeping over, and as we were laying down, he confessed that he's in love with me. He embraced me, told me how beautiful I am, how my smile and my eyes light up his day, and lots of other extremely sweet things that no one has ever said to me. He asked if he could kiss me and i said yes. We started making out, and one thing led to another. I kind of hesitated, because I hadn't shaved my legs in a few days and I feel uncomfortably fatter than normal.

It was the most beautiful thing. He wanted to look in my eyes, kiss me all over.

A little back story. I grew up in a very poor family that also happened to be very abusive(physically and mentally). We lived on govt. aid and my siblings and I were taken away a few a times from my mother and sent to live with strangers, neighbors, and ultimately our grandma ended up taking care of us as my dad was absent. I spent my teen years thinking I was never going to accomplish anything in life. I just really hated every aspect of my being. I never really thought about college nor cared about school because I honestly thought I would never make it that far. I met my significant other when I was 16, he really pushed me to better in school and try to make it through my home life. I moved out and in with him at 18. I've been working and going to school on and off since and I am now in my mid 20s. I could now envision more of a future for myself but I honestly didn't think I'd ever achieve it because I felt so behind in every aspect. I had a daughter a couple of years ago and that really pushed me to finally apply for the program. I got accepted on my first try and I am over the moon. I finally feel like I'm going to make it and everything is going to be okay.

Today, I'm so happy that my heart feels as if it might burst out of my chest. I've since found someone who helped me realize how much better I deserve, just how special I am, and what it feels like to be with someone who is actually a perfect match for you. We haven't been together long (a little over 2 months) but I feel something completely different for him than I've felt for anyone else. Every day I find something new about him to love. I fell for him hard and fast and that is scary but I've never been with someone who makes it so easy. He checks boxes for me that I didn't even realize I had. I just hope that he is The One. It sounds so cheesy but I just needed to get it out because I still can't believe the complete u turn my life has taken and it's overwhelming sometimes.
He and I mesh so well. 

During my last relationship, I just assumed it was normal to feel so insecure and unfulfilled. I thought to myself, ""Every relationship has its ups and downs and not everything can be perfect."" I look back and wonder how I convinced myself I wasn't yearning for more...and only now that I've found the things I was missing do I see just how effortless true love can be. I'm such a hopeless romantic, I know things aren't always what they seem. But I hope harder than I've ever hoped for anything before that he won't stop loving me, because this is what I've wanted for as long as I can remember. 

I don't care if a single person reads this, I just needed to put these feelings into words. I'm so unbelievably happy, and I never saw it coming. I just want to remember this euphoria on the days when life is getting me down. Thanks for listening, reddit.",macsnackpack,self.happy,1563632115

https://i.imgur.com/aqtRrTo.jpg

Max Power came into our lives over 16 years ago. He's been with us through the thick and thin. We have three other dogs, two other shi-tzus and a Samoyed, and Max has taken the alpha male role around the house. He's got a system, and when he's not feeling well we all feel it. 

Last February Max stopped eating regularly, and started losing weight. He was slowly declining and fading away. After several trips to the vet we were told it was the beginning stages of kidney failure but it could be treated. He did fine with the kidney treatments, but by this point he stopped eating entirely. He acted like he wanted to eat, but just couldn't. 

So I started syringe feeding him at this point to keep him going until we could figure out what was going on. Finally we were able to get him to an ultrasound and found the problem. Pyloric Stenosis, a condition where the pyloris thickens and creates a situation where food can not be ejected from the stomach into the colon. So he essentially always felt full. 

We decided despite his age we wanted to take the chance on surgery. We know him, and we know he wants to fight so we have him that opportunity. Surgery was on a Wednesday last April. And even though he seemed better Friday, he began a serious decline that weekend. He still had no interest in eating or drinking, he was fighting his syringe feedings, and even worse he was vommitting. Monday morning I took him into the vet, and the doctor told me that Max's intestinal wall wasn't healing, and wasn't likely to. We decided to give him until Wednesday, but I didn't know if he would make it. Things we're looking grim. 

Monday night was a nightmare. He laid on the couch in the same spot, staring off into space, his eyes were cloudy with death, and the look on his face was that of a dog who gave up. He had thrown up most of what I fed him that day, and he was declining FAST. He could barely walk now, and it was obvious he didn't want to. Lorie and I decided to put him down Tuesday morning, and spent Monday night with him keeping him comfortable and happy, telling stories about his epic 16 years on this planet. Monday night I decided since he would be gone the next day, I would skip his medication, and his feeding since he hated them so much, and when Tuesday came and he was still or less the same I also skipped breakfast and morning meds for him. Lorie stayed home Tuesday so we could say goodbye to Max as a family. 

Then around 10 AM something miraculous happened. We noticed Max was more awake, alert and was now following us around the room with his eyes. There was life there when there wasn't before. We knew we might be just seeing what we wanted to see, but we took it and ran with it. We spent Tuesday cleaning, singing and being as positive as possible. And sure enough little bits of life returned. Not much, but it was enough to make the decision to hold on longer. I started to research some of the meds he was on, and realized of the eight different medication he was taking, five of them had side effects of lethargy, excessive drooling, innapitence, nausea, vommiting, depression and anxiety. So I took him off of all of his meds except for his antibiotics, put him back on CBD, began a probiotic treatment recommended by my sister, and started using a special dog food diet for intestinal issues. 

The following Wednesday and Thursday were nothing short of miracle days. Slowly but surely all the things he hasn't been doing over the last few months began returning. He spent most of yesterday wanting to go to the dog park, following me around the house, barking at me too give him food, playing with toys, and peeing on the couch which is a sign that he's feeling better as that's been his spot for the last decade and he hasn't hit it in months. All of his routines and habits are coming back at lightening speed, all he needed to do was poop, to confirm the surgery worked, and to try to eat on his own. Last night he pooped and this morning for the first time in months he ate breakfast on his own. As I type this he's playing with his favorite Chewbacca toy as if the last two to three months didn't happen. 

All of this is completely surreal to us obviously. He was a sick sick sick dog, and we said goodbye to him so many times, but we didn't give up on him when he showed those signs of life. While this is what we were hoping for in our wildest dreams, it's not at all what we we're expecting. It's been such a long emotional road, I haven't slept in months and have dropped 13 pounds because I wasn't eating as well. I feared going to bed every night for the fear that the next day would be the one where I would have to say goodbye to my best friend of 16 years, my boy. But we didn't give up on him. 

Nearly 60 hours of syringe feeding, 20 hours of administering IV fluids at home, another 30 or so hours at vet visits, speciality clinics, and ultrasounds. IT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF IT. MAX POWER WON. HE BEAT DEATH AND HE DID SO WITH MAXIMUM POWER. 

There's a quote that has stuck with me through this whole thing:

“If only…the saddest words in the English language.” ― Kristan Higgins

I didn't want to spend my life wondering ""If only..."" And I'm so thankful I don't have to. I'm well aware that Max's case is the exception, and not the rule and that at his age we don't have much longer. But for the time we have left I will treasure every single day as if it's not only his last but mine as well. I'm so thankful for the lessons and challenges this ordeal has brought for it's made me, and my family that much stronger. 

It's now been several months since he's been getting better. Last year he was 18.8 pounds, three days after surgery he was 12.4 pounds, yesterday he was up to 14.8 pounds. all he wants to do now is eat and play and explore. It's almost as if he's getting younger again. 

We are back to business as usual. We spent this morning, as we do every morning at the dog park. And as usual he came home, ate a big breakfast and is now happily passed out on my lap.

happy,I found my husband’s secret stash.,"We keep no secrets from each other (except for keeping the door closed when we poop). I went looking for one of our old credit cards. He has a few little hidey holes for important stuff, he’s like WALL-E, so I went to his bedside table, bottom drawer, where he occasionally keeps old financial stuff. 

And there it was, just staring at me. I had no idea. 

Every card I’ve ever given him, every cutesy love letter, every sappy post-it. Stacked neatly in the back corner. Some in envelopes, some out. Over six inches high. Every card I fretted over, every page of handwritten 3AM hopes and dreams. I’m a writer, so words are important to me and they are the way I express myself when it’s difficult to do so verbally. He knows this. 

People always say it’s so nice to see how happy we are. That we’re “that couple”. I feel it. It’s not like we never left the honeymoon phase. We had some issues for a while, most people don’t know, but we pushed through and we’re both better partners because of it. I never thought I could be this happy. In a million years, I never would have dreamed that I could have this kind of loving, challenging, supportive, affectionate, sexy, silly, perfectly complimentary relationship. I feel lucky every day to have found this wonderful man and I will never, ever take it for granted. 

But seeing that stack of cards, even though it may seem small to some in the grand scheme of things, just really made me happy today. I told him I loved him for the first time in a rambling valentine’s day card, 7 1/2 years ago. We make a special point on every birthday, anniversary, whatever, to get the other person a nice card, write a little something. 

Maybe one day he’ll be looking for something and find my stash, tucked away in my bookshelf: a stack of every card he’s ever given me.",justkate2,self.happy,1563436898

happy,I wouldn't be here without his help. I'm finally doing good again!!," 

I'm bipolar 2 and I got an episode that  lasted the entirety of December up until yesterday. It was AWFUL. It  set my Generalized Anxiety Disorder on fire and I was crying all the  time, always anxious, sad, I didn't want to do anything - I didn't even  want to shower (I did though, don't worry). It was a very, very  difficult episode. I even had trouble sleeping and through several ways -  sometimes I could only sleep 4 hours, other times it'd take me up to  two hours to fall asleep even though I was tired.

But  here's where the amazing part comes - my fiancé. He was there  throughout the whole thing and supported me with so much love and  patience. It fills my heart up. There was a day in which I cried six  times and every time he'd hold me with patience and try to calm me down.  One of the times he was in a match of League of Legends ARAM and he  stopped just to hold me while asking the others to wait for just a  second.

This  Christmas was also my first one without my family. It was just the two  of us. Well, he bought me a whole bunch of little gifts from Wish and  AliExpress and handed them over to me during the 24th (I'm from  Colombia) and I couldn't help but to burst out crying again from  happiness. He got me a Teemo hat and a Fallout bubble head among the  many gifts.

I  just wish I could express to him how much I love him and thank God he's  with me. God knows what'd be of me if he wasn't around. Even small  little things like stopping his gaming to go lay down with me and browse  the iPad so I can fall asleep with someone there awake and know I'm  safe and sound. That's my favorite part. He turns on the lamp and lays  down right there beside me. No complaints about not being able to play,  no whining about being bored... He simply does it. Even if I ask him to  go play his games with his friends. I just love him. I really do.

I'm  sorry if I'm rambling but I really needed to finally rant and vent  about something good after such a long time of crying and being  miserable. If you got to the end, thanks for listening. Goodbye!!",WarchiefSnorlax,self.happy,1578493506

Over the past 4 months I think I've maybe used my kitchen as its intended maybe 4 times other than the microwave.

So over the holidays my aunt pulled me aside and handed me a book titled ""help! My apartment has a kitchen!"" A little condescending but she wasnt inaccurate and she told me ""you're never complete until you learn to cook"" 

Over the past 2 weeks since christmas I've been making some of the recepies in the book, and the first time I made something good with my own two hands I fucking cried, I have really bad depression most days and just generally feel like a failure sometimes but making something entirely myself that actually tasted great felt amazing, like a real accomplishment!

happy,I have accomplished a silly goal from when I was 8 - 11!," When I was about 7 I got my Xbox 360. 

When I turned 8 I started playing Call of Duty Black Ops 2, on Zombies mode, on the map Origins, there, you should put apart 4 magical staffs, the main problem being the fact the map is very claustrophobic, and there is a special, very hard to kill, enemy (and the normal zombies, of course)

Me and my cousin played it for years, until I was about 11 and he 12. We were never able to get all the staffs, the closest we had gotten was me with the ice staff, he with the fire staff, the wind staff only missing the magical stone that powers it, and the eletricity staff only missing the handle and the stone.

Now, after \~3 years, on a remastered version of the map, I went at it again, and after some 5 or 6 failed attempts and some luck I did it! I finally did it!!!!!!

happy,2020 is off to a great start for me personally!,"Hi yall, I just wanted to tell you all that so far 2020 has been off to a great start. Around this time last year I had no self confidence, a girl was toying with my heart and I just followed along like the puppy I was. I made her decide how I feel (if she was sad, I was sad. If she was angry, I was angry or really down because I thought she was mad because of me) and it was just a tough time for me.

Around the summer of 2019, after having an emotional breakdown at work I decided to contact a local mental health doctor (Non-English here, don't know the correct word for it) and she helped me through it and made me realize I had to change my life because otherwise I would be having a burnout. Also around this time I went on a vacation with the girl I was talking about above, and that made me snap out of my feelings for her based on what happened there (not going to disclose that)

I also started talking to a new girl. And this new girl made me realize so much about myself. How I am handsome, and that I shouldn't talk myself down. She told me to look into the mirror every day and tell myself three things: ""I'm handsome, I'm great and I am worthy""
Just saying those three things eventually made me start believing in it. And most importantly, I was coming more out of my shell! Even to this day my colleagues tell me that they are proud of me for coming out of my shell more. But what's most important to me is that my mum recently gave me a long lasting hug and told me ""I have a new son now. Thank you"". Not gonna lie folks, it made me tear up because my mum and I had alot of issues when I was growing up

It is now 2020. Since New Years Eve, I've hung out with the new girl pretty much every day. She keeps reminding me how much she appreciates me, how she's always there for me and that she is really proud of me as well.

I'm proud of me as well.

Anyways folks, what I'm trying to say here is that if you are not confident in yourself, or doubt yourself, take a step back and look at who's in your life and see if they are making you feel those things or not. Also most importantly get help. I cannot emphasize that enough.

Have an amazing day everyone, and a fantastic 2020. You've got this and I believe in you!",TechnologyZero,self.happy,1578294017

Next, I am trying to be more fit. I’ve set a baseline of 100 pushups each day which has been no issue so far, but have also done a few other exercises as I feel fit. Also gone for a few short runs, but having not run in 4 years I am struggling. As a young guy I should be able to do more, but I’ll work up to that. 

Also, I have already been reading much more this year. And last of all, I have even started flossing. (I know I should have been doing this for a long time I’m sorry to the dentists out there)

happy,"My beloved stray was adopted by neighbors I don't know, but have a huge window I walk past daily","Fancy Pants (hopefully FKA, I don't know why I came up with the name, but it stuck) was this lady cat I met when I moved past summer. She's kind of decrepit in appearance to some, [this is her almost toothless blep from something I previously posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blep/comments/dxr86p/fancy_pants_my_favorite_strayporch_cat_has_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), but she's such a cuddly cutey.

I couldn't find her for a week. This time yesterday, I was accepting something happened and she was gone, hit by a car, stomped by some cat hater, who knows...

And then...

I walked farther down the street yesterday afternoon, moping to my boyfriend that ""she's dead, something happened!! I KNOW IT!""

""Why do you always assume the worst, she's probably fi- OMG LOOK""

there my fancy pants was, in some person's window, I could see she saw me and was screaming meowing!!

She's fine and she has a home!!!!

I would've taken her in for at least a while (there's no way she had a human, she was filthy) but my landlord has said in no uncertain terms I am at my cat limit haha. 

But YAYYY. I'll see her thru the window now, and I'm so happy had to share.",acctforsadchildhood,self.happy,1578244098

happy,"Dylan, and the Importance of Being in the Present Moment","Just made music with a blind man named Dylan. I was playing guitar, and I noticed someone sit down a few meters away with a drum. At first, we didn't ask names, I just asked if I could play with him. I didn't play any songs in particular, but I felt the music and I could tell he could too. We were both present and feeling the rhythm, it was truly beautiful. Afterwards, we shook each other's hands and introduced our names. I could tell that we made a connection even if he wasn't looking at me I knew he understood the importance of music.

Really made me feel grateful that I am able to see the beauty of the world and read. However, it was also a great experience because I met someone nice, someone, who is still able to enjoy life even with unfortunate conditions. It really gave me hope that I can find unconditional happiness, and I hope in some way that insight can be shared with you. 🙂",Shinynothing,self.happy,1560242997

happy,He’s not an ogre. But he made me happy today.,"I’m 348lbs down from 378lbs in January. All by just stop eating what I’m intolerant too. Which happens to be wheat, gluten, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, soy, oranges, coffee, peanuts, and brewers yeast (whatever that is). So I’ve cheated a bit. I allow one meal which ends up being a weekend every other weekend to have real food two nights. 

I’m about to end that because it just causes so much tummy troubles. But my husband who loves my body the way it looks and feels now has been trying to sabotage my goals and I having little willpower have allowed it. Well this week he has decided to change his ways. He sees me truly wanting this. And he has halted trying to give me snack cakes or cookies. He still buys them and I had one tonight but he said I was cut off after one and I wouldn’t get anymore until later this week if I’ve been good lol.

I told him this morning the belt he just bought me was tight and it barely fit but I said soon I’ll shrink to fit it. And it’s the first time he’s said “yes you will”. He’s always been neglectful in that way. He doesn’t want me to lose weight too much. Just to be healthy. However, with the 30lbs list he’s seen my come more out of my shell and not be so shy. My social anxiety is loosening it’s grip on me slowly. I’m nowhere, where I want to be. I told him when I get into a size 16, but will be men’s pants size 36 we will then decide on if I want to continue and go smaller. I’m not looking to be tiny, but I do want abs and toned arms, shoulders, back, and legs. I’m my mom’s height so I think it would be around 180lbs. I’m not looking for absolute six pack abs. If there’s just slight definition and I like it I’ll stop and maintain. I don’t want to be unattractive to my husband and he doesn’t like sculpted bodies. So I’m keeping his interests along with mine. I think we will find a happy middle ground. 

But “happy” sub because in 10 years that we’ve been together he has finally said some encouraging words about me losing weight. And that was a huge boost in feeling loved. 

I love him more and more everyday. It’s not been easy, but it’s been well worth it.",squishiebutt2020,self.happy,1560224086

happy,I finally have almost everything where I always dreamed it would be.,"In 2014, I moved to Vermont. I didn't know anyone and I was very depressed. I wanted to move back and hide in my parents basement, I was embarrassed of leaving college and doubting who I was and where I was going. I knew 4 things I wanted out of life. 1. Become a teacher 2. Own my own home 3. Get married 4. Have my own cat(s) 
 So I made steps to make these a reality. 
1. This Thursday, is my last day of school as a 3rd grade year. It was my first year and it was amazing!  
2. Last summer my boyfriend (now husband) and I bought our first house, it's been a wild ride. 
3.This past May we got married, it was our dream wedding. In our living room with just our parents, and our two cats, Obsidian and Onyx. 
4. We got Obsidian a few years back from a local animal rescue and Onyx this past year at another animal rescue. 

I guess, life is a wild ride but I can finally say I'm happy with it. Took five years, it's not perfect, but I'm happy. Finally.",obsidian49,self.happy,1560209790

happy,I am so happy to have my bestfriend in my life; they probably saved my life,"I was in such a low place a few weeks ago. My bipolar disorder was out of control. I was getting more and more depressed. I was starting to have some dark thoughts. Then I reached out to my friend, who I'd had a falling out with. They agreed to try and patch things up. Since then, my life has become so much better.


1. I quit drinking, something which I've had really bad problems with for about 5 years now. 


2. I started working out again. Lost a few lbs too, people have been noticing.


3. I talked to my psych and started actually dealing with my problems and getting new meds.


4. I started taking care of my personal business and appearance. I had moved into this place over a month ago and never unpacked. I unpacked all of it in about 3-4 days. I went to a hair stylist for the first time in like 3 months. This is gross, but I started showering regularly. 


5. Eating healthy is hard for me, cause of my debt. But my friend got me a slow cooker, so now I can eat healthy without spending too much. 


6. As of this weekend, I also quit weed, cause I think it's causing problems with my bipolar disorder. 


Obviously, I did these things. And I did it for myself. But damn, having someone there, makes all the difference. It inspires and gives you drive, knowing that you are not alone. 


So this is a happy story. This is a story about how I'm so happy and how lucky I feel, to have such an awesome person in my life. It's because of them that I'm stepping out of my comfort zone and actually just joined a meetup group and asked for permission to go to their event on Thursday.

happy,"I slapped a guy, and then he asked me out","A little backstory, I met this guy when I was 18 and he was 16. I worked retail with his mom, and she and I became friends. I never gave him a second thought, cause I was a know it all 'adult' and he was just a 'kid'.
Anyways, two years later he gets a job overnights where I worked. I had the early shift, so he would be leaving as I was coming in. Since I was friends with his mom, we started exchanging polite talk. 
There were times that he would have to wait for a ride home, and if he had to wait long we would hang out on my breaks. I guess you could say we became friends.
Fast forward a little longer, he was 20 now and I was 22. One day he came over to chat in the morning like normal, we started bantering and one thing led to another and he pretends to slap me (places hand on cheek gently and make a slapping sound with his mouth).
Me being a brat goes to do the same thing but then my dumb butt accidentally swings a little to hard and I straight up slapped him. I had never felt so guilty. Without realizing it i got really close to him (we usually kept a little distance) and I realized then how blue his eyes were.
He said it was okay but scurried off pretty quick. I thought I had messed up our friendship. 
Then a week of almost no contact he came up to me and asked me out. 
Four years we have known each other and all it took for us to start dating was for me to slap him.

happy,You never know what lies on the other side of discomfort!,"If you need some motivation for that job interview or do get something done, here is a little story. 


7 months ago I had my first ever job interview. It just so happened to be for a job I really wanted since I'd always dreamed of working in a museum (I've been studying History for the past 3 years). Furthermore the wage on offer was significantly higher than what any of my friends were earning. When I left the house with all my fanciest clothes I realised that I hadn't worn my dress shoes in a while and they were far too small, eating away at my heel. I had about a 35 minute walk to do in these shoes but I had no alternative pair. I stopped and hesitated for a moment wondering if I should go on, after just a few steps I could feel that blood had started to seep out and it was extremely painful to walk. However I realised that this was 'the moment' that I would look back on in a few months time with either pride or shame. I decided to keep going, literally limping my way to the train station. I finally arrived at the museum only to realise, from talking to other people, that out of about 20 of my peers I was the **only** person who's email did not state that I had to prepare a 10 minute talk to upsell an interesting object. Now I really knew that today was my day! I showed the incomplete email to the interviewers who were extremely apologetic and said I could have as much time as I wanted to myself in a different room to prepare. Looking in my bag, I could see I only had a paper notepad so...it would have to do. Instead of complaining about my 'bad luck' , I didn't take any time on the side and listened to the other presentations which were excellent (most of the people had prior tour/museum experience). I then stood up and explained why this particular notepad was the best one money could buy. 



*Looking at interviewers* 'I see all of you have cups of water with you, now if you had a normal paper notepad and you spilled your water, you'd lose all of your precious notes! With this notepad and it's waterproof cover page you can be sure that your notes are safe! Etc. Etc. 



Limping my way back home, I really didn't think I had much of a chance at getting the job. All the people there were older, much more experienced and , in my eyes, considerably better suited for the job. The following week I basically stayed at home and didn't go to university since I found it nearly impossible to walk, the shoes had cut through multiple layers of skin and the pain was excruciating. 



However, just a few days later, I got a call telling me that I had got the job and contracted hours too! Ever since then it has been an absolute dream, working with amazing people and in a great environment. I've now finished my University (My studies and work overlapped for about 6 months) and I really couldn't be happier! I hadn't thought much about my decisions on that day but now when I think back I feel extremely proud for not giving in since it has paid off tremendously! 



I hope you all have an amazing day and remember to smile! :)",kamcio616,self.happy,1561275748

We knew it was real but didn't know what it would lead to.   After a year of dating which was a wonderful experience I proposed to her and a year later we were married.

happy,was able to use first aid on a 80mph+ accident on the autobahn today. god i wish i could do that as a profession,"yeah so i am working in IT consulting and pretty much hate my job. I am one of those people bindge watching ambulance / police youtube stuff. what happened today: 
i was on my way from a to b on the autobahn, doing my 90kmh (55pmh) grandpa-style on the very right lane behind some truck, when all of a sudden an accident occured involing two cars pretty much right in front of me, maybe 200-300m (~200 yards). one car crashed and stoped onto the central leitplanke (no idea of the english word. google translate. the static thing dividing the two sides of the autobahn), the otherone first crashed into the central leitplanke, then rapidly landed in the page dig (google translate again. the meadow next to the 3 lanes of the autobahn). or in one sentence: i saw a fucking car go from 120/130 kmh (80pmh) to 0 in like less then 5 secs via flying into the meadow next to the road.

what happened now feelt like a minute, but must have been 30-40min as from what i was able to recontruct using multiple date:

1) quick stop
2) warning blinker
3)  stopped on the shoulder
4) called 911 (112 here), made sure they come here
5) while calling, grabbing my safety vest (its the law to have it near you so you can reach it without leaving your seat), leaving the car and rushing to the wrecked car
6) when i arrived, the co-pilot was already able to get the driver, who was pretty fucked up out of the car
7) got a first aid kid from another car that stoped. put on gloves and got a bandage on the dudes forehead that was beeling . calmed him down, told him to keep lying down and that police, ambulance were on their way. 
8) by that time, maybe 1-2min later a volunteer first responder who was near stoped and took over. which is where i joined another dude to make sure a rescue alley was properlly installed. god that was fun pointing at cars, telling them to here and there, yelling at shitheads who were too stupid to understand the basic principle of get-the-fuck-out-of-the-way 
9) we managed the traffic, until police/ambulance came in, when all of a sudden a helicopter appeared who simply landed on the 3 lanes of the autobahn. talked to the pilot later on, asking him weather its normal that they do this without anyone instructing/helping them. he was like: yeah we dont do this any more. takes too much time that is being needed by the people involved in the accident. which is why we simply land. 

thats pretty much it. 
couple minutes later, tons of police, ambulance and firemen were on sight, which is when i took off back to my car. took another 40min to clear the road from garbage and the two wrecked cars, before traffic continued.

one random guy, not being involved came up to me and told me that i did a good job and that he wasnt sure if he would have stoped. 

i think the last time i was that happy, was when my son (now 15 months) was born. 
i wish i could do this for a living.
sadly driving an ambulance vehicle and operating as a medical person is payed like shit in germany. i would maybe 25-33% from what i would do now. 

had to write that down somewhere to clear my head.

I am looking for participants for my two-part, online study which aims to understand the importance of ‘being yourself’. Psychologists have suggested that being yourself is closely related to positive psychological wellbeing and sexuality and so we are trying to explore this. The first part of the study should take around 20 minutes. By participating you can enter a prize draw to win one of five £/$/€ 20 Amazon vouchers. Please click the link below.

happy,"My boyfriend and I broke up, I got a new job","He wasn't a bad boyfriend or anything, I spent my time mourning, but he didn't have a car and I constantly had to drive 2 hours to pick him up and 2 hours back because I didn't like his family. At $70 to a tank of gas, his inability to split the cost with me, and the fact that I was driving a 2006 Ford you can see why I didn't much enjoy this practice. Anyway, we broke up, so that's 4 less hours of driving every other weekend I had to do. 

My current job is an hour away. I have to drive that rattletrap murdervan an hour every day to work for $8.50 an hour and drive an hour back home. Again, you can see why I don't like this arrangement. I didn't live that far away when I got the job, but things happen and I moved. 

Before I moved I used to share a bedroom with my ex. Yeah, it was an uncomfortable situation. 5 people lived in a small 2 bedroom apartment for $830 a month. To top it off I had to pay $15 in pet rent a month. 

So we moved. My boyfriend left me. And I got a new job. 

I'm single so I don't have to go pick anyone up. My new job is literally a 10 minute bike ride away and pays more than my last job. (I can make it in 6 minutes if I book it. 10 if I coast most of the way.) To top it off it frankly seems much *easier* than my previous job too. Walmart is even closer than my work. Dollar General, Little Ceasers, and Game Stop are all about as close by. 

My new rent is $700 a month, 3 bedroom, spacious living room, and my Own. Fucking. Room. 

Starting July 4th I won't have to buy gas again. I won't have to pay insurance. That's easily 300 extra bucks a month I can just blow on bullshit if I wanted but I'm probably gonna save it.

So grateful for everyone involved in my treatment and recovery.
I'm now 70lbs lighter, much more active and getting daily exercise. (I'm pretty sure that pushing uprights and grand pianos up flights of stairs counts as exercise!) Cholesterol is down along with my blood pressure and my A1C.
Life is so much better! I moved back to Wisconsin where I fell most at home. Mentally, physically, geographically, socially, spiritually and financially leaps and bound ahead of where I was 8 years ago. And the last 19 months have been the best part because of one amazing, beautiful woman ❤️

my grandma past away 3 weeks ago. She was very sick. i basically saw her get worse, i watched her suffer, until she past. I'm 14. She was and still is the thing i love the most in this difficult world. Her passing hurt me so much and i'm still working on it. Last night, i got so sad and i didn't know why, i had a decent day and then all of a sudden, i was crying, and feeling shitty.. i talked to a friend and i was basically saying everything i'm bad at. Saying ""i need my grandma"".. i went to bed bc i was tired of crying quietly in my room, and i didn't want to annoy my friend and my phone was on 1%...
Anyways, I went to sleep and something personal happened.. we told the guy (13) and the mom and my Uncle and Aunt about what he did... then i went into another room and there she was.. my grandma! she wasn't sick anymore she was smiling and okay! she basically said she loves me and that she's ok.. she accepted how much i love her and said ""i love u as much as u love me"" and we hugged.. then i woke up.. burst into tears, woke up my sister, told her what happened. then my mom walks in and my sister says ""she had a nightmare"" and i said ""i- i didn't, we told the guys mom what he did.. then i saw oma and she was okay and smiling and said she loved me"" my mom then said ""i had a feeling she would come to you first, she's telling you she is okay where she is and loves you, and that's the best dream you can have"" 
ITS TRUE! i was so sad and depressed last night that all i wanted was Oma (grandma) and to hug her.. AND THATS WHAT HAPPENED!! She's watching over me and she happy.. and- knowing she's watching me is almost like a closure of me wondering ""is she ok"" bc now i know she is!!! the fact that she was in my dream, before my siblings and her daughter and her son just shows that she loves me just as much as i love her.. and i'll be ok now.. i can't stop crying happy tears... 😅😁 ❤️🖤💙

I have this curtain way of making them that I love so much :) First, instead of using cooking spray on the pan, I use butter to add to the flavour of the pancake. I make the batter as normal, then I add cinnamon into the batter. Once I put it onto the pan on the stove, I put in white chocolate chips and sometimes blueberries. Lastly I serve them with blueberries ontop and some strawberries on the side and sometimes with whip-cream.

I'm eating the plate I just made now, I can't wait to be able to make them for a boyfriend/girlfriend some day :)",ToeSuckerAssEater69,self.happy,1581128247

happy,"After a very hard work week, one of my tenants called me and made my week!","Sorry in advance, I've never posted to this sub and this is going to be a little long but I wanted to share this uplifting experience;

To preface, I work as a building manager dealing with the day to day dealings and issues in a large apartment complex. My job can be very draining, as well as and emotionally exhausting. This week was very hard as I had an issue with a resident being very volatile and many of the residents were upset and unfortunately I am the first face they see when that happens so I get a lot of negative words and insults thrown my way. 

I came home today and I am on call and one of my tenants names popped up on the after hours phone and I picked up (as you do), ready to get another grievance regarding the disruptive tenant. What I got instead was completely the opposite, I don't usually speak much about my residents however this wonderful person is someone that I feel I need to talk about. This tenant is so so lovely, she is so sweet and in every interaction she tells me how much she loves living here and that she is so happy with how the place has changed for the better since I took over. She asked to extend her lease and told me that I was kind and wonderful. I needed to hear that after this week, she is so full of kindness and support, she works with children with disabilities and her patience and grace comes through in everything she does, she even said how grateful she was that I answered the phone even though it was after hours (I was off about 2 hours ago). She also said that she had lived in a complex when she was in her youth and was happy to see more activities that I had started doing to get to know your neighbors better. She made my whole day.

 Her and people like her are the reason that the world has safe places and light in a world that can at times feel unrelenting and bleak. If you are on this subreddit you are a person who contributes to that and I thank you.",aniebananie1,self.happy,1581126093

happy,Helping a colleague,"So there's this girl that I work with, and for the last year or two I've been getting kind of concerned about her. Not really about little things either - she came to the Christmas party with a weird mark on her face, and when I pressed her on it later (thinking it would be something silly we could joke about) she revealed that when she felt bad she would headbutt her wardrobe until the bad thoughts went away.

Internally I was like 'Holy shit she self harms' but obviously externally I spoke to her a bit. I couldve done a better job at that - some things came across as generic as fuck - but I'm not really an orator, and I was very much put on the spot 

Other things have since come up, nothing quite at that level but enough to remind me that things weren't ok with her. After every shift when she'd be not right, I'd message her just to check she wasn't going home and doing something really bad. Stuff like ""You ok? You seemed a bit down today, want to go out for a drink with *workmate* and *workmate*?""

Anyway one that really stood out to me was that at the end of my shift, I went into the kitchen to sort myself out a coffee and she was lying on the floor. Fully conscious, physically fine but just lying there.
My internal klaxons went through the roof - I got her sat at a table, fetched her a warm drink and went to speak to the manager. We arranged a bit of an agreement - she could go home early if I covered her shift, which I said yes to. She looked rough but we got her on the bus that takes her to right outside her grans house.

I finished her shift - thank god for free coffee - and messaged her about what was going on was she ok etc etc and she was pretty vague about the whole thing but we spoke until i was comfortable with her mental state, that she wasn't going to do anything stupid.

But, and this is the important thing, I finished that conversation with the sentence ""don't be a stranger alright talk to me any time""

Today she messaged me asking if I thought she should take antidepressants. I know that this is a difficult thing to hear so I was as tactful and supportive as possible, but I told her that antidepressants are each different and only effective with other mental health care as well, else she would just depend on drugs to be happy.   I reccomended she speak to a therapist/counsellor and she agreed!

I know the mental health issues aren't fixed and I know that the road to recovery is long and treacherous at times, but I am over the moon that this girl is finally seeking help.",Dappl3jack,self.happy,1581095706
happy,Three years ago I was at rock bottom. But I found friends that helped me trust again and I am so extremly happy about them and where I am today.,"This made me very happy, so I want to share it with you.

I got hurt very badly in my past and lost my ability to trust others out of the fear to get hurt again. I was struggling, almost no friend and constantly mistrusting the few ones I had, because some assholes in the past decided to break my trust.

But not anymore. It started almost three years ago. I have managed to meet amazing people, including my now best friend, who have accepted me as I am, even if I am sometimes weird. There are so many things they did, that just make me tear up from happiness, when I think about it.

They were the first to remember my birthday outside of my family. They surprised me with a birthday cake and a little motivational book and I was just so amazingly happy. The little book still has a special place on my desk.

They were the first to convince me to try and go to a party. I had never gone out before, but they even helped me to dress up and do some makeup and made it such an amazing experience, I still cherish it today.

They accepted, that I don't like to get drunk. Everyone I knew before them always pushed me get drunk to have ""fun"". They just accepted that I don't want to drink and now they even make me some tea, when we hang out, because they know I will drink the tea while they get drunk. It makes me so happy, that they not only accept how I am, but even prepare something so I feel better!

They were there for me, when I had a breakdown. When I broke down an started to mistrust everyone again and felt like I would fall into a black hole, my best friend even called me to make sure I am okay. She even offered to go and openly ridicule the person who made me feel this bad and this support just made me so happy to have a friend who supports me, even if I am down.

I could go on and on, but I just want to say, that I am very happy and feel very lucky to have let these special people into my life. Three years ago, I thought, that I could never trust anyone again and that everyone would just abuse me. Now I know, that this is not true. There are amazing people, who cherish me and like me the way they are. They have taught me to trust others and myself gain. And for this I will be forever grateful.",Nartarus,self.happy,1583742245
happy,It’s my first time celebrating my birthday (Fnow19) and this has literally been the most excited and best day of my life!,"So a little backstory (not to make anyone sad or get pity but I just want y’all to understand why this is such a big deal for me) 

For the first 18 years of my life I was in foster care with an incredibly abusive family (physically, sexually, emotionally) so of course my birthday wasn’t even remembered by them and I had no friends growing up because of a rumor someone spread about me letting my dad do stuff to me. All pretty wild and fucked up. Butttttt it’s okay because they finally found proof of all that and justice has been served to both of the parents. And then on my 18th birthday I was in the hospital because my genetic now seizure disorder had started and that was a really bad one. 

Now, I’m in a super great relationship, a nice house, have an amazing cat, getting a service dog soon. But today is the first time I’m celebrating my birthday too. I’ve always seen it as another day and tried to ignore all the cool things other people did for theirs so I didn’t feel like I was missing out. Of course my wonderful boyfriend that I live with wasn’t going to let that happen and man was I actually missing out. 

It’s only 2 hours into my birthday and he already got me my favorite food, gave me my present which was a piano I’ve been saving up for for a long time, and a really really long and sweet letter about how much I mean to him and how much he loves me. I still have 22 hours left on my birthday but I honestly can’t imagine how it could get better than this? I mean birthdays are really amazing. I’ve never been reminded how much someone loves me this much or been so spoiled and it’s a lot to take in but I just feel so good. And now I’m really excited to celebrate all the rest of mine (:

I know this was really dumb and pointless because it’s just a birthday but I’m just insanely happy right now and I didn’t know I could feel like this so I felt like I should share with anyone who cares to read",AcrylicLotus,self.happy,1583737235

My doctor is a good listener, and she's helping me get myself back on track. I have hope that I will be back to my happy, optimistic, outgoing self. 

I've had depression so long that my husband has never known me without it. I cannot wait to be the wife he deserves.

In the beginning of my depression, I gained 80lbs. I have lost almost 30 in the past year, as I bumbled my way through life. Now I'm starting a real fitness habit: yoga in the morning, pilates in the evening. If I can lose 30lbs with no specific intention, I know I can lose the rest if I put my mind to it. 

I started regulating my sleep schedule this week, no more sleeping all day. And it's working. I still feel pretty groggy, but I'll be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed once I develop the habit.

I still have a lot of work to do, and a long way to go, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The first few miles are always the hardest, but eventually, as the body is strengthened, you begin to enjoy hiking, and can spend more time looking around than making sure that one foot goes in front of the other.",MrsKryptik,self.happy,1582307010

I've been fat for my whole childhood/adolescence. In my junior year of high school (2016) I got to more than 100kg, and to a 1,63m guy that's pretty fucking heavy. Throughout high school I actually managed to lose some weight but not that much (always fluctuating up and down on the 100 mark), and on senior year I promised myself that would be the last year I would weigh that much, so I decided to not enroll on a uni right away, so I took a gap semester to focus on myself and to try to get shit done. Started 2019 going to an endocrinologist, he pointed wich directions I should take if I truly wanted to be healthy again, so I started doing a heavy diet (supervised by the doctor), I stopped drinking (heavily) and of course, started doing a lot of exercises (mostly cardio).

Long story short? I managed to lose more than 40kg in less than 10 months, I now weigh less than I did more than 10 years ago. And I know I should have posted this a while ago, but I could only find the confidence and self-esteem to say and admit that I did an amazing thing this year of 2020. For the longest time I just thought and assumed everything I did wasn't something worth to be proud of, but now I can finally see how wrong I was. It's ok to be proud of yourself, and YOU should be.

And now some proof to show I'm not just karma whoring...

I’m so excited! As an adult I’ve never really been close with someone who’s going to be having a baby. I can’t wait to watch this kid grow up! It’s been so long since our close family had a little kid running around (my youngest cousin was the last one and he’s only 2 years younger than me). 

I never plan on having a baby myself, but I’ve always said that if someone in my family needs a babysitter for a day or two I’d be glad to do it. I might finally get that opportunity! I’m so excited!",Musician_Moneyless,self.happy,1582127289

happy,I’m feeling happy more than I ever been but scared it might end.,"Hi there. I have finally started feeling happy once again. I haven’t felt happiness in such a long while and I feel like a new me and I know I will never be the same person before i fell down a spiral but I have accepted that bc me and him befure I let depression hit me hard are completely different people. If the past me saw me now he be confused as who I am. Well to get to it. I’m feeling happy. I have feel this happiness since the end of December to now. I have felt like shit I’m January fir a couple of days where I nearly spiral and did something stupid, but o got help and here I am today. I’m feeling happy bc I genuinely want to keep on living bc I feel happier than I ever did bc I have these two friends who I appreciate so much especially since they have stayed with me when o have been the worse friend possible. I have been such a bad friend to them and I’m just hoping I can just be the best friend possible to them. Next I have my mom. Me and her have a weird relationship a very weird one bc of something that happen in 2016 things between us have been different bc I changed after August. I have been such a crap son and brother. I have tested her like shit ik I have and I want to try and get a relationship back with her especially since she has been there for me even though it’s tough to open up to her about my problems/depression bc last time I did she got mad at me and said it was just nothing. And I also have this girl that means a lot to me. But things between her and I are going good imo. But I can’t answer for her. She has been someone who has helped me and gave me the fucking kick I needed to get off my ass and stop fucking pitying myself bc I did a lot of that and she told me straight facts about how she saw how I was being and it opened my eyes to how I was running myself into the ground. Without her telling me how I was just being a loser and feeling pity for myself I probs be dead rn and that’s no joke. I legit planned on ending my life before my 20 birthday this year which have came and past. So she saved me from myself and I owe her a great deal bc with her in my life I have started changing things and trying to get a job and stuff. Still no luck in a job but got a volunteer position currently which will help in the long run. She means a lot me and I hope she knows how much she matters to me bc she’s the best person ik and I like her. I hope he realises this and hope she feels the same. But recently my mood has changed it happened this Sunday and took full effect on Monday. Ik my depression is trying to take over my mind again and I’m not going to let it but I have fucked up bc of my depression creeping back in my life slowly. Bc of this I kinda fucked things up with the girl I like. But I’m not going to give up on what we have made together bc she genuinely is someone who means a lot to me. And I’m if I want to keep what I have right now I need to find a way to control my depression so it’s not as strong as it was last year bc I’m not going to go back to how I was feeling last year bc if I do tthere’s guarantee that I make I out alive and I don’t want the girl I like my to friends and my mom to have to deal with bein depression and feeling ready to die at a moment’s notice.  Bc I have plans I want to accomplished before the end of. This year. One Of them is a job so I can start saving cash so I can buy or rent a place for myself. Move out of my parents house and start living my life like I want to live it and I also want to take the girl I like and treat her like she should be treated. Also I want to rescue or find someone who’s selling a ferret bc I want a pet ferret bc they are cute. Thanks fir reading this incredibly long post. I don’t expect u all to read all of this but thanks. And thank u to the girl and the two friends who have been there for me no matter what.

On our last day in the lab My boss gave us all a care package of gloves, surgical masks, and alcohol pads. He fought hard and was able to keep everyone one the payroll without having to use sick days or personal time. And he has us do a video conference twice a week to chit chat, gossip, catch up on out home projects, and help keep us sane. He even encourages us to bring our pets in on the video conferences as our “lab assistants”.

Almost not real. All day, every day i just feel so happy and inspired. Wanting people to hear what ive been thinking and see what ive created because i feel like maybe someone can relate to me. Or connect. At the end of the day, when i eat my edibles, it intensifies the feeling of happiness and it feels overwhelming but in a good way. I decided to start recording my thoughts to share because i feel like having these thoughts and feelings without sharing them is a waste.

happy,"Random acts of kindness make you feel better, I promise.","So, last night I was playing fortnite with my roomie/our homie and decided to go outside for a cigarette. Sitting on the front porch of our apt complex just past 10pm, an older man walks up the sidewalk maybe 20 feet in front of me. 

“Excuse, me, can I ask you a question?” He says. “What?” I say back a little hesitantly, as my city is known for high rates of crime. “Listen, sir, I don’t mean to bother you or disrespect you in any way sir, I’d shake your hand but with all the virus stuff..” — “yeah that’s fine I understand. What’s up?” I ask him. He sits down, “So, I was just released from **** prison and they gave me this,” shows me his release papers and some piece of notebook paper with poorly scribbled instructions, “I just did 6 years and they let me out today and I was down the street at the bars and I asked this man if he could spare me any change, I just need 6.95 for the bus man and he threw a quarter at me and said “here you go n**,” I looked at him in horror as he said that last part, “dude what? are you serious? that’s fucked up man nobody deserves that...” I didn’t know what else to say. He said the bouncer came over and kicked the guy out after witnessing the entire thing. “So please man, I’m hungry, Im tired, I just want to go home and see my family..” he said as he started to cry. 

Quick aside, I’m not sure if any of you have seen a grown man cry, but to see that level of despair in a person is gut wrenching. 

“Hold on, Ill be right back.” I said “oh, okay, thank you sir.” he said, sitting on the bench still. I went into the complex and grabbed as much change as i could fit in my hand and then looked in my wallet. There was a 20$ bill in it. I stood there for maybe 3 seconds, before grabbing it and stashing it in my pocket. I went back outside, to see him still sitting there crying, head in his hands. 

“Hey man, this is all the change I had,” i said, pouring it into his hand “thank you sir really thank you so much,” he started to try and thank me, “but here,” i pulled out the bill, “go home and see your family.” He leapt from his seat and hugged me. “THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH OH THANK YOU LORD THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!” he couldn’t stop himself. “Go home.” I said kindly again as I patted his back, finally being released from the bear hug of a stranger. He started off, still hollering thank yous, literally jumping up in the air kicking his heels with excitement as I walked back inside. 

I didn’t tell my roomie or our buddy what I did. I have no idea what that man is going to do with that money. But, I have a feeling he wasn’t lying to me. To open up with honesty about having just been released from prison, I felt like what he said after that was sincere. He just wanted to go home and see his family. 

The world is a very trying place, some of us have it much easier than others. And right now we’re all facing something exceptionally challenging with this global pandemic changing social life entirely. We should always remember to treat our fellow humans with dignity, respect, and kindness, ESPECIALLY, in times like these. We are being tested as a species and we must not fail. We have to work together in order to make it out of this. All over the world, people will lose loved ones. Brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, friends. 

“Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.” 

We are all entrenched in a battle right now. Divided we are weak, Unified we are strong. 

KEEP GOING! LETS GO CHAMP!  NOW GO, MAKE IT A GREAT DAY!!!!! ✌🏻🤟🏻🤘🏻

happy,I made a shirt for myself based on counseling! :) Feeling happy/proud so I wanted to share!,"Hi everyone! I hope you are all happy and healthy - or working towards it :) 

I just got a Cricut and wanted to try making a shirt so this is my first attempt. (I'll explain it first)

I really struggle with self-confidence - I have such a hard time thinking that I am pretty enough, or smart enough, or good enough for anything- but my counselor has really been helping me feel like I am a decent person who deserves to be happy! So I was telling him the other day how grateful I am that he's planting the seeds that I am good enough and that I deserve to be happy. But - I realized that wasn't what I meant. 

For years professors have told me I'm smart, or that I'm doing a good job. Strangers and friends compliment my appearance or my personality. But those seeds never take root. Any seeds that have been planted haven't been able to grow because my garden is just too dry and uncared for. So I think it's more accurate to say my counselor is watering my garden! :-p He is/ he's helping me make my garden/mind a place where the old and new seeds can take root and grow! :) and I liked that analogy for all of counseling really. Counselors help us make our mind into a healthier place so we can grow confidence, happiness, and everything else we need! :) 

So I made a shirt to remind me to keep working on watering my garden and making my mind a place that fosters all the good I want in my life :) 

Here it is :) I know it's not much but it's the first thing I've drawn, designed, or made into a shirt so it's still pretty cool lol

I would love to help anybody in need of it or just to talk about interesting topics.

happy,"I have awesome college “sisters” and I’m so lucky to have them in my life, especially now","College is hard and that’s a fact :’D I had a really hard time making friends this year due to Covid and such and I spent a lot of time in my room. One day I ran into an acquaintance—we’ll call her Mari—who I met through a club. She asked me if I was going to head to lunch, I said yes, and we ate together. She introduced me to all of her friends, and we had a blast.

I started hanging out with Mari a lot more after that day. I had just fallen out with my old friend group so Mari took me in as her “little sister.” She was really sweet, and I got a lot closer with her, her roommate Cali, and another friend Nation. We spent a lot of time together this semester, eating almost every meal together and hanging out almost every night. Cali and Nation have also adopted me as a “little sister.”

Things at college have been really tense. I don’t want to accidentally turn this into a “silver lining” post so I won’t go into details. But for the whole semester I’ve been having really bad nightmares and hallucinations. I also can never sleep the whole night because my dorm room is close to the front door and people scream like chimpanzees walking in. So Mari and Cali offered to clean up the third bed and let me sleep in their room. I’ve been there for many days since they first offered and it’s helped a lot.

Tonight I had a panic attack. I didn’t want to call my parents or my therapist for whatever reason (ig because I’m tired of depending on them so much?) so I called Mari. She came right over to my room and spent probably an hour with me just hugging me and comforting me as I cried in her arms. She spent another half hour listening to me complain about life and explain what in the world is running through my head. I cried about how I was so scared about losing her and stressing her out and she was so reassuring. Whenever I was highly stressed, my previous friends would say they would always be there for me (spoiler alert: they weren’t). Mari said that as well, but she also added that I deserved friends who could care for me like this at the bare minimum. She said some other comforting things as well which distracted me from the fear of broken promises. And on top of that, she invited me over to her room again so I could focus better on homework and sleep better.

I love these girls so much ;w; I hope I don’t lose them.",Val_Squidson,self.happy,1617767381

I have been overweight for almost my entire life and also unsatisfied with my own height. I was very stressed a year ago and I tried everything to calm myself. Then I started cycling for an hour a day. I live in a countryside and I enjoyed nature a lot. It made me calmed down. I also made some differences to my diet, mostly kicking out fast food. I genuenly started to feel happier. I lost about 40 pounds due to my diet change and cycling. But I was still unsatisfied with my height. During last few months, I noticed that I gained some weight, but I still haven't got any bally fat or muscle mass. Yesterday my gf (who was taller than me) asked me if I grew in height. Then I realised that somehow I became as tall as her. I thought it was because of terrain outside or shoes, but I measured myself today. I grew 2 inches since last year.

happy,My mother in law compared me to Martha Stuart,"Let me give some background I love hosting. I love bringing joy to people. I also love being around friends and not having to leave my home. My MIL (mother in law) normally hosts events, but I hosted Easter with my hubs family yesterday. My MIL is also extremely OCD and a germaphobe. We have a good relationship though (we are very different people though.. her idea of camping is staying in a fully furnished cabin while mine is in a hammock under the stars. She likes glam/modern I like rustic..think chip and Joanne gains.. I live on a small farm while she freaks out at the thought of poop). 

We were all sitting around and idk how it came up but I said I'd like to turn the farm into a wedding venue one day and I even came up with a name ""Oak Grove Farms"" or ""the original OG"" cue chuckles. Apparently MIL didn't know what OG meant so my SIL explained it to her. MIL then said ""oh my goodness, you are not a gangster if anything you're more like Martha Stuart."" 

Y'all I don't achieve to be like Martha Stuart, but my MIL is one of the hardest people to please when it comes to hosting and that was seriously the best compliment she could have ever given me. Of course we then went into the conversation that Martha Stuart and snoop dog are friends and only one of them is a convicted felon but hey.

happy,After over 2 decades of planning my animation dreams have begun!,"Since I was twelve years old, I've had a dream to animate, score, and write a film based on recurring dreams I had as a child. I am now 36. For the past 24 years I have done everything I can to prepare for this goal starting from scratch.  It's been a long road with a lot of great experiences, but then end goal has always been the same. 
     
Here's an overview of the road that has finally lead to my being able to pursue this dream: 

- began playing music at age 12 and went on to study bass in college
- in my early 20s, I got a job at a bank to get a better sense of how funding and costs work
- in my mid-20s, I created [this children's book and read-a-long video](https://youtu.be/SqvKkwU5uxs). The process of creating this was my way of making sure I had what it takes to see a project through to completion. It ended up getting me addicted to projects
- in 2013, I left my finance job for good after getting a book deal drawing mazes (Extreme Mazes, Mindware series).
- I then went on to publish a handful of other maze books as I worked on improving my drawing skills. This also helped me learn how the art/design world works. 
- Also in 2013, I got a lucky break while replying to an online posting. It lead to [this nationally televised set-design/art work](https://youtu.be/M5n0jLf2-Bc). 
- From here I was able to start networking in the Chicago film scene and got a gig as a Stand-in for Chicago PD from Season 2 through Season 5. This helped me really understand what the film production process looks like from the inside. While animation is different in a lot of ways, the overall production process on a tv show set has a lot of overlaps.  
- After this, I wanted to increase my Project Management skills because I knew that any film project will eventually require me to lead a team. So I combined my design/set-work and creative energies and began looking for a fitting PM job. Unfortunately, I couldn't land a job in my target industry (animation), but I did get work in fast-paced, creative based industries (Trade Show &amp; Experiential Marketing). 
- I was able to PM hundreds of projects over the past 4 years, and it taught me a lot about being able to adjust to problems, working with vendors/contractors, setting workback schedules, managing client expectations, etc...
- So last year (2020) I finally saved enough money to build a PC that can handle the 2D and 3D softwares I've wanted to learn for years. While I know Adobe pretty well from work throughout the years, I've never gotten to truly dive into Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya, etc...


And that brings me to today. Earlier this year, I let my current employer know that I planned on leaving in May to begin my animation career in earnest. I've saved up a modest amount of money to hold me over while I dive into learning for 3 months. I've signed up for bootcamps, bought courses, and started testing my skills just to make sure this is what I want to do. 

So... here's why I'm so happy: 

I created these two animations on my new gear. These are my first attempts at animating, and I love the process of making them.      
There's no doubt in my mind that this is what I want to be doing, and I was encouraged to see the results of my first attempts.     
There's a long, long way to go, but my dream can finally begin.

But, an extremely positive lesson a lot of people took out of this challenging period was making the time for practicing mindfulness, prioritizing self-care, and self-improvement. Many people started finding novel ways to live in the moment, find awe in their surroundings, practice loving gratitude, and fit mindful activities into their busy schedules.

happy,I finally got closure on a friendship breakup between me (F15) and my ex best friend (M15),"He ended things at a very odd time. Before that I had been the one who wanted to end things. It was an on and off thing between us. I was glad it happened. Happy even. But then I found out he was talking about me to my brother.. in a not nice way. I was mad and he had blocked me so I had my friend send him a message on my behalf. It was rude and horrible and I regret it right after. 

I couldn’t stop crying about it. I ended up posting about it and came across the most amazing person. She helped me get through it, she made me feel heard. She convinced me to follow through and ask to talk to him one last time. I had my friend ask him if he was comfortable talking for a couple minutes. He said okay, and we talked. A lot. We’re both very happy with how we now left things and I no longer feel sad anymore. 

Before this I felt so betrayed by him and I thought I would never be happy again. I thought I would never be able to trust again. But it was just a good lesson for me. Now I know better and I’m going to keep working on myself. 

Things do get better. If anyone out there is in any pain, just know this is temporary. I went from hopeless and numb to hopeful and relieved. I never thought that would happen. My pain seemed endless. But YOU CAN do it. You WILL get through whatever you’re going through. It may take a day, a week, a month, a year, 5 years, I can’t say for sure. But one day it will be in your past and you’ll look back and laugh and it won’t bother you anymore. 

What I learned: 

- not to depend on other people for my happiness 

- to enjoy my own company 

- to stop caring about what other people think 

- to stop keeping things bottled up inside 

- to listen better and be more patient 

- to communicate my feelings 

- to be fully and unapologetically myself

For so long I’ve isolated myself and folded myself into someone I’m not. I became a shadowy figure in a room full of people. But not anymore. I’m not going to hide. I’m going to be myself and accept what is and what’s not. No more bs. No more settling. I’m going to appreciate every moment. I hope this gives someone out there hope.

happy,I didn't expect a corporation to care about me in this lifetime. My boss proved me wrong.,"I started my new job a few days ago. I was generally happy and peppy until today when my depression crashed down on me and I'm having invasive thoughts so I was super quiet and drowned myself in my music. 

My boss tapped me on my shoulder a few times and asked if I was okay. The first couple times I shrugged it off and said yes but the last time he asked I said no, and he listened to me talk about how I was suicidal. 

He looked at me, genuinely, and said, ""as long as you work while you are on the floor, I don't care if you have to walk to the bathroom and take ten minutes to stare at the wall. If you are having a hard time, you can sit in the break room or your car or the bathroom and just exist and be sad.""

I was kind of shocked and asked if he was sure if it was okay and he nodded, saying, ""we all have things going on and I'm not going to tell you to leave your problems at home. You're a human being and that doesn't work. Just be honest with me.""

I nearly started crying in front of him and he said it was okay if I needed to walk away, so I did. When I'm gone for an extended period of time he glances at me and nods to make sure I'm okay.

happy,My life officially came full-circle today,"My great uncle established my family’s building supply business in 1942, he was an incredible entrepreneur and he opened around 15 successful businesses in his lifetime. Our store was always the most well known though. In 1967 he sold that store to his brother, my grandpa, and ever since then my grandpa &amp; grandma have owned it. My great uncle and my grandpa were both very successful with it and it’s known all over our part of the state because of them. 

Out of my grandparents 4 kids, my dad was the only one that had children. He has a step daughter (my half sister) who he claims as his own, and he has me who is his only biological kid. Since childhood my granny was my babysitter, and when I got old enough to walk and talk I spent every single day at my family’s store. The place has always utterly fascinated me and has been a home away from home for me. I love it there. My girlfriend will tell you that I make excuses just to go there, she thinks it’s hilarious. On Saturday afternoons I go up there and just sit sometimes, Sunday’s before church I always tell her that I gotta go “check on the place”, on days that I have class I go there in between classes just to have an excuse to go. 

I’m recent years though since my grandma is home bound, her children that work there(my aunt and uncle and dad) have not been so successful. They aren’t really business people by nature, and honestly aren’t the friendliest people in the world. Everybody that Im close to, young and old, has said for years “When are you taking that place over? You need to. You’d be good at it.” While I’ve always wanted to be the owner I just never thought it was something that would happen, I just thought it was one of those things that would be a dream that would fall by the wayside. 

Today I informed my 91 year old granny that I was graduating in 14 days (May 7th). She asked me “Where are you going afterwards?”, I responded with “I hope to stay right here in _________.” Then she said “What do you plan on doing?” And as a joke I laughed and said “Well I wish I owned the store!” She looked me dead in the eyes and said “Okay. It’s yours.”

I was floored. 

I had no idea how to respond. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I looked at her and I said “Granny, are you sure??” She explained to me that she was far too old to be dealing with it anymore, and she had been hoping that I would ask her so that she could wash her hands of it. She said that she didn’t know anyone who could fill the role better than me, and she said that she would have my aunt contact the company’s lawyer to get the deed and all of the assets signed over to me within the next couple of weeks. 

So here I am. 20 years old, graduating with a bachelors degree after 3 years of college, and have landed my dream job. My life and my goals have come full circle today. I’m so excited that I can’t hardly contain myself. My girlfriend and all of my best friends are so excited that they all cried with me today individually when I called them and told them. Everyone knows how much I’ve wanted this, and how much I’ve stressed over it and here I am. 

Don’t give up on your dreams folks. You never know when they may jump on you by suprise.",PCundiff1,self.happy,1619140320
happy,First generation American finally feeling like I've made it. I'm still kind of in shock.,"I still need to get it in writing and finalized, but I just received a job offer at a company where I can actually make it into a long term career. I can't even begin to explain how happy I've been since I've received the news this morning. My parents came to America with nothing and have been struggling since. Their business got hit hard with the 2008 recession and are now unfortunately divorced, but both are happy with their current lives. I got my first job as a dishwasher during my sophomore year  in high school and slowly worked my way up to better jobs while I continued on with my associates degree. I was never satisfied with the jobs I obtained, even though each consecutive one payed better. 

At 24 years old I decided to enlist in the military and landed an MOS (job) that was going to expand the technical skills I had. I gave it everything I had during those 4 years and when my contract was up, I got accepted into a University that I had my eye one for a long time. Well now, 2 years into my university education, I got a message on LinkedIn for a position that needed to be filled and was based on the technical skills I developed in the military. 5 days later I had my interview cheat sheet in front of me that I had worked on and was waiting on a zoom call waiting room. The interview went great! better than I had expected! This morning I received an email with an offer at the top of their salary range for the position. Life. Changing. Income. For. Me. 

I was absolutely floored, and when I called the person that helped set up the interview, he said that the interviewers were very impressed with me as a candidate. They said things like ""I can see he's the type of guy that won't stay on my team for too long, because he's going to get moved up very quickly"". 

I am still trying to process all of this even hours later. Honestly I'm a little bit hesitant to tell anyone until I have it in writing. I've told one of my longest best friends and that's it. Putting it into writing right now because I don't want to forget this feeling. It's honestly difficult to contain and as I'm finishing this I'm having to fight off tears.

happy,"Put boundaries in ""my place"" and I love it","2 weeks ago I started therapy and the therapist told me that I wasn't aloud to talk about my mom. Since she is the foundation of most my issues and why I get so stressed easily.

And I took the initiative to stop cleaning after her and  stop making food for her. And I love it!! I usually did cleaning at home all the time and mostly it was her stuff. We are talking about breadcrumbs everywhere and coffee spilled in the stove and microwave. She basicly didn't cleaned and let that for me to clean.

Só now everyone cleans after themselves, including clothes and everyone cooks their own food. Meaning that I no longer have to worry about her crap and if she is fed or not. After all she is an adult like me and should have responsabilities.

And before anyone says ""but she is your mother""... Bu the freaking uh! She made my life a living hell and is an hipócrite and for the 1st time I actually feel joy even if the house is dirty! Why? Cause I do my fair share and if she wants to see it even more clean she better start working around here cause everything that is dirty is from her. Hell this is so great that last week she cleaned the bathroom!! She didn't do it for months and I had to do it every week!

happy,Finally happy for the first time in my life.,"I am finally happy.

After 32 years of living a pretty horrible life. Bad childhood, military out of desperation to get away, sexual assault which I couldn’t report, homeless, jobless, starving, ptsd, depression, broke.

I finally got a good job about a year ago. I’ve since rented a home, gotten a car, buy and cook my own food, shower daily, have 2 amazing dogs, have come out as transgender and started my transition, and everyone at my job is cool with it. 

I’m an extremely hard worker. And I am so happy today because I applied for a higher spot within the company, and I beat two other people. Both with far more time than I have, but my hard work and desire to learn did not go unnoticed by all of my boss people. Discrimination is also a big concern for me. I was somewhat nervous of not being able to get selected for spots because I am transgender, but it isn’t the case. 

Less than 2 years ago I was homeless, working a part-time job to feed myself. Today I am thriving, I am happy.",not-very-straight,self.happy,1619133970

She asks me why
I'm just a hairy guy
I'm hairy noon and night
Hair that's a fright
I'm hairy high and low
Don't ask me why
Don't know
It's not for lack of bread
Like the Grateful Dead
Darling

Gimme head with hair
Long beautiful hair
Shining, gleaming,
Streaming, flaxen, waxen

Give me down to there hair
Shoulder length or longer
Here baby, there mama
Everywhere daddy daddy

Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair

Let it fly in the breeze
And get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas in my hair
A home for fleas
A hive for bees
A nest for birds
There ain't no words
For the beauty, the splendor, the wonder
Of my...

Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair

I want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy
Snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty
Oily, greasy, fleecy
Shining, gleaming, streaming
Flaxen, waxen
Knotted, polka-dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided
Powdered, flowered, and confettied
Bangled, tangled, spangled, and spaghettied!

Oh say can you see
My eyes if you can
Then my hair's too short

Down to here
Down to there
Down to where
It stops by itself

They'll be ga ga at the go go
When they see me in my toga
My toga made of blond
Brilliantined
Biblical hair

My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah I adore it
Hallelujah Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?

Since I was 14 years old I have struggled with depression and thoughts of suicide. Even during times when I wasn't depressed, I thought about killing myself, so I had always sort of figured I wouldn't live past 25. That the regularly resurfacing battle with ending it all would somehow have won.


Yet here I am, 26 years old today. I have some really, really excellent friends who love me and care about me and make effort to show it; I have been able to live out experiences that I never would have dreamed I'd get to do; I have hurt, and I have healed; I have danced with strangers in the rain; I have seen sunrises I will never forget and sunsets that will never fade from my mind; I even saw a total solar eclipse.


The world has so many beautiful things in it, and I can feel that in my heart even when I'm not able to see them. To be alive is the greatest gift I have ever been given, and I'm so thankful that I didn't lose it in a weak moment.

I am a person, who requires alot of structure in my life, so being home all day affected me in a bad and potent way. I've been struggling for over a year to find the structure I needed, and it was very difficult.

I am overweight (although not nearly as big as I used to be) so every class is a struggle. And every night I overcome that struggle through sheer will.  It's given me confidence, purpose, and structure. I've also started to eat well again and getting my diet back on track. 

Last night, I was about to go to sleep when my fiancee said to me ""you're different, somethings different with you somethings better"". I smiled at her, and instantly knew what she meant. I said to her that every day for the past two weeks my body has been beat to hell, and every night I can barely make it into bed cause I'm so exhausted and sore.

happy,I did it. 10 years on the struggle bus and I did it.,"I married my high school sweetheart and had two kids. I was a stay at home mom and had to go back to work. It had been 8 years without working. 

I applied at a place my family banked with and my dad personally asked the branch manager to please give me a chance. She did. 

In that time I stayed relatively single and focused on work and kids. I struggled to pay my bills and collectors called me constantly. I remember having to alway keep my phone face down so I didn’t have to explain the constant calls. Filed for bankruptcy, moved into a small two bedroom apartment where I slept on a couch in our living room to give the kids their space.  I had to put the kids on state insurance and they had to get reduced lunches at school, I didn’t qualify for food stamps, so we ate pizza rolls and ramen noodles and was judged harshly for doing so. As I made more, my ex paid less in child support. I could never get ahead.  People told me my life would get better once I found a man. I was determined to NEVER financially depend on a man as that’s how I got here in the first place. My goal was to never need child support. I would always take it but if my ex decided to not pay a month, it wouldn’t financially devastate me.  He should help financially because they are his children. 

I continued working at the job as a teller, the opening accounts, then sales calling, then underwriting.  Never thinking I was good enough. That this was my life for good. I’d always sleep on a couch, I’d always never have enough, I’d always stress when the kids needed money for school. I’d never be able to find anyone to love because of my shitty situation. I was determined to do better. 

Ten long years and it all worked out. I was even able to buy a house, help my daughter with a car, and I found someone. We’ve been together for about 3 years. 

I recently accepted a position at a new place making what I call “life changing” money. It’s not that much to most people, but for me, it’s a lot more than what I was making at the original place that I worked at for 10 years. I realize now, maybe they were taking advantage of me. 

I did it. 

Trust me, I have had help here and there. My dad bought me a car, friends gave me very generous gift cards at Christmas, coworkers on more than one occasion bought my kids gifts, my daughter’s Girl Scout troop waived fees or the leader just paid out of her own pocket. One friend took me to Target once and said “Buy whatever you need”.   And just let me get literally whatever I needed.  Online friends sent me money out of the blue, little gift cards to Starbucks so I could treat myself.  I am forever grateful for the help. 

Telling my friends and family and have them get emotional for me, i think my boyfriend is getting the scope of It all. They’ve seen me try so hard and they are just so happy for me. My boyfriend is too, but he wasn’t there for the really hard years. The years where I prayed each morning that my car would start. The frantic feeling I would get at the beginning of the month, wondering if this was the month my ex didn’t want to pay child support and I wouldn’t be able to make rent.  Using my tax refund to supplement my income, using it for car repairs and unexpected emergencies. Good years, I could make it stretch. Bad years, I was fucked by August.  

I’ve been crying all weekend from happiness an last gratitude.",midner1116,self.happy,1579442552

happy,"By some insane sand unimaginable twist of events, things somehow got better","Around this time two years ago, I was in a profoundly dark place, gaining weight, drinking myself to sleep every night, working like a dog for $10 an hour and failing most of my classes in a shitty community college that I went to after having a nervous breakdown at my original university. I was regularly thinking about hurting myself and in May, 2018, I drove about an hour north in the early morning to a hiking trail I used to frequent. There was a large cliff there with a drop of at least 100 feet and I was determined to step into thin air and the oblivion that would come with it. I sat there for about twenty minutes, cried, and looped back to my car, drove an hour back home, changed, and apologized to my boss for being late to work.

Today I’m sitting in my house marveling at how lucky I was to not do it. In the time since then, I found my vocation was cooking, and I got pretty damn good at it. I went to culinary school for two semesters and aced every course. I landed a job in a renowned restaurant group and three weeks ago was transferred to their flagship restaurant in New York, where I’m training to help open a new one in South Beach, Miami. I’m making better money than ever before and am finally feeling myself have some control over my life. 

I’m overwhelmed with joy, happy to be alive, and frankly feel like the luckiest fucker to ever walk the earth.",jwal245,self.happy,1579374462

“For you to disrespect a girl who I am very close to by calling her a name is disgusting and I would never stand by and let anyone talk about someone I am close to like that. You don’t even know her so how can you even comment? It’s okay... she’s a strong girl with thick skin and friends who will do anything for her and your comments won’t phase her but you might want to think before you speak because you’re the one who has to live with the hate you spread.” 

Idk that just warmed my heart and made me feel so special, loved, and cared for which is amazing because I don’t feel that way often. I’m so thankful to have someone like him in my life, I don’t know what I did to deserve him. He makes me feel so important and happy.  Some people might be like “He’s your boyfriend, he’s supposed to that” and I know that but I’m just not used to being loved and the way he worded it was so adorable.

I was physically and mentally disabled by panic-- I had 7 emergency room visits in two months, only to be given a clean bill of health. It was all in my head! So, I have been working on it. Since my last (and final) panic ER visit, I've forced myself to go out and get back to work. I made half a dozen artworks I'm really proud of, got one in a show, started dating a pretty woman (it's going excellent), started lifting weights and running, eating better, sleeping better, speaking my mind, going to therapy, and had an amazing holiday with my friends and family where I wasn't afraid. My panic is much less present, and when it is I am not so afraid. This new year rules, and it's all because of what I did, and continue to do for myself. Art school starts up again next week and I just can't wait to see my friends, make even better work, and learn as much as I can! Life is so beautiful.

happy,Got into my top choice college and am feeling quite grateful. It feels really good to see when someone else is genuinely happy for you.,"The past few hours have been a blur. For the first time in years, I truly feel proud of something. I’ve struggled with self-esteem issues and mental illnesses since I was young, and they’ve been bad for the past month or so. Despite my emotions still feeling muted and everything feeling unreal, I think this is the happiest I’ve felt probably all year. 

I also felt so so grateful to my family for being so supportive. The first person I called was my mom, and she was so excited. Then I texted my sister, and she video called me right away (she’s abroad right now) and told me my mom had called her crying to let her know. She told me she was proud of me and let me know I was going with an almost full ride (I’d looked over the financial package already but had misinterpreted it). 

My family decided to go out to dinner to celebrate and I felt really giddy. My parents kept telling me how proud they were and told me they knew I could do it. It really meant a lot because my dad was slightly emotionally abusive in the past which contributed to my mental health problems (as was my sister).

Then I called my grandparents in Korea. They were beyond happy and my paternal grandparents said they’d pay for my tuition and everything. I called my maternal grandma afterwards, and she was pretty calm but I could tell she was excited. She told me she hadn’t called in a while because she didn’t want to interrupt my studies, and something else that really touched me was that she said she’d been “praying for me even though our religions our different”.

happy,My third graders just surprised me with the sweetest Christmas gifts ever! Probably the nicest thing anyone has done for me in years...,"Third grade teacher (age 8-9) here, English isn't my first language so please be nice about mistakes:

My class surprised me with the cutest little presents ever today and I have been tearing up all day since. 
For the long weeks waiting for Christmas we organized a secret santa  in our class with little gifts. As their teacher I did not participate in this little gift exchange. After last monday's PE class, which was so much fun (building human pyramids and practicing the flying role) the kids left the gym happy as nails. I could hear the girls talking behind my back and being kinda sneaky. Everybody was glowing...it just was so cool to see. 


Well fast forward to today this morning and I see a couple of my students bunched up and again being really sneaky and suspicious. They gave me a sly smile and told me to go away. 

When we started class I knew something was up. We always start our school day by forming a big circle, holding hands and lightly squeezing the hand of the person next to us. After that little ritual the kids told me I had to leave the classroom real quick. I obliged and after hearing a lot of yelling and fighting they apparently settled everything and called me back inside. They formed a little half circle, put my chair in front of that and told me to sit down. 

First they recited a poem they had written for me, then they handed me a bag with all sorts of gifts. They gave me hand written christmas cards, poems, hand drawn pictures, cookies, candy, a new red pen and all sorts of just super sweet gifts (one picture was titled ""The best present is having you"", that one killed me). They were absolutely radiating and I had to summon all my willpower to not cry right there in front of them.  You could tell this was all organized by them, their parents hardly had any input (though they told me they forced their parents to coordinate via their class whatsapp group chat).

I was lost for words looking at them. I'm under a lot of work related stress and that moment of having those 26 brats just smiling at me put all of that into perspective. 
I became a teacher, because I want to have a postive impact on kids who may not have gotten the best start to life. My dad left my family when I was young and having a strong, male teacher take care of me when I was younger really helped me through a lot, even if I did not realize it at the time. I hope to be somewhat like that for others now and just getting this feedback showed me I might be on the right track.

I was also working a horrible retail job that I absolutely hated, and felt very lost in life. Going onto Reddit, reading stories from other subreddits, and honestly just having people, whoever they may be, listening to my sorrows helped me get through my depression during that time in my life.

happy,My therapist is really cool and is the first to really work with me,"Idk y’all it took me a long time to find a therapist that works with me.
What specifically makes me say this, is I’m starting the winter semester next month. It’s an intensive, 20 day semester with no breaks (except weekends I think). It’s so fast paced that it’s recommended you only take one class if you do the winter semester. I’m doing it with my favorite professor, but she’s very strict and really challenges her students, so I just gave me therapist a heads up that I may not be able to do weekly therapy.
He told me it’s no big deal, he said he’ll waive cancellation fees during that semester (so if I need to last-minute cancel because of class or projects, it’s not a huge deal) and he said he can do shorter phone call check ins with me in the evening if I can’t make it to actual therapy.
Also, while I was in day hospital, he did phone call therapy sessions with me in the evenings.
He’s also super understanding of my transition and isn’t judgmental of my goals (I’ve had therapists judge me in the past for not wanting any more surgeries or being more androgynous).
I’m just so happy I found him and can work with him.",mewiodas,self.happy,1576003702

Just an open invite to about 30 people as I suck at gauging friendship levels. 17 people showed up not including myself. That is a moment you can’t recreate. I don’t even have words to explain how ecstatic I was to have these people come from over an hour away just to see my dumb face. That is a prescription a doctor can’t prescribe. I wish I could convey to my friends how much it meant to me.",atomic_bobomb,self.happy,1575829796
happy,"I thought I would be dead by now, but I just turned 30 and could never be happier!","I wanted to kill myself at least once a year. I tried. I even told my mom just four years ago that I wish I had never been born. I have made two solid attempts. Hospitalized for three days afterwards and recommended to try drugs for my PTSD. This was the first PTSD diagnosis ever. This year I have had so many more suicidal thoughts. Probably more than I have had in any year of my life because of a lot of psychological trauma that happened. But, last night just made me so mad at myself.

I got there at 6:45pm with my boyfriend. Not 20 minutes later the first person showed up. Then shortly afterward the second. Then a third and forth. Then a fifth and sixth. Then a seventh. Eighth. The number kept climbing higher and higher. I told the venue I didn’t expect many people, maybe 10 at most. They, of course, gave away my reservation to another table despite being 15 minutes early which we weren’t aware of so we sat down at the large table that had a “reserved” sign on it. (I don’t fault them for that because mixups happen)

The staff came over after realizing they gave away my table and asked us to move because the table we sat at was for a group of 15. Not only did 15 people not show up, but I ended up having 17 people there at one time excluding myself. I felt a little good about that because I honestly didn’t expect that many people to begin with and clearly neither did the establishment. It was all good though because they were really kind at accommodating us and shit happens. But, wow. That moment when you have all these people there just to see you. Just me. That hit me really hard in the heart. Those people made the effort. 

I am honestly so overwhelmed with emotion and all of it is actually positive for once. I didn’t think I would make it this far, but I am sure glad I did.",atomic_bobomb,self.happy,1575826189
happy,Cried tears of joy yesterday because of him,"I was in a toxic and controlling relationship for 2 and a half years before I had the balls to leave him. He was so emotionally abusive. I’m grateful he never laid a hand on me, but his words did enough to leave some emotional damage. 
He absolutely hated alcohol. 
I’m not much of a big drinker but I do like my occasional night out on the town and some bar hopping. Every time I drank he would make me feel like absolute shit. And shun me. Call me names, druggie, alcoholic, and much worse. pair that up with a hangover and you have yourself some serious fml feelings. 

Anyways, I left him 6 months ago. And 6 months ago I met H. 

H had a company work party this past weekend, and I made the mistake of drinking on a nearly empty stomach.  I had rushed to the ceremony from my job so I didn’t miss the awards. 
I was so hungover, puking from 9 am until 3 pm. And H was there for me. He rubbed my back. He went out for a food run and smoothie run and made sure I had every hangover remedy ready at his bedside for me. He told me everything was gonna be okay, and he didn’t shun me for getting too drunk and causing my own miserable hangover. He didn’t scold me and make me feel shitty for being dumb by not eating a nice meal before drinking. He knew I knew it myself and he just wanted me to feel better. That’s all he cared about. I’m just so grateful to get to experience what it’s like to be with someone who actually loves and cares for you. So yesterday, I cried while he wasn’t looking because I just couldn’t stop thinking about how wonderful this feeling is and how wonderful he is, and after the couple years I just wasted being with someone who made me feel like shit every day, I cried of happiness for myself, because I truly deserve this and I’ll never settle for anything less.",ahoopaloop,self.happy,1575825993

But I'm starting this new chapter where I want to be more happy and completely different from my past self. After struggling with depression and anxiety all my life, I felt hopeless,  inadequate and just stagnant with the things I was doing. I'm getting older this year and I want to choose happiness, self love and affirmations in this next chapter. A year and a half ago I started this podcast called ""One Time For A Good Time"" talking about the insecurities and hardships the everyday person goes through. I didn't think anything would come from it,  I just wanted to create a platform and put myself out there but over the years everything became therapeutic for me. I began to pour my heart out, get listeners and eventually I would get emails from people expressing how I saved their life in some way. It was amazing seeing the difference I brought into the world.  So many of us has been going through rough times recently and I think it's important that we have communities where we can build together and just focus on getting on the right path. I don't know if anyone is interested but here's my podcast,  I hope we together can go through 2022 trying to make ourselves feel a little bit better 🥰🥰🥰 if you've gotten this far in the post, I really just want to say I love you and thank you so much for hearing me out.

happy,"My Relationship finally had gotten better! Big City, New Job, First Apartment and Happy!","It’s been a while.

It’s been at least a year since things have genuinely changed, about 3/4 years since almost all my old friends have moved on in life. All while my boyfriend of 3 years (4 this November)and I grew up.

There have been days, weeks, and even months where I thought I was a complete failure, in anything I did. But now, I have a full time job. And i signed an NDA , but it’s the easiest, laziest job in the world at that. Just checking and record keeping. I won! 


My relationship is wonderful, my long term boyfriend and I just got out first apartment together this year, smack in the middle of Center City Philadelphia. I’m getting an education again, while my partner kisses my forehead every night and loves to sit down and just vibe with me everyday. We go to the movies, play video games, cat nap and just go take walks. There was a time when I never thought him and I would make it. Not alone living in the city. A time when I thought arguments meant it was over, and he’d shut down before I could even notice something was off. 

We both are getting mental help now, and last night we discussed the possibility of getting married by the end of this year. It’ll be four years. Four fucking crazy ass years of being with him. Four years of learning everything about one another, and learning what real communication looks like. 

My mother doesn’t like him because she’s in denial that I don’t need her anymore. His mother doesn’t like me, because she wants him for herself. And they’ve admitted (by accident) it was because of jealousy. It only made us realize we will never be supported, no matter how well we’re doing. 
And neither of us speak to our fathers anymore, but last we decided we’re going to try and work on that too. 

We didn’t realize how independent we’ve been from everything we used to know and follow. In our minds, we’re still 16 and walking on eggshells. But we’re both 22 now, full time jobs, getting whatever we want and coming back home to just one another every night. 

Now our families ask US for help. Now suddenly we get the random “I love and miss you” messages and calls and “we’re so proud of you both.” 

I have the job that I want, and work for the government at that. And our savings are steadily growing at the perfect rate. Either this year, or in two years, we may start our own business. We aren’t in a rush, we are stable and just want to make sure we have more money before we start having children. And what’s crazy, is that I’d never thought I’d hear my mom say it, but Im doing so well in life for my age, she even said if I had a baby, she knew I could provide everything for my child despite my age. The fact that I’d just be a “young mom” and not a naive one/ignorant one, really made me forgive my mom. What’s crazier, is that I make more money than my parents now, without a college degree.

I cried and did everything I could to get this job and make this kind of money. Im literally sitting in an office for 6 out of the 8 hours of real work. Im beyond blessed. And the fact my partner just wants to invest in our savings / and have fun with it while he pays for all of our bills makes me want to cry randomly at times too. He knows I fully have his back, and he confided in me last night that the reason his parents marriage had failed, was because his mother left everything for the father to handle, and his father snapped. And he said from the beginning of our relationship, he knew I was a hard worker, but didn’t appreciate it enough because he thought what his father went through would be repeated with me. We had a moment in 2021 where I told him he could happily fuck off and I immediately just went back to work, and he said he realized he just had a lot of pent up fears and mommy issues to work on. And when he went to talk to his mother about it, and how serious he was to make it work with me, she cursed my name and lied saying I tried to fight her and screamed at her. I’ve only seen this woman twice. He called her out and she hung up on him. It’s been…. A ride.

But We’re young and make good money Our savings are beautiful. We’re slowly trying to make friends again, and planning for a business/ family in the next few years. 

I miss our old friends, but even now I have to accept they didn’t want anything to do with me, they just wanted the benefits of having me around. Same as my family. 

I really hope my next update is about my engagement, or our baby being on the way.

happy,"Yay!! Busch Gardens, Spring Break and getting out of town finally.","I know everyone’s been down and out with Covid and things being shut down and just blah!! I’m nervous as hell that we’re gonna get Covid and my son has terrible asthma BUT… I’m also sick of worrying. I over worry and overthink all the time as it is, constantly.  My happy moment right now is that I just bought two tickets to Busch Gardens for March and I just also booked two nights at a hotel basically across the street from the park. My son is going to be soooo excited! He is 11, his birthday is in April and of course with Covid, he has not had a birthday party, we have not gone and done anything at all in a couple of years. I go to work, he goes to school and we come home and that is it. I can’t even tell you the last time I drove out of our hometown here. Geez that’s sad! This is an early Birthday present for him and just a YAY moment for myself. We need to get away. Go have fun. He’s never been to a park like this well when he was little and can’t even remember but man this little dude of mine better love roller coasters. Haha! He’ll be standing along while I ride ;)  I’m so super excited. He has no idea but I may go ahead and tell him when I pick him up from school. We’ll be going to the park for one whole day and staying two nights and will find other things to do but oh man he’s gonna be so stoked. He’s a kind, loving, funny as hell, respectful kid and definitely deserves to get out and have some fun. I’m so excited lol. I may even splurge a little extra for the passes to skip to the front of the line 😊 The only thing I am not liking at all and I really should’ve thought to check this before I paid for everything, the park hours are now from 3 PM until 9 PM. Wtf!?!? I remember getting there at 10 or 11 o’clock in the morning right when the gates opened and staying until 10 or 11 o’clock at night. That’s not cool at all especially for the money. So maybe those extra tickets would be worth it to at least be able to ride everything at least once. Sometimes these lines are two hours long and the park is only open six hours!? Blah!!

happy,Things are going right - and I made a friend.,"This is so weird, but I’m so so happy right now. And I kinda just wanna write about it so I can come back later and read it again. To start, I’m 33M, gay, and happily partnered. 

About a year and a half ago, I started trying to actively lose weight. Long story short, after calorie counting and portion control I lost about 100lbs. I’m now down to 175lbs. I feel great, I look good for the first time in my life, and I’m feeling more confident. 

I’m a full time grad student. I’ve wanted to get my higher degree for about 10 years now and I’m finally doing it. The only problem with this is that it’s very difficult to make friends. Not only is making friends as an adult kind of awkward, being a grad student means I have virtually no time for “fun,” and my only conversation topics are school related. 

One of the guys in my department and I got to talking yesterday and the subject moved to weight loss and fitness. He’s an army guy so fitness is something he’s pretty familiar with. I mentioned to him that after my weigh loss, I’m wanting to start lifting weights and bulk up a little. Nothing crazy, but losing 100lbs in your 30s means skin doesn’t spring back as fast, and so adding some weight lifting can help. He was so kind. He offered to help me get started! And I know this all seems very bro-y and superficial, but for me this is really big. Growing up I was the fat shiny fem gay kid with no friends at all. So the fact that this guy, this straight macho army guy, extended the offer to me to hang out and help me get closer to my fitness goals is ridiculously confidence boosting. I think what it is, is that I have superficially stereotyped army guys in my mind. Alpha. Bro. Slightly to moderately homophobic. But this guy challenged my assumptions and I’m glad to know him. I’m glad that I found a friend that I can talk about school stuff with *and* who can help me with weight lifting, *and* that he extended the offer first. It lets me know that he wants to be my friend too, and that my personality isn’t repulsive. 

Gah making friends as an adult is weird. But rewarding.",Nam3Tak3n33,self.happy,1643826061
happy,I am so proud of my daughter and her husband.,"My son in law owns his own company and they decided to out source some of the telephone work to another country. 

Instead of giving people the minimum wage amounts where they are living they decided to pay a bit more than the minimum wage of our country (14.50 an hr) which is a LOT higher than most wages where the workers are from. 

Its terrible when companies pay other countries crap wages to save some money and the fact that my daughter and son in law are paying 16.00 an hr vs the approx 3.50 usd that the workers would be getting will greatly benefit themselves and their families.

happy,My world is so much fuller with people who love me than I could've ever expected (bonus pic of adorable dog included),"A few days ago in a moment of crisis, I nearly made a permanent choice to a temporary situation. It's so strange to think about now, I didn't even recognize who I was was at the time-- it was practically an out of body experience. The one person who I had thought would always have my back if I ever found myself in this situation couldn't help me and wasn't able to for a few reasons. Anyhow, for the last year or so, I've largely viewed myself as being alone on this spinning rock of seven billion people and I sure as hell was convinced of it at the moment. One call with someone I hadn't talked to in nearly half a year stopped me from committing the irreversible.

From that moment on and since then, there has been someone there for me, to support me. First, there was my younger sister, who I've had a strained relationship the past few years. She told me she loved me and has been talking/ messaging me since. An aunt who I never in a million years would've expected to care came and got me. Her with two of her friends on vacation talked with me, listened for hours to everything I had to say. They fed me, gave me clarity on a lot and supported me in ways I never would've expected from anyone. The aunt gave me her number and told me to message her if I ever needed anything. My dad has been calling me almost every day and he said he'd be there in any way I needed him to. My mom hugged me and we cried. She too has been giving me a lot of advice and talking to me about a lot of things.

Beyond them, so many other people as well have reached out to me-- business associates, old friends, family distant and close, and even acquaintances. My email and phones have had so many notifications from all of them. It's blown my mind how many people care about my well being. The past few years, I've focused so much of my time and energy into building my profession and businesses, traveling, putting my love for what I do above everything else, even my own well being and time spent with others. It got to the point where everyone around me was just like a blimp in the past paced rhythm of my life. I had met a girl and she was the only constant for most of the last nine months.

There are so many things I would've missed out on if it hadn't been for the support I received and it's been weighing heavily on my mind. I wouldn't have been able to pet my cat or take my dog on another walk. My family would've been devastated. I would've never able again to watch another sunset or feel the wind on my skin while driving with the windows down. I would've never been able to get a second master's degree, take another great picture (I'm a pro photog), travel any more or meet any more terrific people. I would've never gotten to buy a house, settle down, meet and marry a wife one day, or even have kids.

I am just so glad I am still here, still alive. Rumi said, ""The would is the place where the light enters,"" and now I can see that so clearly. I never knew or imagined I mattered so much to so many people. I have so much relief that I am still here, still alive. You really never know who will actually be there to support you when push comes to shove. Even now, I am just looking out the window as I write this, looking at the ocean and the clouds, and I am realizing how beautiful of a day it is. I am truly am grateful to be apart of it. I'm committed now to bettering myself in my deficits, am getting the help I need, and I am going to make the most of this opportunity to still be here.

I will not make the same near mistake again. Also, for the hell of it, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesome/comments/omhi76/my_dögs_response_to_hearing_the_word_walk/) is a bonus video of my beloved dog.

So many other people as well have reached out to me-- business associates, old friends, family distant and close and even acquaintances. My email and phones have been blowing up with notifications. It's blown my mind how many people care about my well being. The past few years, I've focused so much of my time and energy into building my profession and businesses, traveling, putting my love for what I do above everything else, even my own well being. It got to the point where everyone around me was just like a blimp in the past paced rhythm of my life. I had met a girl and she was the only constant for most of the last nine months.

There are so many things I would've missed out on if it hadn't been for the support I received and it's been weighing heavily on my mind. I wouldn't have been able to pet my cat or take my dog on another walk. My family would've been devastated. I would've never able again to watch another sunset or feel the wind on my skin while driving with the windows down. I would've never been able to get a second master's degree, take another great picture (I'm a pro photog), travel any more or meet any more terrific people. I would've never gotten to buy a house, settle down, meet and marry a wife one day, or even have kids.

So many things and possibilities I would've missed out on. I am just so glad I am still here, still alive. Rumi said, ""The would is the place where the light enters,"" and now I can see that so clearly. I never knew or imagined I mattered so much to so many people. I have so much relief that I am still here, still alive. You really never know who will actually be there to support you when push comes to shove. Even now, I am just looking out the window as I write this, looking at the ocean and the clouds, and I am realizing how beautiful of a day it is. I am truly am grateful to be apart of it. I'm committed now to bettering myself in my deficits, am getting the help I need, and I am going to make the most of this opportunity to still be here.

I will not make the same near mistake again. Also, for the hell of it, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesome/comments/omhi76/my_dögs_response_to_hearing_the_word_walk/) is a bonus video of my beloved dog.

happy,"I'm a teenager with crohn's, and I want to inspire and motivate you to life the happiest life you can","Hi! How are you?

I'm Cherry. I have crohn's disease and OCD, and this past year has been extremely tough for me. I was behind in school because of my condition, incredibly stressed and ill, and struggling with personal issues.

I decided months ago that I would push my limits, take care of myself to the best of my ability, and be the kind of person that I can be proud of.

With that goal in mind, I grew mindful of my diet, my exercise, my mental wellbeing, my hobbies. I began to read for pleasure and relax in ways other than using my phone.

I even got a part time job at a restaurant, which I love. I feel fulfilled and happy because I know I deserve to, and you know you do too. These things are tough to accomplish, but nothing is impossible if you start small and let it become a habit.

You don't ever have to reach every single goal every day. It's enough if you only reach one. But you'll notice, that in the end, you'll have accomplished something every day, even if it's small, and that's something to be proud of.

You deserve to feel proud and fulfilled. So let's do this together. Let's study, work on our health and fitness, on our mental wellbeing and calm, on our hobbies and goals and aspirations. I'm still working on it- but it's progress. And just in case you needed to hear this, I want to put it out there.

Don't ever let anything stop you- put yourself first. Now is the time to do all those things you wanted to do.

Excuses will always be excuses- it's time to live life to the fullest, because tomorrow is the first day of the future life that you aspire to have.",-INKGHOST-,self.happy,1626470378

happy,After years finally the dark clouds are beginning to disappear and improvement is in sight,"I was in a very bad mood for years. Sometimes I was sitting in my bed and I wasn’t feeling anything. My whole body was feeling empty. There were dark clouds in my head that just wouldn’t go away. Thoughts that I was not good enough for my loved people. Thoughts of that I wont get back to a happy life.
Over time I tried so many things to eliminate my dark clouds. From pills to treatments to reading books I tried everything to get back to a happier life.
After months of research I found this app and I have to say that I never thought that an app would help me to living a happier life. The first task puts me in a hopeful mood and it is finally getting better and better everyday.
I am so grateful to see that my dark clouds are moving away and hope that everyone who reads this will also stick to his goal for living a happier life. There is hope.",superiorOryx5433,self.happy,1639064560

I wasn’t allowed any breaks, couldn’t drink water and wasn’t allowed to sit down. I was bullied so much. (My boyfriend at the time also broke up with me via text on our 1 year.) Wasn’t paid for 2 months. When I finally got paid. I left and moved back home. I became depressed and developed severe anorexia and sleep insomnia. But I didn’t want to give up on myself. Today I had an interview for my number once choice job and I got it there and then. I feel happier. I have a purpose in life. I’m now focusing to fix my eating/sleep disorder.

happy,"2 years clean from alcohol, cocaine, weed, pills, booze, self harm, and basically everything but coffee.","Edit: I just realized I put alcohol in the title twice, which is honestly pretty fitting because alcohol was my DOC lol 

Anonymity makes talking about difficult topics so much easier. Stigmas, fear of judgement, shame, guilt, grief… these all play a part in how open I am willing to be about the topic I’m going to talk about today. So please be kind and know this is not easy for me. I haven’t been able to say all of this to the people I actually know in my life, although many of them already know or suspect that I’m a recovering addict. 

Two years ago, I was lost and spiraling out of control. I somehow managed to allow myself to be completely consumed by pain, sadness, and grief, and I hid behind vices so that I wouldn’t have to face any of it. I wanted everything to just… stop. I had so much going for me but I couldn’t see any of it.

I’ll spare the details because they are ugly. Anyone who knew me back then would know what I’m talking about. Those who didn’t know me should consider themselves lucky - I was a completely different person. I was self-centered, impulsive, unpredictable, careless, and completely lacked motivation and drive in life. I wanted to be left alone so that no one would have to watch me circle the drain. I pushed everyone away and sabotaged everything that I had. I wasn’t living, I was merely coping, and every day was exactly the same – like Groundhog Day – because I wasn’t willing to change. I was giving up.

I really can’t tell you exactly what happened to me two years ago today. Several things were going wrong back then, but they had been going wrong for a while. It wasn’t exactly a new or unexpected crisis, it wasn’t a legal scare, or a grand “epiphany.” I woke up December 8th, 2019, hungover and pissed off at myself for the 5000th time. I poured all the alcohol in my house down the drain, flushed my drugs down the toilet, took a good look in the mirror, and decided that I had done enough damage to my life. I knew that if I wasn’t going to change at *that* moment, then I wasn’t going to change at all, and if I didn’t make a change in my life, then I wasn’t going to survive for much longer. So, I took that moment and I turned it into 24 hours. I turned 24 hours into seven days, and then a month, six months…. It got easier and easier after a while, and here I am two years later, still holding onto that.

This isn’t easy to talk about – not for me, not for anyone – but it should be. It’s so easy to feel embarrassed, guilty, sad, and hurt, but it will consume you if you let it. I can’t tell you how much my life has changed for the better since I decided to start living again. Happy to be here",butterflyfrenchfry,self.happy,1638943026

The app uses a sentiment analysis AI to filter out the negativity and only show news that is uplifting.

happy,I developed a mental health related app from my personal experience,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I was having social anxiety and I was isolating myself, sometimes even from my kids and family. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

happy,A short letter I wrote to my adoptive mom last year for Mother’s Day,"So I had stopped seeing a therapist by this point after what happened with my previous foster parents, and about everything else in my life to this point. I was honestly in a good place and still am, so I figured I’d write her something just talking about everything. I will mention that, because of my dyslexia, I had to type it out first and make sure there weren’t any spelling errors and then hand-write it, which I gave to her. So here it is:

Hi Mom,

I’ll try and make this short and sweet, but it probably won’t be. I just wanted to say thank you, you and dad. For everything you’ve done for me and keep doing for me. I can’t thank you enough. Truly. But I also wanted to say I’m sorry. Mainly for how I was in the beginning when you first took me in. I said and did some things that I shouldn’t have at all. I still regret saying them to this day. But, if I’m being completely honest, it was just because I was scared. Scared and angry. Scared mainly because I didn’t want things to turn out how they did with my previous foster parents. And angry for a reason you might not think. It wasn’t because of my previous foster mom. No, it was because of how much you reminded me so much of my actual mom. 

I know that sounds weird but I was still so mad at the world for losing her that it felt like fate was torturing me by having someone in my life who was just like her. That was the main reason I had that hostility. But all of that would change the night it happened. My panic attack. When I called out for my actual mom to come help me and you burst in thinking I was calling for you. You wrapped me in your arms like a warm blanket and I legitimately thought for a moment my actual mom had come back but I looked again and saw you. It was the feeling of being so safe and comfortable in your arms that made me understand she was gone but that someone equally as caring and loving was right next to me this whole time. All those mean things I said to you went out the window when you heard me yelling. It didn’t even take a second thought for you. 

I’m sorry again for everything, but just know that I love you so much. You and dad. You guys really are the best thing to ever happen to me. I mean it. You gave me meaning and purpose in my life again. I don’t know where I’d be today without you both. But I know that wherever my birth mom is, she’s probably smiling knowing her daughter’s in safe hands.

Love,

Cecilia

Absolutely love it, it really relaxes me and I'm normally quite a ADD type of person and really struggle to relax and concentrate. The breathing parts are quite chill but really effective.

I really like all of their videos, their channel has got quite a few different ones, like this short one to regain calm and clarity.

My partner went over and picked her up like a baby and she snuggled into his arms, resting her head on his shoulder. When he went to put her down she asked him not to because it felt so good. 

She sees him as a dad and that's the first time a dad has picked her up and held her with love, security and protection in her life. She had my dad growing up but its not the same.

happy,My new friend from my job cheers me up instantly and makes my entire day.,"I met this guy at my new job who I am becoming friends with and he is a freaking awesome person. It's almost like he just fell into my life out of nowhere. I was pretty lonely and wanting to make friends, only to find out he and I have so many things in common it's insane. Every time I feel stressed out, down, or sad about something, he instantly cheers me up just by talking to me. He is so profound, thoughtful, intelligent, kind, and genuine. He is incredibly talented, a good listener, and not judgemental.

He makes me feel like I can be my weird, dorky self around him and not get treated differently. I kinda opened up to him about some things I never felt comfortable opening up to about anyone before - that's how much I trust him and feel comfortable around him. There are so many interesting things about him, every time I am scheduled to work I'm excited just to get to know more about him. I have never had such a person in my life ever before. I am actually almost afraid of completely messing it up somehow. When I get nervous I kind of act weird and he makes me nervous but that's just because I don't have much experience talking to new people. But I am breaking out of my shell. I just need to try not to be too intense. But he makes me so happy.",thelongestbootstraps,self.happy,1640166699

happy,Probably my best practice session for trumpet yet!,"So for context, I'm learning trumpet for the upper-level jazz band this next semester. I've played flute since middle school, tenor sax since freshman year of high school, and now I'm finally getting a chance to play brass in a formal ensemble. Switching between instrument families (i.e. woodwind to brass) is harder than switching within a family (i.e. clarinet to sax). As a woodwind native, I've been struggling a lot with trumpet, especially range and general embouchure endurance. Today, I had a really good practice session. Decent tone, didn't have the car-buzz sound nearly as much as other days, and I was able to hit the C and D in the staff, even at the end of the session (previously, I could only play them at the beginning, then suffer major embouchure fatigue by the end of the ~30 minute practice session). I read through some old music and was able to play mostly in the octave it was written, instead of taking it down, like I had been doing recently. Maybe it's harder for non-musicians to understand, but it's really satisfying to feel like I'm actually making progress!!",ecarstairs,self.happy,1640138703

happy,My Aunt and Uncle are such a great couple,"A few years ago my uncle became determined to find love and unfortunately fell into a rushed marriage with a woman who used him for his money, drove him bankrupt, and left him for another man. Everyone in the family was very sad to see this as all he wanted was a caring relationship and to settle down and raise a family. It seemed really important to him and like something he really wanted to do and experience and I've never judged him for wanting that. He has a fun-loving and goofy personality and I could see him being a happy husband to someone. Then he met my now aunt and it was just magic. She and I got along quickly and then after a while, the two got engaged. She was extremely nice to the family and seemed well-intentioned and genuine. While engaged she discovered her happy accident, that she was pregnant with my new baby cousin. The family overwhelmingly welcomed the new baby, excited for them as they were already planning to be married and form a family of their own, and the timing seemed perfect. The baby was born and he is beautiful. Adorable. Just so sweet. It was a real Pam and Jim moment where no one saw this baby coming but the couple was just about ready for it and it was perfect. They're still married and generally very happy. I see them at every party and my uncle loves his son so much and his wife. It was as if everything went wrong before a family and the life he wanted fell into his lap. I'd never seen a happy accident pregnancy before and the joy was overwhelming. Every time I see my uncle, my cousin, or my aunt on social media I'm filled with second-hand happiness. They love their little family and seeing the happy ending I've never gotten to see before, makes me so happy too.",AnonPinkLady,self.happy,1640108483

happy,"I'm in love, I'm in love, and I don't care who knows it!","I am in love with a friend of mine. We met in 2018. We were just acquaintances who saw each other every so often. We'd go months without speaking and then we'd cross paths and catch up until the next time. 
In 2018 I was still invested in my 13 year marriage. In early 2020 My husband started questioning/discovering/realizing his sexuality and it was very difficult to move past that for me. Among the other intimacy and boundary issues we had experienced, that was the straw that broke the camels back. We separated in October of 2020 and we are now divorced. We are friendly and effectively coparenting our two boys ages 9 and 11. It’s a challenge but so far we’re doing alright. He is in his 2nd relationship since our separation. This time he’s sure he’ll marry this one. 
During my separation I got closer to a dear friend of mine and we have been romantically involved since my separation and have been officially in a relationship since August 2021.  He is a divorced (no kids) veteran (33M), has ptsd, winning his battle with bulimia, and 5 years clean from pills. He is a good man. Just a real gem.

He has been such a blessing in my life. He just fits. My kids enjoy him. He enjoys my kids. He does things with them, he has conversations with them, he does things for them.. all without being asked to. He treats them with respect. They respect him, they like him, they want him around. 
He is so good to me too. He respects me, he tries to understand me, he tries his best to give me what I need. We are both in a place of growth and healing and progressing. In the time he has spent with me so far he has shown me a glimpse of what it really means to have an actual partner.
 I feel lucky to have him in my life. We have experienced miscommunication and arguments and space needed. I feel like dating as a mother is challenging. But we both put in a good effort to see the others perspective. 
Recently, my new guy found some men’s underwear while we were folding clothes. It triggered some betrayal trauma. I wasn’t too concerned as I have nothing to hide. They were likely my ex’s because my kids go back and forth between my place and his. For a while they were bringing their clothes back and forth with them, and some my ex’s clothes probably got mixed in there. Now they have clothes in both homes. We talked it through, he acknowledges his triggers, he trusts me, and I understand his past experiences with relationships has been less than good and I try to be compassionate and patient. It is a challenge to be with someone who has betrayal trauma and ptsd and is just waiting for the worst to happen because that’s what happened before.. I’m sure there are many challenges to being in a relationship with me too given my situation as a mother of two and past experiences.
I look toward the future and moving forward with him. If all goes well, I can see us moving in together by the end of 2022. When I think about our future I see that the challenges are worth it. I believe that I am choosing to be with a flawed man who is loyal and kind and hardworking. And I must say, the intimacy and sex is like nothing I’ve experienced before!

Also I started to be more talkative, interact with people more, be supportive and spread good energy. This might be stupid, but whenever I interact online I use emojis 😃

She's lost her father, been bullied for her sexuality, been SA, had to put up with my mother treated her, and more. She divorced my mother in 2006 and was an absolute mess. To say the least, she stopped taking care of herself, started drinking, and even attempted suicide a few times.

However, in 2008--when she met my other mom--things changed. My other mom had convinced her to start going to therapy, which helped her tremendously. Soon after, she went to a mental hospital, and from there, she started taking medication.

Despite this, my mother had still felt discontent with her life and often went through depressive episodes. She and my other mom were worried about how seeing my mom like that would affect me. Realizing how was a huge wake-up call for her. She started doing other things apart from therapy and medications. She started showering every day, going on walks, exploring some of her interests, and finding coping methods independently.

Skip to 2021, and my mom is doing great. Her mental disorders/illnesses barely bother her; she's been in a healthy relationship for 13 years, has gained a friend group, and is finally embracing her gender and sexuality.

She should've been living like this from the start, but we'll both take what we can get. I've actually been stepping in myself to make sure she remains happy. I'm visiting her more often, offering support, and helping her fight her mental issues even more.

 It honestly makes me so happy seeing her living the life she deserves. I hope that she can continue to live like this, and I will do everything in my power to make sure she can.

happy,"I worked so hard to become mentally healthy after trauma, and I'm finally, actually, really happy!","I went through some horrible things during the last couple of years, which got bad enough that I was even hospitalized after planning to take my own life. I lost countless friends, I lost my best friends, I lost my wife, and I lost nearly every cent I had. I'm still not sure how to keep my house, which my bank is threatening me about. 

I promised myself I wouldn't give up, and I started working with an individual therapist and with a domestic abuse survivor's group every week. I found medication that would alleviate my despair, I changed my physical health habits, and I gradually progressed from being constantly tearful and distraught, to feeling worthy of being valued and loved again. 

I've met someone absolutely amazing, and she and I have been dating since summer, and it's become really wonderful! She loves just talking and chatting, she's so affectionate, she continually builds me up by reminding me how loved I am, and she encourages my growth. After failed relationships and heartbreak, I've become emotionally healthy and found a compatible, positive connection with someone. 

I volunteer at a cat shelter where I specialize in helping abused and abandoned kitties, and it just makes my heart want to burst with joy!

I'm doing art that I'm just so incredibly proud of!

I've found a group of people to play DnD with, and we have so much fun that we barely get anything done from all the joking and laughing!

happy,"I’m finally in an overall good place, after years of pain and struggling","The last 4-5 years have been extra hard. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life and while going through graduate school 9 hours form home, knowing no one, I dealt with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. After finishing grad school, I struggled to find a decent job in my field. I was working terrible jobs that treated me poorly and I was miserable. I thought I wasted all of my time and money in grad school and that I’d never be successful. I got into an abusive relationship that destroyed my self worth and it ended with him cheating and emotionally abusing me. 

Fast forward to today and I realized just how lucky I am. I’ve been working what is essentially the closest thing to my dream job that I could imagine for the past couple of months, and I had been working towards this job for years. I was out on a boat working today with some coworkers and couldnt believe I got paid to do this. My job is in my field, makes an impact, helps me be financially secure, and makes me genuinely happy. Ive been dating the love of my life for over 2 years now, we bought a home together, and he’s going to be proposing soon. He is fiercely supportive of my dreams and is my biggest cheerleader. I have a decent core group of friends and for the first time, I have awesome coworkers who want to be friends and are super supportive. In the next year or two, my parents and hopefully my sister, BIL, and baby nephew will be moving down to my city. After 6 or 7 years I’ll finally get to be near my family again. 

I’m so content that I sometimes get anxious and worry - how could this be? What’s going to happen? Things are going almost TOO well. But...I’m going to enjoy it for now. I never in my entire life thought that I could be in a place like this in my life",birdsofwar1,self.happy,1603248099

So far this year I moved into my own place, went full time at my job, passed my written drivers test and have finally taken my hse tests. I got a 20/20 on the reading portion so I’m sure I’ll  pass(obligatory humblest of brags).

Funny thing about it was during my placement for the classes for it back in February there was a power outage in the middle of the test. Then COVID everything shut down before I could schedule the damn thing.Then yesterday during the math and social studies tests there were 2 power outages. This was a CURSED adventure and it’s finally over. I have never been so proud of myself I walked back to my partners place and I couldn’t stop smiling when I saw them through the window.

I might be able to enroll in classes to pursue a nursing degree before the year is out. I could’ve done it without my partner, and they sure made me feel like it.

happy,"I stopped procrastinating, am exercising again, and switched from walking to biking.","I stopped exercising on May 12th.  I kept trying to mentally push myself to get it done, but I couldn't and it was making me miserable.  So I decided to change tactics, relax, take it slow and easy, and prioritize happiness over productivity.  Just take the time to smell the flowers or get lost in the woods.  Figuratively speaking.  And it worked!  Two things that I did were move my exercise bike around and download an awesome zombie game called Days Gone.  For many years, my exercise bike was facing a wall corner next to my living room window.  All I could ever see was the backseat.  There were a few times when I tried experimenting and had it the opposite direction where I could only see the handlebars, and if I sat on the indoor bike it would give me a direct view of my kitchen and microwave clock.  But I wasn't happy with that either.  So I decided to try something new last week, and I rotated the bike around 45 degrees.  And now, wherever I am, I can see the entire length of the bike from handlebars to seat.  And it's motivated me to ride my bike.  I've been trying to walk 15-20 days a month, but because I sustained serious injuries in a roofing accident when I was younger, it was really stressful on my body.  So switching to biking is a good thing for me.  So for around nine days, I didn't walk or lift weights.  But after taking it easy, I'm finally back at it again.  What a relief.  I hope that I can keep this up and do good for at least another month or two.",idgas01,self.happy,1621670127

happy,"Found a wallet I thought I'd lost years ago. Turns out it was in a semi-hidden compartment in my desk I forgot about. Not very major, but still made me pretty happy.","Several years ago (like 2 or 3) I had one wallet. I got a more compact one, and began using that. However, compact one had less room for money, so I stored some of my bigger bills in the old wallet, then hid that in this open compartment underneath my desk. The compartment is only visible if you stick your head under the desk, and the wallet was only reachable if you stuck your hand in a bit, so I completely forgot it even existed after a while. I knew I hid it for safekeeping but I didn't know where.

Today I was plugging some stuff in, and I stuck my head under my desk for the first time in a long time, cuz I can usually plug stuff in fine by just squatting with my head level with the desk. I noticed the compartment, and stuck my hand in there to see if there was something there, and behold my wallet.

happy,"My bosses love me and I’m crying I’m so happy, how do I show them I appreciate them?!","Recently I’ve been having trouble with a coworker, so my boss sat us down and we attempted to clear the air. 

(I think it’s also worth mentioning my bosses and I have been friends since before I got the job, and that it’s a small business- they are a married couple.) 

We had a meeting, it went ok- but I was still only cautiously optimistic. After the coworker left, my boss came to me directly and told me in no uncertain terms that she’d never want to lose me as an employee or a friend, and that she will do whatever she has to to keep me around- even if that means firing the troublesome coworker- after giving them a fair chance to improve of course.

I was happy enough knowing that my first boss felt so warmly about me- I felt so appreciated. 

But later, her husband (other boss) sent me a message telling me that while he supports giving the coworker a fair shot- that he really didn’t care for them and would also choose me over them. Negativity for the coworker aside, it just made me so happy to know they both think so highly of me and value me so much.

I want to show them I appreciate them with some kind of gesture, but I don’t know what to do. They are both retired musicians, and the husband worked with a law firm for several years. I know he has a fascination with prison buildings, and also he happens to be from Japan. The wife is very funny, she’s the primary boss of the cafe, and definitely “wears the pants” so to speak in their relationship. I know she likes things that are cute but not cutesy, and she is following a pretty strict diet right now- she is not Japanese.

But today, it just kept bunching up under the door preventing my door from opening.  I wasn't sure what to do.  I removed the door draft stopper, brushed the dirt and lint off, and then as I was putting it back on I noticed that the cotton in the middle part that goes directly under the door wasn't spread out too evenly.  So I attempted to smooth the cotton out until it was mostly even all over.  And now my door opens and shuts, no problem.  Hopefully it is fixed now.  What a relief.

No one was sitting on their porches talking.  The only thing that was outside were me and a few rabbits.  It was quiet and I was alone, just how I like it.  And there was a strong cool breeze.  That was the best part.  I love breezes.  So I walked for 15 minutes before getting tired, then I hit the ATM and returned home.

But I played it for a while, and I really like it.  The visuals are stunning.  The missions and story seem good.  I don't know if the other areas are boring or not, but I had fun taking my time killing a bunch of zombies at Crazy Willie's using a combination of stealth, molotovs, a pistol (with a suppressor), a shotgun, and melee.  I don't know if the game has any replay value or not, but I hope that it does.  I don't want to play the game over and over again, from beginning to end, on increasing difficulty.  I just want to play one game on Normal mode, and have that game last indefinitely.  Only time will tell if I can do that or not, but at least I will get one good playthrough out of this.  I think that I enjoy Days Gone way more than Dying Light and DayZ.  I own a dozen or two zombie games, and I don't enjoy them that much.

happy,A nice change of pace brought on by who knows what.,"

I’ve been pretty down for a good long bit. A good 3 years of constant drudgery. From major depressive episodes to explosive emotional setbacks. These past two days have been phenomenal. I have no memories of being this at peace in any other time in my life. And it’s not for any particular reason. I tend to attempt rationalizing things no matter how tedious it is, so naturally I assumed this was due to a recent surgery. I had my wisdom teeth removed, and I assumed I was 
A) I was coming off of the effects of anesthetics and my brain was just becoming more active over a period of a couple days. 
B) not feeling as much pain in my jaw or 
C) I was not eating as much, so I didn’t feel as lethargic.

I then broke the day down.

I went fishing for the first time since the surgery and a friend came with me. She didn’t fish, she just hung out and read a book while I fished. I had company. It was 78 F out. The water was very high, and there was a constant breeze. Not too much sun, ever so slightly interrupted by clouds. I caught four fish, 3 baby striped bass and a snook. Nothing big or spectacular. I hadn’t lost any gear, my knife didn’t get wet. I wasn’t tired afterwards, I didn’t get sunburned, I wasn’t hungry, I wasn’t dehydrated. We were in a semi isolated spot that couldn’t be seen from the rest of the park. I drank a small mango smoothie. I listened to music and laughed. And I was happy. I was filled with a grand euphoria of which I have never known.

I was in bliss.

And I was the next day too. But what happened that 
next day?

Nothing of note. At least to anyone without a habit of over-analyzing.

I rode my bike and picked up a prescription from the pharmacy. I rode my bike through town to pick up some soap. I realized I left my card at home and went back to get it. I returned and bought my soap and came home. A suture from surgery fell out of my mouth. Nothing happened that was out of the ordinary. And yet this day I felt such peace and happiness.

These past two days have been the best I’ve experienced in the past 6 years of my life. I have never    Felt such peace and bliss. And I don’t know why. If it wasn’t the little things, what was causing such joy within me?

Maybe such a pure and meaningless joy is somewhat foreign to me in recent years. That’s okay, I suppose. I’m happy. And I haven’t felt this good in so long.

I never want it to end. It will, but that won’t stop me from trying.

Thankfully this happiness bout has come about right after... something. I genuinely don’t know how to describe what happened.

Remember aforementioned friend? Maybe a couple of weeks before the last couple of days she said “you are tired, aren’t you? You seem, like, hollow. Full of static.” I asked what she meant and she said, “I don’t know, it’s just like a light in your eyes.” I stood up and walked home. And I don’t know what she meant.

This change of pace is a welcome one. It’s so entirely minor and insignificant. But I’m loving not dragging my unwilling soul behind me.",nabbyy10,self.happy,1599453587

happy,What are some suggestions for things to do daily for one to feel happy? Here are some things I do that work for me.,"\- **Get into nature**. Take a short walk, eat lunch outside, go to a park for a half hour, even open a window and listen to the rain. Taking a few minutes to connect with the natural world help me feel grounded and relaxed.

* **Meditation.** At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I’d clung onto.
* **Yoga.** Please look after your body as well as your life! Follow your internal compass — your intuition. If something feels right, you’ll know. Even more poignantly, like in yoga, if something feels wrong, you’ll know for certain. When you’re practicing yoga, the movements at hand require a level of focus that demands that you be in the present moment. The practice pulls you from your thoughts because it is stronger than them.Getting into your body in this way is an antidote for rumination and a soother of worry. There are times to think, but during yoga, you are only required to move, and it requires your full participation.
* **Ritual.** For me, it’s making an afternoon cup of tea. Having a small ritual like this that you do at the same time every day provides a touchstone in the day. It’s best if the ritual is a healthy one, of course (i.e., not lighting up a cigarette or pouring a drink).
* **Avoid drama and the people who cause it**. Drama is what I call the manufactured junk that causes conflict and unhappiness. Some people seem like they must always be submerged in drama. My husband and I decided long ago that we weren’t going to tolerate it. We don’t befriend people who bring drama, and we work to keep it out of our relationship. It helps us deal much better with the real ups and and downs of life.
* **Try to maximize time spent on activities that induce «flow.»** Flow is the term for that magical time when you’re so immersed in what you’re doing that you don’t really notice the time passing. We are happiest when we are in flow. So when you do something and realize this is happening, make a mental note of it, and try to build time into your days for similar activities.

If you are interested, there’s a lot out there to get you started. I recommend the mindfulness&amp;yoga apps but please find what suits you. If you have any apps or sites you want to share, please do!

happy,"I learned something about my dad today and it made me really happy, and I wanted to share it.","My dad is a doctor. He graduated medical school the year I was born - 1968 - and trained as a general pediatrician and then worked for more than 40 years (and took care of so many people that I actually ran into the one when I was 2500 miles from home, but  that is quite a different story). After he closed his practice in NJ, he moved to Florida but just couldn’t stop working. He didn’t have to keep working. He just couldn’t stop because being a doctor was all he ever wanted to be, so he started working in an urgent care center near where he lives in Florida - well, sort of. It’s a 30 minute drive each way, which probably isn’t a big deal, but he’s now 78 years old and he’s been doing this for more than 10 years.

So I called him tonight to catch up and wish him a Happy Hanukkah, and asked him what he was up to this week and he said that tomorrow, Christmas Eve, he was going to work an 8 hour shift. He said that he always worked Christmas Eve so that other people who had families and who actually celebrated Christmas, could be with their families. It was the first time he told me that, and it’s just made me stop and think a couple of things. First, it made me see, again, that my Dad is just a really good person. A really decent and stand-up guy. He wasn’t asked to work Christmas Eve. He doesn’t have to work. He just does it.

Second, it made me imagine him sitting there in his urgent care center white coat, and the same stethoscope he’s had for decades slung around his neck, sitting in an urgent care center while patients trickle in, going from exam room to exam room, hunting and pecking away on the computer keyboard (because he’s 78 and electronic medical records are just not his thing), and drinking coffee. And then after a long long day he’ll drive home for a half and hour and then probably fall asleep on the couch watching TV like he did 40 years ago when I was a kid and I remember him coming home after a long day. It’s the picture of my dad that I’ll always remember.

And finally, I realized that he doesn’t ask for attaboys or accolades or recognition. He doesn’t do things like this for thanks or praise or “best urgent care doc of the month”. He just does it because that’s who he is, and dammit if that just doesn’t make me really proud to be his 51 year old son.

So if you’re in Sarasota, Florida on Christmas Eve 2019 and you want to meet a really good guy, go poke your head in at the American Family Urgent Care. Ask for Dr. Blackman. My dad. 

He’ll be there, waiting to help someone.",Oculata,self.happy,1577174069

I grew up thinking I was stupid and lazy, but I found out my horrible GPA in High School was because I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If an assignment wasn't good enough to me, I wouldn't hand it in, because in my mind it was worse to be wrong than to hand it in. This meant a LOT of missed assignments. I hit that roadblock a couple of times in college. I had A's in two of my classes, but I was scared of doing the group projects, so I just stopped doing the work. I figured I would fail anyway. Well, it happened twice in each class. In order to take classes a third time, you have to appeal, and then if you fail it again, you get dropped from your program. That scared me worse than a bad grade could ever do. I retook both classes (in different semesters this time) and passed with A's. I now am just one day away from getting that final transcript, and a month from seeing my degree. I currently have a 3.6 GPA now and I couldn't be happier!

happy,"I don't get to see my best friend often, but yesterday we talked so much that my throat is currently sore.","My best friend (since whatever age I was when I was in fourth grade) is not exactly financially well off (and frankly, neither am I, but I digress). 'Cause of this, he spends a lot of his time working, and for quite a while he was working two jobs.

Not a huge deal, dude's gotta do what he's gotta do. Talking about what sex position Leon ""Jesus Christ"" Kennedy prefers isn't quite as important as money, unfortunately. 

The logical conclusion of this is that he signs up for the US Navy, and thus next month he leaves for basic. 

To add further context, life has been pretty insane for me this year. Went through a tough break up, had to cut a really toxic dude out of my life, cost my family a fuck ton of money due to being too incompetent to pass some classes -- There's a lot of other shit, but if I drag this out too long, it'll make my situation seem a lot worse than it actually is, and I'm actually doing really well, despite it all.

That said, it did make last night significantly more meaningful to me. He popped by my place, we played some games that we absolutely did not like and a grand total of one game that we did like, but we actually spent most of the time talking. He was here for like 7 hours, and we probably spent 5 of it just talking about whatever came to our minds. Basically no pauses, constantly moving on to the next topic with no breaks and no drinks of water because I kept getting distracted by the conversation and thus forgot to get some (Jesus fuck, I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it). Had some great laughs, so existential dread, some bad jokes that produced not so great laughs.

It was a great time, and it makes me really happy that we got to have the moment — ignore my very liberal interpretation of ""moment"". It's the times like this that really make me step back and appreciate how great I have it, despite life being the biggest bitch of them all. I don't think I could have possibly ended this year on a better note.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm pretty sure Leon does it from behind.",Jack-of-Knights,self.happy,1577106718

Well, it turns out that instrument service is a rarer niche than chemists. A recruiter contacted me a couple weeks ago and *asked if they could give me a job*! After being unappreciated for so long at my old job, having that sort of validation feels absolutely amazing!!

Recently I got passed over for a promotion even being the most qualified. Instantly I blamed favoritism. Then I realized it was me. I started googling ""when is it too late?"" 

I came across this wikihow article (of all things) about changing your personality. It said to develop the character you want to be, and just be it. And then (this is real) it said if you think negative thoughts, do so in a  Donald Duck voice. It was so crazy it might just work.

I made a new Reddit account with only wholesome subs. I unfollowed anything negative on fb. I've been policing my toxic thoughts into something more positive. I did some meditating on positivity last night. Tried to avoid politics.

Everything feels different.

When we got her she was really scared of everyone and everything so it took a lot of work in order to make sure she adapted to her surroundings.

Now at the time we had a French Bulldog called Dave and he wasn't fond of Lexie to begin with either; and he would stay far away from her. On top of that Lexie tends to jump at even the slightest noise that's deemed to be loud and she can't sleep easily at night.

Overtime Dave eventually began to like her and he noticed how hard it was for her to sleep. So to combat this every-night he lies next to Lexie and they snore together just so that she never feels alone. Now Dave rests his head on Lexie's every night to make sure she's safe and she hasn't had a bad night's sleep since.

# How to increase serotonin in the human brain without drugs

[Simon N. Young](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Young%20SN%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=18043762)

For the last 4 decades, the question of how to manipulate the serotonergic system with drugs has been an important area of research in biological psychiatry, and this research has led to advances in the treatment of depression. Research on the association between various polymorphisms and depression supports the idea that serotonin plays a role, not only in the treatment of depression but also in susceptibility to depression and suicide. The research focus here has been on polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter, but other serotonin-related genes may also be involved.[1–5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r1-1) In the future, genetic research will make it possible to predict with increasing accuracy who is susceptible to depression. Much less attention has been given to how this information will be used for the benefit of individuals with a serotonin-related susceptibility to depression, and little evidence exists concerning strategies to prevent depression in those with such a susceptibility. Various studies have looked at early intervention in those with prodromal symptoms as well as at population strategies for preventing depression.[6–11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r6-1) Obviously, prevention is preferable to early intervention; moreover, although population strategies are important, they are ideally supplemented with preventive interventions that can be used over long periods of time in targeted individuals who do not yet exhibit even nonclinical symptoms. Clearly, pharmacologic approaches are not appropriate, and given the evidence for serotonin's role in the etiology and treatment of depression, nonpharmacologic methods of increasing serotonin are potential candidates to test for their ability to prevent depression.

Another reason for pursuing nonpharmacologic methods of increasing serotonin arises from the increasing recognition that happiness and well-being are important, both as factors protecting against mental and physical disorders and in their own right.[12–14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r12-1) Conversely, negative moods are associated with negative outcomes. For example, the negative mood hostility is a risk factor for many disorders. For the sake of brevity, hostility is discussed here mainly in relation to one of the biggest sources of mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD). A meta-analysis of 45 studies demonstrated that hostility is a risk factor for CHD and for all-cause mortality.[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r15-1) More recent research confirms this. Hostility is associated not only with the development of CHD but also with poorer survival in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r16-1) Hostility may lead to decreased social support and social isolation,[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r17-1) and low perceived social support is associated with greater mortality in those with CAD.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r18-1) Effects are not just limited to CHD. For example, the opposite of hostility, agreeableness, was a significant protective factor against mortality in a sample of older, frail participants.[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r19-1)

The constitution of the WHO states “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r20-1) This may sound exaggerated but positive mood within the normal range is an important predictor of health and longevity. In a classic study, those in the lowest quartile for positive emotions, rated from autobiographies written at a mean age of 22 years, died on average 10 years earlier than those in the highest quartile.[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r21-1) Even taking into account possible confounders, other studies “found the same solid link between feeling good and living longer.”[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r12-1) In a series of recent studies, negative emotions were associated with increased disability due to mental and physical disorders,[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r22-1) increased incidence of depression,[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r23-1) increased suicide[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r24-1) and increased mortality[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r25-1) up to 2 decades later. Positive emotions protected against these outcomes. A recent review including meta-analyses assessed cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies and concluded that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes.[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r26-1) Mood may influence social behaviour, and social support is one of the most studied psychosocial factors in relation to health and disease.[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r27-1) Low social support is associated with higher levels of stress, depression, dysthymia and posttraumatic stress disorder and with increased morbidity and mortality from a host of medical illnesses.[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r27-1)

Research confirms what might be intuitively expected, that positive emotions and agreeableness foster congenial relationships with others.[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r28-1),[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r29-1) This in turn will create the conditions for an increase in social support.

Several studies found an association between measures related to serotonin and mood in the normal range. Lower platelet serotonin2 receptor function was associated with lower mood in one study,[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r30-1) whereas better mood was associated with higher blood serotonin levels in another.[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r31-1) Two studies found that greater prolactin release in response to fenfluramine was associated with more positive mood.[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r32-1),[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r33-1) The idea that these associations indicate a causal association between serotonin function and mood within the normal range is consistent with a study demonstrating that, in healthy people with high trait irritability, tryptophan, relative to placebo, decreased quarrelsome behaviours, increased agreeable behaviours and improved mood.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r34-1) Serotonin may be associated with physical health as well as mood. In otherwise healthy individuals, a low prolactin response to the serotonin-releasing drug fenfluramine was associated with the metabolic syndrome, a risk factor for heart disease,[35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r35-1) suggesting that low serotonin may predispose healthy individuals to suboptimal physical as well as mental functioning.

Nonpharmacologic methods of raising brain serotonin may not only improve mood and social functioning of healthy people — a worthwhile objective even without additional considerations — but would also make it possible to test the idea that increases in brain serotonin may help protect against the onset of various mental and physical disorders. Four strategies that are worth further investigation are discussed below.

The article by Perreau-Linck and colleagues[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r36-1) (page 430 of this issue) provides an initial lead about one possible strategy for raising brain serotonin. Using positron emission tomography, they obtained a measure of serotonin synthesis in the brains of healthy participants who underwent positive, negative and neutral mood inductions. Reported levels of happiness were positively correlated and reported levels of sadness were negatively correlated with serotonin synthesis in the right anterior cingulate cortex. The idea that alterations in thought, either self-induced or due to psychotherapy, can alter brain metabolism is not new. Numerous studies have demonstrated changes in blood flow in such circumstances. However, reports related to specific transmitters are much less common. In one recent study, meditation was reported to increase release of dopamine.[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r37-1) The study by Perreau-Linck and colleagues[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r36-1) is the first to report that self-induced changes in mood can influence serotonin synthesis. This raises the possibility that the interaction between serotonin synthesis and mood may be 2-way, with serotonin influencing mood and mood influencing serotonin. Obviously, more work is needed to answer questions in this area. For example, is the improvement in mood associated with psychotherapy accompanied by increases in serotonin synthesis? If more precise information is obtained about the mental states that increase serotonin synthesis, will this help to enhance therapy techniques?

Exposure to bright light is a second possible approach to increasing serotonin without drugs. Bright light is, of course, a standard treatment for seasonal depression, but a few studies also suggest that it is an effective treatment for nonseasonal depression[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r38-1) and also reduces depressed mood in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r39-1) and in pregnant women suffering from depression.[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r40-1) The evidence relating these effects to serotonin is indirect. In human postmortem brain, serotonin levels are higher in those who died in summer than in those who died in winter.[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r41-1) A similar conclusion came from a study on healthy volunteers, in which serotonin synthesis was assessed by measurements of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the venous outflow from the brain.[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r42-1) There was also a positive correlation between serotonin synthesis and the hours of sunlight on the day the measurements were made, independent of season. In rats, serotonin is highest during the light part of the light–dark cycle, and this state is driven by the photic cycle rather than the circadian rhythm.[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r43-1),[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r44-1) The existence of a retinoraphe tract may help explain why, in experimental animals, neuronal firing rates, *c-fos* expression and the serotonin content in the raphe nuclei are responsive to retinal light exposure.[44–48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r44-1) In humans, there is certainly an interaction between bright light and the serotonin system. The mood-lowering effect of acute tryptophan depletion in healthy women is completely blocked by carrying out the study in bright light (3000 lux) instead of dim light.[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r49-1)

Relatively few generations ago, most of the world population was involved in agriculture and was outdoors for much of the day. This would have resulted in high levels of bright light exposure even in winter. Even on a cloudy day, the light outside can be greater than 1000 lux, a level never normally achieved indoors. In a recent study carried out at around latitude 45° N, daily exposure to light greater than 1000 lux averaged about 30 minutes in winter and only about 90 minutes in summer[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r50-1) among people working at least 30 hours weekly; weekends were included. In this group, summer bright light exposure was probably considerably less than the winter exposure of our agricultural ancestors. We may be living in a bright light–deprived society. A large literature that is beyond the scope of this editorial exists on the beneficial effect of bright light exposure in healthy individuals. Lamps designed for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder, which provide more lux than is ever achieved by normal indoor lighting, are readily available, although incorporating their use into a daily routine may be a challenge for some. However, other strategies, both personal and institutional, exist. “Light cafes” pioneered in Scandinavia have come to the United Kingdom,[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r51-1) and an Austrian village that receives no sunshine in the winter because of its surrounding mountains is building a series of giant mirrors to reflect sunlight into the valley.[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r52-1) Better use of daylight in buildings is an issue that architects are increasingly aware of. Working indoors does not have to be associated with suboptimal exposure to bright light.

A third strategy that may raise brain serotonin is exercise. A comprehensive review of the relation between exercise and mood concluded that antidepressant and anxiolytic effects have been clearly demonstrated.[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r53-1) In the United Kingdom the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which works on behalf of the National Health Service and makes recommendations on treatments according to the best available evidence, has published a guide on the treatment of depression.[54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r54-1) The guide recommends treating mild clinical depression with various strategies, including exercise rather than antidepressants, because the risk–benefit ratio is poor for antidepressant use in patients with mild depression. Exercise improves mood in subclinical populations as well as in patients. The most consistent effect is seen when regular exercisers undertake aerobic exercise at a level with which they are familiar.[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r53-1) However, some skepticism remains about the antidepressant effect of exercise, and the National Institute of Mental Health in the United States is currently funding a clinical trial of the antidepressant effect of exercise that is designed to overcome sources of potential bias and threats to internal and external validity that have limited previous research.[55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r55-1)

Several lines of research suggest that exercise increases brain serotonin function in the human brain. Post and colleagues[56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r56-1) measured biogenic amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with depression before and after they increased their physical activity to simulate mania. Physical activity increased 5-HIAA, but it is not clear that this was due to increased serotonin turnover or to mixing of CSF from higher regions, which contain higher levels of 5-HIAA, with lumbar CSF (or to a combination of both mechanisms). Nonetheless, this finding stimulated many animal studies on the effects of exercise. For example, Chaouloff and colleagues[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r57-1) showed that exercise increased tryptophan and 5-HIAA in rat ventricles. More recent studies using intracerebral dialysis have shown that exercise increases extracellular serotonin and 5-HIAA in various brain areas, including the hippocampus and cortex (for example, see[58–60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r58-1)). Two different mechanisms may be involved in this effect. As reviewed by Jacobs and Fornal,[61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r61-1) motor activity increases the firing rates of serotonin neurons, and this results in increased release and synthesis of serotonin.[62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r62-1) In addition, there is an increase in the brain of the serotonin precursor tryptophan that persists after exercise.[63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r63-1)

The largest body of work in humans looking at the effect of exercise on tryptophan availability to the brain is concerned with the hypothesis that fatigue during exercise is associated with elevated brain tryptophan and serotonin synthesis. A large body of evidence supports the idea that exercise, including exercise to fatigue, is associated with an increase in plasma tryptophan and a decrease in the plasma level of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine and valine (see[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r64-1),[65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r65-1) for reviews). The BCAAs inhibit tryptophan transport into the brain.[66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r66-1) Because of the increase in plasma tryptophan and decrease in BCAA, there is a substantial increase in tryptophan availability to the brain. Tryptophan is an effective mild hypnotic,[67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r67-1) a fact that stimulated the hypothesis that it may be involved in fatigue. A full discussion of this topic is not within the scope of this editorial; however, it is notable that several clinical trials of BCAA investigated whether it was possible to counter fatigue by lowering brain tryptophan, with results that provided little support for the hypothesis. Further, exercise results in an increase in the plasma ratio of tryptophan to the BCAAs before the onset of fatigue.[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r64-1),[65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r65-1) The conclusion of these studies is that, in humans, a rise in precursor availability should increase serotonin synthesis during and after exercise and that this is not related to fatigue, although it may be related to improved mood. Whether motor activity increases the firing rate of serotonin neurons in humans, as in animals, is not known. However, it is clear that aerobic exercise can improve mood.

As with exposure to bright light, there has been a large change in the level of vigorous physical exercise experienced since humans were hunter-gatherers or engaged primarily in agriculture.[68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r68-1) Lambert[68](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r68-1) argued that the decline in vigorous physical exercise and, in particular, in effort-based rewards may contribute to the high level of depression in today's society. The effect of exercise on serotonin suggests that the exercise itself, not the rewards that stem from exercise, may be important. If trials of exercise to prevent depression are successful, then prevention of depression can be added to the numerous other benefits of exercise.

The fourth factor that could play a role in raising brain serotonin is diet. According to some evidence, tryptophan, which increases brain serotonin in humans as in experimental animals,[69](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r69-1) is an effective antidepressant in mild-to-moderate depression.[67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r67-1),[70](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r70-1) Further, in healthy people with high trait irritability, it increases agreeableness, decreases quarrelsomeness and improves mood.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r34-1) However, whether tryptophan should be considered primarily as a drug or a dietary component is a matter of some dispute. In the United States, it is classified as a dietary component, but Canada and some European countries classify it as a drug. Treating tryptophan as a drug is reasonable because, first, there is normally no situation in which purified tryptophan is needed for dietary reasons, and second, purified tryptophan and foods containing tryptophan have different effects on brain serotonin. Although purified tryptophan increases brain serotonin, foods containing tryptophan do not.[71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r71-1) This is because tryptophan is transported into the brain by a transport system that is active toward all the large neutral amino acids and tryptophan is the least abundant amino acid in protein. There is competition between the various amino acids for the transport system, so after the ingestion of a meal containing protein, the rise in the plasma level of the other large neutral amino acids will prevent the rise in plasma tryptophan from increasing brain tryptophan. The idea, common in popular culture, that a high-protein food such as turkey will raise brain tryptophan and serotonin is, unfortunately, false. Another popular myth that is widespread on the Internet is that bananas improve mood because of their serotonin content. Although it is true that bananas contain serotonin, it does not cross the blood–brain barrier.

α-Lactalbumin, a minor constituent of milk, is one protein that contains relatively more tryptophan than most proteins. Acute ingestion of α-lactalbumin by humans can improve mood and cognition in some circumstances, presumably owing to increased serotonin.[72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r72-1),[73](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r73-1) Enhancing the tryptophan content of the diet chronically with α-lactalbumin is probably not practical. However, increasing the tryptophan content of the diet relative to that of the other amino acids is something that possibly occurred in the past and could occur again in the future. Kerem and colleagues[74](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r74-1) studied the tryptophan content of both wild chickpeas and the domesticated chickpeas that were bred from them in the Near East in neolithic times. The mean protein content (per mg dry seed) was similar for 73 cultivars and 15 wild varieties. In the cultivated group, however, the tryptophan content was almost twice that of the wild seeds. Interestingly, the greater part of the increase was due to an increase in the free tryptophan content (i.e., not part of the protein). In cultivated chickpeas, almost two-thirds of the tryptophan was in the free form. Kerem and colleagues[74](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r74-1) argue that there was probably selection for seeds with a higher tryptophan content. This is plausible, given another example of an early strategy to increase the available tryptophan content of an important food source. Pellagra is a disorder caused by niacin deficiency, usually owing to poverty and a diet relying heavily on corn (maize), which has a low level of niacin and its precursor tryptophan. Cultures in the Americas that relied greatly on corn used alkali during its processing (e.g., boiling the corn in lime when making tortillas). This enhanced the nutritional quality of the corn by increasing the bioavailability of both niacin and tryptophan, a practice that prevented pellagra.[75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r75-1) The Europeans transported corn around the world but did not transport the traditional alkali-processing methods, thereby causing epidemics of pellagra in past centuries. Breeding corn with a higher tryptophan content was shown in the 1980s to prevent pellagra[76](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r76-1); presumably, it also raised brain serotonin. In a recent issue of *Nature Biotechnology*, Morris and Sands[77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r77-1) argue that plant breeders should be focusing more on nutrition than on yield. They ask, “Could consumption of tryptophan-rich foods play a role in reducing the prevalence of depression and aggression in society?” Cross-national studies have reported a positive association between corn consumption and homicide rates[78](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r78-1) and a negative association between dietary tryptophan and suicide rates.[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r79-1) Although the idea behind such studies is interesting, any causal attribution must remain speculative, given the possible confounds. Nonetheless, the possibility that the mental health of a population could be improved by increasing the dietary intake of tryptophan relative to the dietary intake of other amino acids remains an interesting idea that should be explored.

The primary purpose of this editorial is to point out that pharmacologic strategies are not the only ones worthy of study when devising strategies to increase brain serotonin function. The effect of nonpharmacologic interventions on brain serotonin and the implications of increased serotonin for mood and behaviour need to be studied more. The amount of money and effort put into research on drugs that alter serotonin is very much greater than that put into non-pharmacologic methods. The magnitude of the discrepancy is probably neither in tune with the wishes of the public nor optimal for progress in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders.",minimalistcookie,self.happy,1598116601

happy,"I was 300 Pounds, Extremely sick, had terrible friends in 2018/19, and now : I’m a completely different person.","I’m just really grateful.

My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F), have come a really long way in our relationship. He has matured a lot, and I’m happy to support him. I realized a lot of his passive behavior and immaturity came from depression he didn’t want to identify with. I made the choice to stay, and I thought the healing already started last year, but I realize it’s actually happening now. 

I was 300 pounds  and an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic as of last December. I’m now 230, and working out daily to now turn left over fat into muscle. I’m doing really well in college, have my cat Tinkerbell living with me, and gratefully unemployment has been keeping me a float. I plan on moving to another state with my partner, or without, to continue my dream of joining a trade school. 

I dance more often now. I have cut off nearly every friend I had in high school, as well as my boyfriend from his own group, because growing up meant realizing some people didn’t want to see you succeed. Gratefully, unemployment has given us thousands of dollars while our families are helping support us to stay a float in these troubling times (but trust me I’m looking for work everyday.) I can move all by myself and still be okay, and pay my own bills now. I have old friends who had been actual bullies, who still have nothing. And realizing those people didn’t belong in my life, made me the woman I am today. I’m just grateful to not be rude or degrading like they are. I’m just grateful I left the mix of things, because 2 years ago I was depressed and crying daily that I missed them so much. It was so much better to let go, because I’m much slimmer, smarter, faster, and I just... I’m flying. 

And now I have thousands saved, a stronger bond with the current love of my life, and soon a career to start. 

I’m just happy. Of course my relationship needs work, because we’re both always going through changes and we’re young. And working out with my health and body image isn’t always easy every day. But I am happy. I have my love, life, and family, and my kitty. I’m just happy. I’m grateful. And I hope everyone else becomes happier in these tough times too.",captaindrom,self.happy,1602065529

happy,Being greatful for what you have is the secret to being happy,"Life is good right now for us: We buried St. Joseph in the ground in hopes of selling my 1000 foot house which has gotten too small for us. As a family of 6, who knew the kids would grow, acquire more space, and eat more food?! Plus we will be moving in with my in-laws so a house large enough to accommodate all of us would be difficult to find. Now we've always been practicing Christians, and we teach to pray not only when you need something, but also in thanks. We prayed for our house to sell and for an offer we made on a bigger house to be accepted. They had to happen at the same time, or else the offer would fall through if my house was not also sold. So what happened? As I buried St. Joseph and prayed, a flock of geese flew over me headed towards the south. I felt at peace, sitting in the grass with the sunset just peaking over the horizon. I went back into the house and I kid you not, my phone rang. We had several offers on our house and our dream house accepted our offer!! It was, and still is, a very surreal moment for us. If you are religious and you are reading this, God is good. If you are reading this and you are not religious, God is real. I don't want to make this post about religion but I wanted to give my advice. Be greatful. Love your spouse, cherish your kids, and enjoy the moments that make up what we call life. If you are in a bad situation, work your butt off to get out of it. God helps those who help themselves. Don't accept bad people into your life. We are not here very long. I am 43 years old with 4 kids. Yesterday I was 4 playing with matchboxes in my parents backyard on their retaining wall. If you love what you have, you will never want. Easier said than done, but that is the challenge. I am greatful I get a paycheck every 2 weeks, and I am greatful that, for now, I get to work from home. I am greatful for all the additional time we spend with our kids, whether if be board games, walks, participating in their TikTok videos, or us writing a skit together (or cleaning together) on our youtube channels. Every moment is important, and every step is part of a plan. Your life is how it is supposed to be. You are where you need to be in order to grow. Make choices, even difficult ones, to steer your life in the best position to help yourself and others.  -- Mike from CT, USA.

Did this already before and I had like 40 calls which were all great, people appreciated it.

I´ll listen to your challenges and ask some questions, maybe even give some advice that helped me and the 200 other people I coached so far.

I myself build a daily meditation streak of more than 600 days, working out 4x a week, reading 2 books every month (more than 200 books so far), uploaded already 200 videos on my YouTube channel,… ([https://www.youtube.com/c/straightmind](https://www.youtube.com/c/straightmind))

Just to show you that I know how to build habits :)

I also let go of a couple of negative habits such as unhealthy nutrition and overly procrastinating.

(I am not a Therapist, I studied psychology (Bachelor + Master) which makes me a Psychologist in Europe but I did not do the therapy training)

Take care,

I've recently started a new relationship with the man of my dreams! Quick back story, we met back in highschool, had some fun, went our separate ways. After about 16 years we've reconnected and it's been endless fun. I've loved every moment with this man! He is truly amazing and I tell him that all the time. I've also never laughed so hard with someone in my life! He truly makes me happy! 

I have an awesome job at the moment but just scored an even better one last night. It's in the career field I went to school for and absolutely love! My current job is amazing and I've met some really cool people but it's not my passion. I'm am so excited to be back in the field I love especially with the position I will be in! 

Around me, I have the most supportive family and friends! I love them all to pieces and I'm so grateful I have them in my life! 

Life for me has truly been falling into place! Every day is a new adventure and I'm so ecstatic about the future! Life is truly amazing how it all works out especially when you least expect it!",loveyoulaterbyyye,self.happy,1645029729

happy,I got flowers from someone who isnt my parents for the first time.,"Yesterday I got a text from my boyfriend apologizing profusely about forgetting about valentines day because hes been so caught up in a new job. I honestly didn't mind and assured him it was a okay and I'd be happy even I only saw him for a few seconds on valentines day and he doesn't even need to worry about gifts. I love him in general so gifts are never a concern to me.

Well today he was working all day so I didn't expect to see him because I knew how busy he was so as long as I just got to call him later I'd be ecstatic because I love just listening to him talk.

At like 6:40pm there was random knocking at my back door and when I answered it there he was, beautiful white roses in hand. I always used to say out of pure bitterness that I'd never want flowers for valentines day because it was just basic, but I was mostly just mad because I didn't get a boyfriend until I was 18, and now we've almost been together an entire year. I'm so happy with the flowers. This is not only the first time I've gotten flowers from someone who wasn't my parents but the first time I've got a gift from someone I loved.

I just can't believe he got me flowers even though I was perfectly content with nothing as long as I had him.",LilPulp,self.happy,1644917943

happy,This is the best Valentine's Day I've ever had in my life!,"I don't think I've ever had such an amazing Valentine's day as I have this one. I spent from Friday to Sunday making my Valentines gift for my crush. The night before I gave it to him, I shed a few tears thinking of him before I packed it in my bookbag. The next morning, I went to the one of the rooms of the teachers that I thought he had. Turns out he didn't have that teacher. So I went to the office. Didn't do anything. So, I asked one of my friends if they knew him, turns out, THEY DID! So, after 2nd period, we went to one of the classes that he was in, and even though he wasn't there, I walked into the room, stared the teacher dead in the eyes, and said, ""Do me a favor. Please. If you see (insert name) , please give this to him. I appreciate it."" Then I walked out of the room. Later on, I saw him holding the gift and smiling hard as ever. Even when I was about to go home, I saw him holding my gift while he was talking with his friends. The most beautiful thing that happened was when I saw him get off the bus and walk home with a smile on his face with the gift and the rose in his hand. I knew God had answered my prayer. I prayed to God that it would make it to him. And it did! I can sleep peacefully tonight knowing that he will enjoy the wonderful gift that I made him.

I only seriously considered dating in the last year and after about a year on dating apps I finally met someone I had the courage to ask out. We’ve been on 5 dates and it’s been more than I could ever ask for. We’re just always on the same page about *everything*, never run out of things to talk about, text constantly outside of our dates, but still leave time for ourselves.

Our last date we decided to go to a show we weren’t sure we’d both enjoy, it ended up being a great time and we hung out at her apartment after. I stayed pretty late but eventually went home and when I got back I let her know I got back safe and she replied reassuring me that she enjoyed the show we went too, but it wouldn’t matter either way because she really likes going out with me anyway. My heart just about melted and I held back tears.

Toast has been one of his favorite breakfast foods lately, just plain ol’ delicious buttered toast. A few times he’s actually surprised me by bringing me some while I was just waking up, since he knows I love it too.

He usually likes to wake up before everyone else so he can have some alone time, so I thought this would be something nice to do. Giving him a lil bonus so he can spend more time relaxed to prepare for the day ♡ 

I love this man, and I appreciate him so much. I truly do. His presence has enriched my life, given me more hope for the future, and helped me become that much more appreciative of the little moments we share. I feel so lucky and my heart feels so warm right now.

However, a little while ago, I got a new coworker. I typically am pretty open with the fact that it takes me time to get comfortable around new people, and I have been to all coworkers before this new guy came around. And when he did, I just focused on making him feel welcome, as I know how difficult it can be to be the newest one. We became pretty close, and still are.

But, as time passed, and we got a little more time to speak, I decided to just say that I have difficulties with socializing with new people at first. He said ""oh really? I haven't noticed that at all!"" and that made me feel so proud of myself.

Of course there's nothing wrong with being shy, and I think I have come to terms with the fact that I am for the most part. But it felt really good that someone just saw me as something other than ""the quiet one"".

No more suicidal thoughts, no more depression. I'm very happy right now and i thank my stubbornness for allowing me to seek out some help.

I won't have to worry again until the runoffs in Georgia, and then I won't have to worry again after that until 2024. 

I must also add, that over the course of those 4 horrific years, I adopted the most unhealthy coping strategies: I became something of a nationalist to make up for my insecurities about both myself and my country. I completely avoided anything that was not American, books, video games, reddit posts and subreddits, other websites, everything. I don't do that anymore.

happy,"My last job offer, six years ago, was for 4800€ a year. Today I applied for a position and demanded a 75'000€ wage. It took massive sacrifice, and living without heating or portable water, but I did it!","About 6-7 years ago, unemployment, specially for youth, skyrocketed past 50%. I have no family since I turned 18, and I made three suicide attempts between the age of 20 and 24. At the 25 I managed to get into one of Europe's best public universities, graduate from a bachelor, and just graduated from my master's. 

Before getting into uni, I had applied to hundreds of places, and the last positive offer I had was for 400€/month (less than minimum wage) for about 50h of work/week and a 1h30 commute. When I passed the uni entrance exam, I moved into what was an abandoned house for minimal rent. I lived without heating, with temperature dropping near 0C, as me and my dog huddled for warmth. I commuted on foot mostly, with a portion on trains - I also had to carry 12 litters of water and all other groceries uphill for 40min. But I did it, I graduated cum laude from my alma matter, and applied for work a a dozen place. Today I wouldn't think of accepting less than 55'000€ a year, and am actually demanding 75'000€ for the tricky position. Before it would have taken me nearly fifteen years to earn that!

Honestly, just having a heated home will be nice, and I'll live as frugally as possible - my goal is to save as much as I can for the next crisis. But for the first time in fifteen years I feel that economic stability may be possible, and I'm rejoiced!",Head-Maize,self.happy,1604790883

happy,My best friend's gf has always been super supportive of our friendship and it makes so happy that she is such a wonderful person,"For context (if it wasn't obvious) I am a female. My one of my absolute best friends is male. He and I have been close ever since high school. He's been with his gf since about junior year. Now I don't know her as well, she and I are friends and we talk here and there, but we didn't have classes together so I only ever saw her when I saw them together. 

He and I talk everyday, about anything and everything. When I'm down he always does his best to boost my confidence. He is an amazing friend, and I'm lucky to have him. They have a baby together and he named me as their sons godmother. They came and visited me several times when I was away at college.

It makes me really happy that never once has she shown me even an ounce of jealousy regarding my friendship with him. In fact just today she and I were talking and I was telling her I was planning on going back with my husband for a visit, and she was so excited and told me how we should keep it as a surprise for Tom (fake name for my bestie) and how much he would love it if we could surprise him on his birthday.

It just really warms my heart because I know so many females would have told him that he had to stop talking to me. In fact I lost another person I once considered a good friend for that very reason. His wife was jealous of me and made him cut off all contact, which hurt but I got over it eventually.

There really was no point to this besides me saying how happy I am that my best friend's gf is such a wonderful person.",Chayley,self.happy,1604699554

happy,"As a college student, I voted for the first time in the presidential election a few days ago in Georgia.","I have always been somewhat disillusioned about how much my vote matters, considering how there are 300 million people in this country. But, at the encouragement of a very close friend of mine who I look up to very much, I decided to register as a voter in Georgia around a month ago.

However, I figured that my voter ID wouldn't arrive in time for the election, and I had no other form of Georgia ID because I am not originally from Georgia- just here for university- so I decided to get a learner's permit as a foolproof way of ensuring that I would have a Georgia ID on me. I didn't want to use a provisional ballot as those can be messed with, especially considering levels of voter suppression for this election. 

As predicted, my voter ID indeed did not come in time for the election, so I used my brand new learner's permit instead on Election Day. I put my ballot in the ballot counting machine, and watched as the number of counted ballots rose: 96 to 97. Then I left, assuming that 'oh well, I've done my civic duty, I'm sure there will be larger than a 1-2% margin anyway'.

Except Georgia ended up being one of the most nail-biting battleground states; as I'm writing this, Trump and Biden are only around a thousand votes apart. And one of those thousand votes that made the difference is mine! This experience has really inspired me to be more involved civically: I have seen for myself that, yes, my vote really CAN matter! It's a great feeling to think that my actions, in some small way, genuinely have influenced the future of this nation.",navyrook,self.happy,1604697405

happy,Youth and Adolescents: The 7 Commandments Before the Age of 30! - Report,"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/i8hhh9hl7ox51.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c7848f835c9b00854ecff07f2d7615e6f23c8d0)

When you are in your 20s, you often feel self-confidence and a desire to live and start. As if you are a nymph who seeks to free herself from her gloomy cocoon (school and university education), jump into the sea of life and experiment alone.

&amp;#x200B;

The period of adolescence and youth in the twenties is the basis from which everything begins. It determines whether you will live a different life full of opportunities and challenges, or a boring traditional life like the one that lived and lived in millions of years like your age.

&amp;#x200B;

The years will make you stand in the middle of the 20s full of opportunities, and the fullness of the thirties full of prudence and caution before making decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are a young man in his twenties or a teenager who has just come out of early childhood and is early to enjoy the difference, I recommend seven quick commandments, which you must take seriously before he is 30 years old!

My doctors refused to prescribe me any other medication beside birth control despite the constant ovarian cyst ruptures, high white blood cell count, my hirsutism growing worse and the constant weight gain.  Couple with my ED it was so hard to lose. 

I stopped gaining weight maybe around august 2021 but sure as shit couldn't lose any weight despite being physically active. THE SCALE IS FINALLY MOVINGGGGG 1 LB AT A TIME BUT IT'S MOVINGGGGGGG.  

I weigh myself weekly and while i do agree weight doesn't equal body composition i still have a weight goal in mind before i tone. I'm finally doing sth right.",red_eye1999,self.happy,1647269466

happy,"verbal job offer, sleeping in until 8am and figured out my anxiety meds","I feel really happy! I know a verbal job offer doesn’t mean anything until I get a written offer but I have 3 other interviews too this week and I think a really high chance of getting the written offer from the verbal offer! All the jobs I am interviewing for are paying 80k+ with the job that I got the verbal for is hybrid and paying 6 figures and seems to genuinely be a really kind workplace doing meaningful work (community capital lending + pension structuring for asset management.) I was a non-renewed teacher so getting a job working with endowments and pensions is amazing! They all seemed so excited for me when I interviewed and it’ll be difficult at first but I’ll catch up and work hard. 

I took today off as a mental health day since I have to talk to HR later so it’s 8am and the first night since January 2022 where I didn’t wake up at 4am due to anxiety attacks or my new anxiety meds (week 3 of taking them.) I slept through the night and the best thing is that my kitty is sleeping next to me, purring happily on my chest. the world has been difficult for me and I think there are a lot of problems still, a lot of challenges and fears in the future but for this one golden hour when it’s raining outside and I am happily in bed with kitty knowing that I am loved and wanted and my anxiety is on the fringes and something that I can drown out with the sound of my kitty’s purrs.

But i met this girl around my age , native of the same nation as me but moved to another , persuing the same line of occupation , we just had too much in common . She was literally me but like better . There is just something about talking to someone completely random and unknown and sharing your feelings and getting the response that tells you that that person is also interested in what you think and speak , which is hard to express but feels just beautiful and amazing . The problem is , because i met her on omegle , so the chances of me getting to talk to her again are impossible and i feel so bad that i couldnt tell her how amazing of a person she is . I know this is impossible and i know that i am stupid af  for this but hey the amazing person on omegle if you somehow read this , thank you and just always keep smiling .

happy,The day I truly felt like I became a dad,"So to offer some background, I took up the responsibility of becoming a single parent last year. I had contemplated taking in an older kid not only because I thought I could at least leave them alone during the day when I was at work, but also because I knew how often older kids get passed up in the system for babies, toddlers and young kids. And after getting in touch with my agency, I eventually found out about a kid that was actually my neighbor at one point, having lived in the same apartment building as me. She lived three doors down from me and I remember chatting with her casually a few times because she would just hang out outside her apartment every day. I had no idea she was the victim of abuse from her mother and felt terrible. I remember the day her social worker introduced me to her, I had to remind her of our interactions and once she remembered, she had the biggest smile on her face. Once I took her in and I spent the first week home with her, it went fairly well. There were some bad habits I had to help break, like she used to swear casually just thought it was normal, and some other small things, but we got over it over the proceeding months and she’s been good ever since. I trust, and love, her and she trusts and loves me.

So the event in question happened about two months ago. I was going to be gone for a business trip for about three weeks and had to leave my daughter with my brother and my niece and nephew. She didn’t mind staying with them but was understandably upset at the idea of me being gone for so long. She wasn’t having a breakdown or anything, just kind of forlorn and sullen. It broke my heart seeing her like that. But I made sure to make our last night together as memorable as possible and stayed up way later than I should have just for her sake. The next morning, I left and it took every fiber of my being to step outside and leave, but somehow I did.

I kept in touch with her and my sister regularly just to make sure everything was going well. Needless to say I hated being gone and wanted nothing more than to hop back in my car and go home. The thing I left for was so needlessly boring and tedious beyond imagining. I mean sure, I liked being with my co-workers and meeting new people, but I would rather be elsewhere of course. Somehow I got through it though and woke up extremely early the next morning and put petal to the metal to get home (don’t worry, I slept enough and wasn’t tired while driving or anything like that). It was like something out of a Hallmark movie because, when I got to my brother’s, she literally burst out of the front door and jumped into my arms, nearly knocking me over. “She acts like I just came home from war or something” I said to my brother and all three of us laughed. This was the moment I truly felt like a dad. Because I was just so in the moment for once in my life and didn’t think about anything else except her and me. It’s that thing where we just look at each other and smile, not saying anything, and we just know how much we care about each other. We touched our heads and even I felt myself cry a little bit.

That day in particular was THE DAY for me. And it mad me realize that, for me, the hardest thing about being a parent so far isn’t having to deal with her bad days or stuff at school or any of that. It’s knowing I can’t always be around 24/7. Yes, she has my brother and other family to count on for support and is close with all of them. But the idea of her being gone one day and off to college or wherever she goes frightens me a bit. I know it shouldn’t, but it does. Nevertheless, I try to focus on the here and now as much as I can and do anything and everything for her. If I really had to do it all over again, I would’ve gotten her out of that place and away from her mom much sooner.",black_impala_65,self.happy,1623170246

Most of the people I ask are hesitant because they claim they can't draw, but it's not true! I assure them that they can draw a dragon, or a fantasy creature of their choice, in any way they want and I will not judge, I'll always be happy they tried. I've gotten so many dragons (about 10 right now) and I love how unique and different they are from each other. Each reminds me of the person that drew it and I just cannot describe how happy I am that some people dedicated minutes or even hours of their days to make me a drawing. I've mostly asked friends but also family and a few internet friends too and they all did amazing! Some do a simple design, some have a more complicated one, there are cute dragons, fierce dragons, silly dragons, a couple new creatures, some with colors, some without. My mom did one and my brother too, and it took some convincing to make them do it but they did and I could see that they smiled too when I lit up.",RainbowDianeCrash,self.happy,1623101216

happy,"Initiated a fun conversation with a stranger, and overcame a fitness fear.","I'm feeling really good as I'm writing this, I am genuinely proud of how I handled myself these past two days - in two separate situations.

Trying to get over a bit of a slump, so I forced myself to go on more walks around the city and parks to hit 10,000 steps every day. It's been a really fun atmosphere around the city this weekend because we have the arts festival and pride celebrations both going on in Pittsburgh right now. 

Yesterday, I saw a cute girl sitting by herself and after reminding myself ""regret is worse than rejection"" I went over and started a conversation with her. The chat was entertaining, easy, light, we learned a bit about each-other and got to have a simple pleasant conversation with hundreds of people walking around the park near us. This was the first time I've approached a girl to talk since my 4 year relationship ended. When she and I had to head our separate ways to get to work after about 30 minutes, I scribbled my number down on a piece of paper and gave it to her. It's been well over a day now and she hasn't contacted me and at this point I'm guessing probably won't but that's OKAY! I'm still incredibly happy that I proved to myself I can still engage in a conversation with a stranger, and have the confidence to go start a chat, and handle myself throughout. Please don't interpret this as a silver lining sort of thing, because it's completely fine if we never talk again, I'm happy about the fact I shut up all those negative worried voices and just walked up to someone and said hi. That's a win for me!

Then, this afternoon I was feeling really good after my workout, and had just got my new running shoes in the mail that morning, so I wanted to go for a short run to try them out! I've always been self conscious about my weird abb genetics, mine don't line up nicely across from one another, and I have some light remnants of bacne  from when I was a teenager, 25 now. It's 90 degrees full sun in the city right now, so I rode that happiness I was still feeling from the previous day, lathered up in sunscreen and went for my first run ever without my shirt on.  I ran along the water and ended up at point park, and then walked home to recover through the arts festival and into the city.

While I was walking home some guy in a  white truck was yelling ""hey buddy buddy buddy buddy"" out of his window until  I turned to look at him, in case I something had fallen out of my pocket or he was needing directions, at which point he shouted ""put a shirt on"" and drove off.

I smiled so hard, and I've felt amazing since then. That would have destroyed me like hearing  ""chicken legs"" when I was a ball boy for the soccer team at 13, but now It was the best compliment I could have gotten.

This  jealous turd was so uncomfortable with where he is at physically that  he felt the need to get my attention and try to shame me. I felt wonderful, I know I have my flaws, but I also know I look pretty decent,  and it was really validating. Again, this isn't something bad where I'm seeing the silver lining, but a genuine sign that I've really grown and can handle that with the knowledge that I look good and I'm doing well!

It  realllllllly also showed me the truth of that notion that if you've already  had a success of some sort early in your day, hardships later sluff off  more easily. I knew I already crushed chest and calves that morning, and  had a good run, so I could take this on the cheek.

All in all it's also been a fantastic example that happiness can compound, and you can use each little nugget to fuel you on to do something else, I'm going to keep going and try to work on getting that every day.

Ruth took off her three rings to apply suntan lotion and placed the rings in her beach bag. She carried on with her day, forgetting to put the rings back on her finder. A couple of hours later, Ruth realized she had removed her cover-up and t-shirt from her beach bag. Ruth searched her belongings for the forgotten rings in a scramble and found two of the three lost rings. The most meaningful ring, her diamond wedding band, was missing. Ruth contacted me, and we were able to meet on the beach later that day. Within a few minutes of searching the sand for the lost ring with my metal detector, Ruth’s ring was back on her finger!

My puppies have their own TikTok page and have 
been a part of Tik Tok since they were 5 weeks old. They were the tiniest beans we've had. I look through their old videos from time to time and was doing so today. I ended up on one of their last videos and it was a video of them first as 5 week old puppies and then as they look today, at 10 months. The song was ""night changes"" by One Direction. I cried, thinking about how much the three of us have been through together, how much time I put into their needs and the moments where I'd hold their tiny bodies in my arms and they'd fall asleep.

 There's a part in the song that says, ""We're only  getting older baby, and I've been thinking about it lately, does it ever drive you crazy, just how fast the night changes?"" And it makes me think about how quickly they grew up and how little time I unknowingly had to hold them in my arms. It doesn't make me sad, not one bit, but I do wish I had more tome to hold them, even though I was doing it a lot already. It'll always be my favorite memory with them.

It was playing on my phone when I found out I got into my first choice college, eight years ago.

For a few months, one of my coworkers/close friends has been getting ready to propose to one of my other coworkers/close friends, and I was helping him pick out a ring for her.  They were on vacation this last week and come home tomorrow.  About three hours ago, the song came on at my work, where I've never heard it play before - my work plays all the same songs, and that's never been played there before.  Ten minutes later, she texts me a picture of her hand with the ring on it - he had proposed while it was playing at our workplace.

It’s always felt so temporary and like I’m just waiting and hoping the next place fulfils that void. 

I am moving again, mid-month, so I’m crashing at my boyfriends place for two weeks and he has made it his mission to make his space feel like a home for me because he knows how much it means to me. He has been cleaning, organizing and prepping his room for my stay and im just so grateful for how much he’s doing for me. 

He even said that I could make a small garden in his backyard because he knows how much I’ve always wanted one of my own and since I’ve been apartment living, I’ve never been able to have one myself.

I couldnt be happier.","Every summer I would get so depressed with trying to find some expensive camp to put her in and have to worry about getting her there and picking her up while I worked full time. Last year she even got kicked out of summer camp but paying  for it was so hard and picking her up with stressful.

This year her school took care of all of that. They are offering a free summer camp just for the smart kids AND providing transporation!! I really love the transportation factor because I just got a new job and i have no way of picking her up on time, thankfully... they have a special bus just for the kids that will pick them up and take her home. The bus stop is within few of my doorstep so I dont have to worry about her walking home alone either. 

Its really like God answered my prayers this year. I stress about summer almost all year and it was great to get a letter that she had been chosen for this special program. I think it was partly because covid had a every kid struggling a bit and left a lot of kids unprepared for advanced placement in their next grade level.

happy,"I'm only 0,5 kg left to my dream weight and I feel so elated 😁","For the last two years, I've struggled so much with my weight, and I've hated the way I look to the point of not wanting to go out, because I was afraid people would stare. My bf at that time (now ex) would always point out that I've gained weight, everytime we'd meet. Also people in my surroundings, even my family kept saying ""maybe you should consider losing weight. You can see how much that affected my self esteem... 

I think I wasn't that much overweight, I weighted around 85 kg (187 lbs) - june last year. I'm not sure how I've started my journey. But I guess meeting the right people pushed me in the right direction. 

One day, I woke up, installed couple of apps, decided to try them. They were a bit hard and kinda boring but I wasn't going to give up. I stumbled across a channel which I feel in love with it instantly. The channel's videos showed a handful of workouts that anyone can follow, and most importantly I'm having fun while losing weight. 

So I kept going, day after day, month after month. And here I am today, super happy, because I actually managed to lose 20 kg (44 lbs) in just one year. That was my goal, which I'm super close to achieve it. 

I could not believe my eyes when I weighted myself this evening. 65,5 kg (144 lbs) is there in front of my eyes. All that hard work did pay off in the end. 

There were many setbacks, I fell down multiple time. But here I am, happy, and I'm in love with my body more than ever. I would like to thank the people who loved my body from the very start to this day now. That kind of encouragement is what I needed to keep going. 

Thank you so much for reading my story, I just had to tell someone, how I happy I feel right ❤
And I'm hoping that I can inspire someone, that if I can do it, so can you. I believe in you !

happy,The story of how I fell in love with another woman.,"Throughout high school, I dated a handful of guys but none of them were ever serious as I was attracted to them but never really would have considered marriage with any of them. During my freshman year of college, I was introduced to a guy who played on the baseball team and I quickly fell in love with him. After three years of dating, he proposed and we wed in a beautiful ceremony at the church both my parents and grandparents had married. We soon welcomed a beautiful baby boy and four years later, another son.

I don’t want to focus extensively on the falling of our marriage, so I’ll try to keep it short and simple. After having our second son, things became tense. My ex no longer seemed to want the responsibility of being a father to our two young boys. He stayed out late after work and would go straight to sleep upon arriving home. For the sake of our two very young children. I stayed in the marriage for as long as I could. I eventually learned that he was having multiple affairs and came to the conclusion that I needed to get out. 

I was granted sole custody of our boys and we moved back home to be closer to my parents. Occasionally, my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity. My hometown friends had made lots of new connections since I had left town, so nearly every outing I was meeting new people and making new friends. 

During one of our ‘girls night out’ I was seated next to a very tall woman whom I had not met before. We ended up talking nearly the entire night away and I instantly felt a bond between us. I learned that she was the Vice President of a rather large company and that she had worked all the way up from the CEOs personal assistant to his number two executive. I was beyond impressed and became even more intrigued. Subsequently, I learned she was only a year older than me, yet she had never been married and had no children.

We exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch. I figured that I had just made another friendship, but this one felt different. She was so down to earth and didn’t gossip about others the entire night, which was a breath of fresh air. She seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person I wanted to befriend during a period where I was already under enough stress. 

We soon started meeting up, just the two of us, and I learned even more about her personal life. She revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just eight years old. She had come out of the closet years ago but hadn’t had a serious relationship since high school. A spouse and kids were something she always wanted, but she felt it may never happen. I consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years.

Within just a few months of knowing each other, we became best friends. We did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with the kids (who quickly came to adore her) and give me some ‘rest time’. I somehow didn’t realize it at the time, but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own.

It was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me. She told me that she didn’t want it to change our relationship, but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind. I told her that I needed to think about it. Quickly, I saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad. I started to think about everything in my head at that moment. Deep down, I had developed feelings for her as well. It was all just so confusing to me. I had never been into another woman like that and besides her, I could not find another woman ‘attractive’ even if I wanted to. 

I thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys. Looking at her sad face, I grabbed her arm and told her that I wanted to be more than friends. Her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight. I told her to ask me out. She did and we went on our first date the next evening. 

Things only got better from that point on. Our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news. She held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that I was her girlfriend. I thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me. That’s when I realized that we were probably going to get married. I had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here I was on the verge of being married to one. 

She proposed on our one year anniversary. We married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later. I quickly became pregnant and we welcomed our first daughter ten months after the wedding. Since then, we’ve welcomed three more daughters and I have a fifth in my belly as we speak! Three years ago, my wife was promoted to CEO of her company. Despite holding such a powerful position, she always puts plenty of time aside for the kids and myself. I am beyond proud of her and honestly just honored to be able to do life with such an amazing person. 

I must say that I don’t even see or think about her gender anymore. It’s all pure love. We are soulmates. It’s a type of love and emotion I never felt with a guy and sure wouldn’t ever feel with any other woman. I love her for her and that’s the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart!",jalwy,self.happy,1624072636

The worst is done as far as side affects goes. This bit isn’t as bad (inpatient vs outpatient chemo basically)

I can’t stop smiling. Sitting here waiting for chemo listening to some banging tunes. 

Enjoy your life. It’s a gift. I don’t care what happens next. I have a break from chemo worst case scenario and I feel better every day. 

No matter what’s happening. Enjoy every moment you can. Life is a gift. No matter how bad it gets.

son, Nicomachus - Aristotle set himself the task of identifying the factors that
lead people to have a good life, or not. He suggested that good and successful
people all possess distinct virtues, and proposed that we should get better at
identifying what these are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others !      
What are friends for ?  He identifies three different kinds of friendship :there’s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun there’s a chief interest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment which the other person provides . Then there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances where people take pleasure in each others company only in so far as they have hopes  of taking advantage of it. Then there’s the true friend not someone just like you but someone who is seeing you but about who you care as much as you care about yourself the sorrows of your true friend are you sorrows . their joys are yours . It makes you more vulnerable should anything before this person but it’s hugely strengthening too .

happy,"If you ever feel down, just listen to some happy songs! These singles and albums are very uplifting to me"," Personally  I enjoy music more when i can relate with the subject sang/played  about. It allows me to sing along without feeling ashamed. For example I  wouldn't be able to sing along with most commercial music since a lot  of it is about partying and being horny in da club and such. Songs about  actual falling in love with someone are often very sad as they are  often about heartbreak. So for the sake of this reddit page I compiled a  list of songs that aren't about aforementioned party/horny subjects but  instead makebelieve, nonsense and all things happy:

happy,"How I am almost happy; Approaching 30 and depressed ever since I can remember; starting to figure some things out, take a look if you want some ideas.","Hey guys just want to share my story. I am almost 30 years old. Ever since I could remember I've always been depressed, sad, and angry, even as a kid. Got into alcohol, weed, and a lot of sex with random women that I had no desire to be with long term. To keep it simple, and short, I've eliminated the first two and have been sober for two years. I still find my self meeting new women all the time but I try and be conscious of it because it seems like I use sex as a means of coping with depression, anger and sadness. I meditate every day now and that has helped quite a bit. I stay active, on a good diet, and take vitamin d3 and creatine everyday, both have shown to help with feeling better. As a result of all this I am sleeping better at night which has created a dominoe effect on the rest of my life. The more recovered I am the stronger mindset I have to take on a new day.

Please don't ever give up. I am starting to realize that life is a process that needs daily maintenance. Don't rush through anything, develop a plan, enjoy each step, and make adjustments here and there when needed. You don't need drugs or other people. All you need is within. Although google and the internet have almost been a god send with connecting with other people, hearing their stories, and finding articles that are science based that gives me a better idea of what and what not to look for whether it's diet, behaviors, exercises, how to sleep better. All that plays a part. It's just a big puzzle, and I hope each and everyone of you has fun solving it because I truly believe that's what life is about.

happy,Happiness is guiding others to a treasure I cannot posses.,"**The student I mentored in a scientific research field which I wanted to pursue achieved the goals I'll never be able to do.**

One time, I brought a college kid who resembled the skills and characteristics I had as an undergraduate back then to our country's top university research lab I used to worked at as a researcher. I knew him through a career help subreddit. He became an intern to the project I was working on. A bit of background, I originally wanted to become a full-pledged scientist with the Ph.D and a research career but unfortunately I had to become a family breadwinner at an early age so I quit and got into tech corporate for the money. I left this college kid and I can still remember how he felt so nervous that he might not be as smart as the people in our lab as he came from a country-side university. I assured him that the people there are nice and will never look down upon him. I used to study from a country-side university too so I understood how he must have felt.

Six months later, corporate tech is uninspiring and everyday lately felt like I'm losing my soul and motivation in life. Only good thing is I am paid 3x more now which goes into student loans and family debt. Then, today this student sent me an email that he got into a prestigious research lab in Europe! He'll do another internship there and after he graduates he will pursue higher studies on the same EU lab!!! We're from a third world country so this is really great news. He sent me an expensive gift(he is from a well-off family) as a way of saying thank you for the opportunity. I never expected anything! I am overjoyed that someone who resembles so much of my younger self is pursuing the dreams and goals I abandoned. \*relaxed emoji\*",Psychological_Job_97,self.happy,1633698441

&amp;#x200B;

**Background.**

So a little background on myself, I'm obviously not going to get into the whole detail for detail story of my life in order to not bring down anyone who's reading this and having a lovely day but here is the basics. When I was born, I had some complications at birth causing me to have a stroke down the entire left side of my body. the  moment I was born, I received PT/OT which lasted until I was probably 10 or 11.  Around that time, My family moved to a completely different part of the country. When I got into the new school district, I did not participate in physical therapy because I was scared of being made fun of. Which everyone did regardless.   

Fast forward a few years and I'm in Highschool now, I've been through a lot. I was a rather self loathing person at that point in my life. I lost my best friend, my brother, to college at that point and was not feeling life at all. I was depressed.  I began praying an awful lot idk why, for love, for friends, for anything really.  One day, sitting last year in my virtual class I decided I was done hating myself for no reason.

**I wanted to change.**

I had always been a smart kid; AP courses and whatnot so I always relied on my brain to get me through anything but now I wanted it all baby! I wanted everything.  **I wanted to be someone, someone I was proud of.** I got done with my boring elective course and lingered over to the garage and started lifting the 5 pound weights sitting on the desk. I learned two things that day: Lifting weights is fun and most importantly it's incredible hard. 

**Growth.**

Finding myself increasingly bored with videogames and installing Arch Linux for the 10th time, Weightlifting became this wonderful new outlet for my life. I started doing every exercise I could because it became so enjoyable to me. I also noticed another thing: I was able to do things with my hands and move my fingers in ways I never even knew I could ever do. I went 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40, 40 to 50 and growing every week. My weight lifting had given my an entirely different approach to every aspect of my life. I was finally beginning to be happy with life. 

**On clown nine**

It's my senior year now**.** I am a college student through my Highschool, I show up to a class at the Highschool then I go to the college for two classes sometime during the week. I have a group of friends who I talk to for like 50 minutes after class before heading home and a friend I can text whenever to hang out with. GOD has blessed me so gratefully by placing a wonderful girlfriend in my life who has helped me become so so so much more of a better man and a happier person. I work hard for myself and I pay it back to those who have supported me along the way. about an hour ago, I did 5 reps for 200 pounds. Something that just broke me, making me so grateful about life. I have come so far through so many hardships and I've reached the top. I fly airplanes now, Left handed. I drive, left handed. I partially wrote this, left handed.  I am rarely home, hanging with friends making up the time I've lost over the past few years. 

**Closing**

I am so grateful for life now, I live the life I always thought was impossible for me. I'm getting college applications from colleges I never even dreamed I could ever attend. I am humbled by the beautiful things in life. I don't seek pity or attention, I am confident with myself and I don't need anyone to validate me. I humbled by the wonderful things that have happened to me and wish the best for everyone. To those in a position like me, afraid nothing ever changes, you need to give yourself the chance of a lifetime and be proud of who you are and push yourself to overcome obstacles in your life!

**Closing the closing**

I may have strength and courage now, but I will always be a nerd at heart.

happy,[tw] I can finally heal from my trauma from sexual assault and harassment,"Context:
Two or three years ago I met a guy who put me through hell for several months. I was feeling bad and I didn't know what to do.

Now, I leave the gendarmerie where the woman who listened to me was an angel. She was adorable, really very kind, understanding and in short she was great.

I was stressing about going there but I had to. Last night, I thought about that again. I was very scared of what I was going to do, but at the same time I was so relieved to be able to get rid of this once and for all!

Honestly, I feel understood. And above all safe. Many times this guy came back into my life and threatened me, and even though I know he's not actually going to kill me like he says, I'm sick of him coming back like that because all the bad memories and traumas come back with him.

Now, if he still dares to come back, the police are already on the spot. They will protect me. They'll take care of me so he won't hurt me again.

In short, I am very happy to have had the courage to go to the gendarmerie and to have spoken about it. And I'm happy to have been able to speak and be heard by a woman as caring as her.

Now I feel like I can finally move on and heal from all this stuff. I'm so happy that I want to cry of joy!

I and my parents were both told that I would never be independent, but after a lot of hard work and pulling it together, I've now been living alone for over a year! I'm incredibly proud of myself because I never thought I'd be able to do this, but not only am I several hundred miles from home, I've cleaned, cooked, and taken care of myself consistently for far longer than I ever thought I could, with no signs of stopping. I've even gotten on meds that have helped a lot and pulled off coordinating top surgery and finally getting on T, both of which went off without a hitch! (I also learned how to wrangle insurance, which was no mean feat haha)

Additionally, I've had a spotty academic history that I'm not going to get into, but I have severe executive dysfunction and was out of regular schooling from 14-18. I recently pulled it together and got my GED all on my own--I did the required classes, studied, got myself to the tests, stayed focused through all of them, and passed them with flying colors. I'm starting my first semester of working towards an associate's degree in an IT field, which is something I've always had a passion for but never thought could happen. My teachers have been so nice and accommodating so far, and even though classes haven't officially started yet, I've completed everything I need to do *before the deadline*, which is a huge first.

I was working on an intro for a class and I just realized how much I've worked to get here and how happy I am that I'm finally where I need to be to do what I want to do in life. It's a huge accomplishment and I'm very proud I made it here! I've struggled a lot, but I can finally see everything snapping into place.

happy,"I wrote a 65-page story for my senior high students (using them as the main characters), had it printed into a physical book, and I LOVE how it turned out.","So! My students had a horror/suspense video competition and I told them that I would write a short horror story for whichever group won using them as the main characters. I started out planning to do like a 3-5,000 word story (I do this on occasion because these students are honestly a lot of fun to teach) but it turned into a 14,000 story. My students actually asked if we could read it in class and when I told them we didn't have time in our schedule they said they didn't mind doing extra homework to catch up. 

How wild is that? High school seniors willing to do EXTRA homework to make time to read this in class. 

Anyway, the books came in and we read them for class. The four girls it was written for read their dialogue while another student narrated and another student added sound effects (like doors creaking or distant screams). We laughed SO MUCH the entire class. Some of the students squeezed their deskmates during some of the scary parts (it wasn't really scary, though, haha). Man... it was just such a blast. We've had a crazy amount of fun all semester (in China the first semester just ended last week) and I already can't wait to hang out with them and talk about books next semester.   


Oh! Also, my wife helped with the cover page (ignore the lower case ""p"" in the title, haha whoops!)! There wasn't enough time to make something new so we just stole a ""Hatman"" picture off the internet and she made a couple changes to it, haha. This book obviously isn't being sold, so there aren't any trademark issues or anything, and I think the cover really added a cool element to it.   


Anyway, I was happy because of the book and then extra happy because of the students' reaction to it. It's my first year at this school and I couldn't have asked for a better group of new adults to spend it with.",EdgarMahaffey,self.happy,1642254319

I decided if I was going to be an artist, I might as well just do it on my own time.

happy,Life has gotten better. I'm at a point in my life I never thought I would be in. I'm happy.,"

A few years ago after getting screwed over my junior year of college i had to drop out. I thought my life was over. I was never gonna amount to anything. I was hopeless and felt like i was stuck working shitty jobs in a dead end field. Yay restaurants.

Until i took the male version of ""fuck it imma be a stripper"" and became a Truck driver. I took a major risk. Supported by my then girlfriend now amazing wife. Dropped my current job as a cook and went and got my CDL. 

Months away from home to have a few days with my SO. I made some money but not enough to justify it. Switched to a local job after a year and started making much more than i honestly thought I would ever make without a degree. I have time to spend with my wife and  time to do what I want. We are moving across the country to a state we always wanted to live in and getting out of our small corner we were born into. And have a great job already lined up. 

We arnt scrambling paycheck to paycheck. We arnt worrying about if we can pay the electric bill this month. My wife is starting an Etsy shop to sell the amazing creations she does. because we have the time, money and space to do it. And we are just happy. 

I don't really know the purpose of writing all this out besides it just feels good to *feel* good and i wanted to say it.",Amnial556,self.happy,1642179660

p.s. you would ask why kids still do that in the 21st century? they make money this way 😉 as a thank you, we give them money they later spend on their so desired toys, games etc 😊

happy,"After years of discussions, explaining and arguments, I finally got sterilized yesterday, at only 26years old!","Ever since I got my one and only daughter 5 years ago, I knew I didn't want more. 

Yesterday, after 3 years of serious discussions and arguments with doctors, I finally got it done. I got sterilized, at the age of 26 years old. 

In the days beforehand I've felt so excited about it, had trouble sleeping, like a kid in Christmas Eve. And there was no fear at the hospital. I felt so well taken care of, and I have zero regrets. 

I remember waking up after the operation and crying happy tears. I even told so to my nurse. The relief of knowing it's done, that I don't have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy anymore, it's overwhelming.  

I've gotten a lot of mixed responses about this choice, so many questions, and even comments about how selfish I am. 

But that's honestly fine. In the beginning I got mad that people just couldn't accept my decision. 

Now though, I've realized that I'm in a unique position. I've gotten a kid, I had a nice pregnancy. I have no reason to ""fear"" having more, and in theory I have the resources too. But I just simply don't want more. Sadly many have trouble accepting this as a reason. 

Therefore I'll happily stand up for myself, and for all the others in a similar situation. I will listen to other people's worries, meanings and even judgment. And then I'll camly and clearly explain and argument why this is a choice that's alright to make. 

I think I've managed to change some people minds, to make them understand a bit more. I find lack of information is often the key to misunderstanding and judgement.

If you read this far, thanks for listening to my story. And if you have questions, don't be afraid to ask.

Have a wonderful day 💛",NorthernLightsLover,self.happy,1642146586

I really  worked my ass of since  I just wanted to pass and thought, if not  university  is it, what else  should I do for a living in the future. So weeks came by, I studied so much and yesterday I got my results. 
Not even did I pass,  I got an 1,0! It was so wholesome. I nearly cried. 
I worked so hard  and This is the prove for me that I can achieve anything if I work hard and be patient.

What I like to add is, I had not many friends in school, espacially not for partying. But yesterday, after that succsess I threw a big party at home and a lot of people from university  joined.

I’m not a bad looking dude I just had trouble talking to them and things would always go dry super quick. Now I just started a new job a couple weeks ago and instantly I was way more attracted to this girl than I usually am to other girls I’ve talked to. Instantly we had good chemistry. We made fun of each other in cute ways and now at work we always try to sneak up to each other and scare them to the point they jump. The score is 3-1 in her favour because I have 0 perception of my environment. I asked her for her number and Snapchat 2 days after we met and the conversations were always going right from the minute we woke up till the moment we go to bed. Both me and her flirt through the conversations and at first I wasn’t sure if she was really flirting but now I’m positive. We are both number 1 friends on Snapchat now and we are gonna start making our break line up so that we can go out for food. I’ve never felt so happy about something like this and I just wanted some people to hear as my family and I don’t really talk about these things. 

TLDR: meets girl at work. We talk a lot. Now we are gonna go for supper together.

happy,I found out who my anonymous YouTube idol is IRL.,"I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit, please tell me if there's a better thread. 

Warning: Long post ahead. 

I am following a channel made about a guy who plays a game that is somehow related to his day job.  He translates his knowledge in that field to how he plays this game. 

I followed him since the start of the pandemic lockdown, and I discovered that game because of his channel. He helped me through that time. Even now that I'm busier with my life, watching his videos just calms me and the experience is way better than watching any series or movies.

 Although he is anonymous, he tells a little about himself here and there, especially on his livestreams.

Today, while at work, I got a little bit curious. I tried to find him on Google using some clues that he accidentally gave away.

I found a news segment where he was interviewed and it dawned on me that I now know his real life persona. 

Obviously, he looked different than I had imagined, but putting a face on that voice really made my day. I even told my coworkers about it. 

I am not posting it anywhere, not on our channel's Discord, not on his YouTube channel, and I even hidden some of his info because I want to leave the decision of revealing his face to himself or to faith. 

But oh boy, I'm overjoyed.

TL;DR : I idolize an anonymous YouTube creator who uses his real-life expertise to play a game, and I found out who he is IRL.",baldychinito,self.happy,1646315225

Been packing up 3 large bags full of goodies for the Ukrainians. Plushies for the children, food for their animals (can't forget them) and a large pile of clothes, food, snacks and drinks.

At that point it made me realize how good I have it here in my homeland. I'm currently unemployed due to shit work and even shittier colleagues to boot while COVID seems to give me a hard time getting a new, better job now. I've been dealing with depression for years due to my abusive father and anxiety attacks since December when I became unemployed, I don't have a girlfriend anymore and all that made me feel worthless and weak but... 

It made me appreciate what I have much more now, instead of thinking about what I haven't got as I always do. I still get money, I have friends &amp; family all alive and well, I got a roof over my head, I can go to the gym, go to the bar, play videogames, eat and sleep well. If a war broke out here, what would I have then? They've got nothing but themselves and what they could carry, far away from home. I literally got all this stuff together from my belonging, things ""I didn't need anyway"" or ""thought I might throw away"". But it'd be worth so much to them at the same time. That made me think, even though it's such a simple concept in hindsight.

I feel happy in a different way today. I wish I could've gotten to see the Ukrainians personally and try to put a smile on their face at the border. But the thought that I did something for the cause made me feel some self-worth for once, something that I haven't had for a while already.",valva-iama,self.happy,1646296054

After that, a lady I’ve never met before approached me and told me how happy she was that I was such a nice person for doing that, and then we got to talking for about an hour. Turns out she’s my downstairs neighbor (apartment complex) and told me all about her journey from Pakistan to America. She was so sweet, and so nice to me that it turned my day around 180

Idk where else to post this, but she really made my day, and I’m so glad I got to talk to her about her life story and her family. Even though life was difficult for her, she had such an amazing attitude and it was so refreshing, and completely restored my faith in humanity. There are good people out there, and they outweigh the bad. The way she made me feel just by talking to me was better than any drug I’ve ever done, and I’ve done them all.

happy,today a stranger paid for me and my boyfriends breakfast at a diner while out of town. we didn’t figure out until he had left.,"had me in tears man. i’ve been such a bitter butthole lately… i have been really hard on myself &amp; have been working so hard to not be so hard on others. me and my boyfriend even spent an entire day fighting about dumb shit, we worked things out and came to an agreement that it was dumb. LMAOOO. it happens. 

but this really got me by the heart…

it made me wonder why did i deserve such kindness… i broke down crying because i know he truly wanted his kindness to go to us. how i genuinely knew this, is because he didn’t say a word to us about it. he didn’t whip out his phone and post it on the internet. he just told our waitress he will pay for us, and eventually just left. like a gentle, loving spirit in the night. never asked for anything in return. pure kindness. 

it makes me unbearably sad i’ll never get to see him and give him a giant hug. i’d never want to let him go. i don’t mean to sound cooky, but i really wonder was he sent to me through the divine universe? for some reason? why me? why us?

hey man, at the Hot Stacks diner in Myrtle Beach South Carolina: i want you to know that i’m going to think of this for probably the rest of my life. i’m giving you a big virtual hug right now. me and my boyfriend thank you. him and i have decided that you’re our guardian angel now. &lt;3",ivanna_official,self.happy,1646195607

happy,The guy that I'm seeing helped me overcome my fear of cats while drawing parallels to our relationship.,"I'm kind of afraid of cats. My grandmother had a wild outdoor cat that scratched me as a kid. And an ex had a really grumpy cat that hated everyone but my ex. 

I want to like all animals and I find cats cute but I'm scared of pissing them off. They're not like did dogs, dogs are so easy to read. 

So, this guy and I make love for hours. It's a fling I guess - it's affection and warm and passionate. We finally get to cuddling and his cat hops on the bed and just chills with us. I tense up but he encourages me to pet her. I try, but I flinch as soon as she moves her head to look at me. 

He encourages me again, saying that it's okay, she just wanted to look at me. I confess I'm afraid of cats and he explains. Cats moods are in their tails and ears - if her tail is calm, she probably is too. So he pets her head, and we watch as her tail remains still. Then he says, she doesn't like belly scratches - he moves his hand towards her belly, and her tail gives two quick flicks, so he moves back to her head and the tail twitching stops. 

He takes my hand and helps me pet her ears and head. I'm reluctant at first but then I feel the vibrations of her purring underneath my fingers. I felt like a kid being handed cotton candy. He withdraws his hand and I'm petting her solo. Her tail is fine. He tells me I can rest the weight of my arm of her body lightly. 

""Will that upset her? Isn't that a lot of weight?""

No, he answers, cats find it comforting. 

""She can leave whenever she wants. If you do something she doesn't like, she'll tell you or leave. But she came here for a reason instead of going anywhere else. She wants to be close and she wants affection. Just like you."" He says, punctuating the last line with a kiss on my forehead. 

☺️☺️ 

I mean he wasn't wrong hehe. It was such a cute moment and I felt very safe and comforted and satisfied. And I learned how to pet cats ☺️☺️☺️",Tinder3883838girl,self.happy,1646180286

I went a full week without the pill needing to give me a burst of energy just to get through the day. I worked, I talked to friends, I stayed on task, (I did get very irritable at some points, but I'm working through that too), and I still have an interest in music and my hobbies. I'm not turning to food for comfort either so maybe I can keep this weight off too. I'm just really happy about all of this and I wasn't sure where to post it.

happy,I am ecstatic that the world is going to back to normal.,"This was my first time paying such close attention to vaccine news. I have always taken vaccines that were required and recommended, but I have never followed the development/testing/approval so closely.

I had no idea how vaccine development works, but I am thrilled to see that scientists are finally closing in. God bless the good people of Moderna and Pfizer, and everyone else who tried to help.

The vaccines are not a big on/off switch for the world. The world will turn back on gradually, and some things might never be the same.

Everyone by now has heard the skepticism of whether going back “normal” is possible. I don’t think we’ll ever go back to how things were in January 2020, but we can get back what’s important.

I think we learned for example that some things can happen virtually, like low-priority meetings, so those kinds of things might stay virtual even when it’s safe to go back to in-person.

But there’s so much stuff that HAS to be in-person. Hugs are something I have never missed this much. I was never much for touching, but when you can’t have any physical contact outside your family for 7 months, you really start longing for a hug, even a ballroom dance.

I might never turn down a coffee date again. Not that very many people ever asked me out on them (haha), but having been through such a long period of time when I wasn’t allowed to go out for coffee with anyone, I might just have an open invite for anyone who wants coffee with me. As long as we can drink it together, I’ll buy you the coffee.

The world is such a big place with so many amazing things you can do and so many amazing people you can meet. You can hang out in a book club, you can volunteer in a prison, you can ask your crush out on a date, you can sit at a local coffee shop and write a story with your friends, you can go to an estate sale. When you’ve been denied the opportunity to do all these things, you’ll never take another day for granted again.

Maybe in two months, maybe in six months, maybe in eight months... I have no idea when the world will re-open. But for the first time, we can look forward with great hope that there’s an end in sight. That makes me really happy.",Majeure21,self.happy,1605832219

happy,Finally in a good relationship after a bad one!,"A while back, I was in a relationship with a guy, G. He was really toxic for me, and I chose to deny it every time someone told me so. He had touched me when I said no, he had cheated on me, and manipulated me many times. It was constant arguments, constant sadness, and constant crying. I was hardly ever happy in that relationship besides probably the first month or two. Overall we had dated for only about 13 months. Not too long, but enough to have me afraid of what might come next. 

A few months later, I had met this boy, Y. He was a friend of my guy friend. Y and I started talking quite a bit. I told him I had interest in him, and he told me he felt the same. We started dating and he brought me such happiness. He constantly reassured me if I felt off about something. He would listen to me when I cry and comfort me. If I didn’t want to do something specific, he wouldn’t force me. He respected me and never crossed a boundary. If so, never physically and he was always willing to listen to my thoughts. 

Just a few days ago, Y and I had music on. It was nighttime and we were dancing and singing together. We were listening to Million Dollar Bill by Dawes. He had tried to pull a funny dance stunt and instead fell down bringing me with. I landed on top of him. Nothing more than that. We made eye contact and just bursted out laughing. It was fun.

happy,"I challenged my anxiety, and came home with a rescue puppy","This may be long, so I apologize in advance. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression, but everything has amplified since I lost my fiancé in 2019. I met someone and am happily engaged again, but my heart just still felt so empty. I grew up with dogs around my whole life, but never thought I would get one of my own.

I also have ADHD and can be quite impulsive. On November 11th, my dad said a dog would be good for me so I started looking. I found an adorable puppy on PetFinder named Crouton. I texted the link to my fiancé and he said she was cute, and not much else. I was up all night thinking about her!

The next morning, I woke up and said “Babe, I’m going to go to the shelter today. I need to just see Crouton in person.” I have severe anxiety when it comes to driving and doing most things on my own. My dad wasn’t willing to come with me, and my fiancé had to work, so I decided to go all by myself. It was about a 25 minute drive, one way.

I got to the shelter to put my name down on the clipboard at 8:45 AM. One of my best friends met me there and kept me company while I waited. They started calling people back at 1:00 PM, so I had quite a wait. The way it worked (they’ve changed it since) was you’d get there early, put your name down on the clipboard, and wait for a text. They used to do a raffle but I think since COVID, they changed it to first come, first serve if multiple people were interested in the same pet. I was #8 on the clipboard and the first to write Crouton’s name/ID. That being said, say #5’s dog of choice was adopted by #4. #4 could then look around, see Crouton, and decide to adopt her. It was very difficult waiting so long and I was so scared she’d be adopted. I also noticed a few people on the clipboard after me wrote her name down! She was just so cute.

After what felt like an eternity, my name was called. I quickly exclaimed that I wanted to see Crouton. Within a minute of getting to meet and hold her, I made the choice to adopt her. I didn’t get out of the shelter until after 4:00 PM!

I am so proud of myself for not letting my anxiety win that day. I am so happy to give this sweet puppy the great life she deserves. She comforts me in so many ways, and I am endlessly grateful for her.

happy,"I have gone through a harsh year, filled with depression and other issues, but someone cared for me all the this time without me really noticing","So a bit more than half a year ago everything started to go from bad to worst. I lost a brother to cancer,
My 13 years girlfriend who was also my first girlfriend left me, I lost my job and went from unsteady jobs to unsteady jobs. I was put on medication by mental health services and far from friends and family. 

During this period of my life, a neighbor dropped by very, very often. She brought me food or she just came to talk about things like weather or gossip like a grandma would do. It helped me more than what you could imagine. For a yeah, almost every single day, even under heavy rain or  very cold and snowy days, she would drop by. Rarely she would also drop by with her husband. 

I never really talked to her before. We never really interacted. I knew she lived two or three dozen of meters on the same street. 

So one day I decided to stop being and ungrateful a** and cook something and went to her and her husband's house. He is the one opening and his first words were ""are you feeling better these days ? "". I was surpised he knew about my health situation.

Discussing with him I learned that the few times he saw me during this last year, he could tell I was not good since he had gone through years of depression and several suicide attempt. Since he worked late at night, he could not check on me very often so he asked his wife to keep an eye on me since she in an independant worker who work from home.

All the words of thanks I told him are not enough to express how grateful I am to him for his care and attention. I don't know if I should call his my friend but I contracted a huge debt of kindness that I will repay.

happy,Summary of my 2021 and the things I have learnt.,"Hi, i'm only 15 years old, i'm a student whos stuck from lockdown, I am extremely bored but I wrote this on my personal diary because I love journalling. It would probably give me ""nostalgia"" if I reread my diary when I grow up that's why I must not lose it.

2021 was one of the most boring year in my life but I grew up alot as a person.

I didn't have alot of opportunities to meet new people because I couldn't go to school because of the pandemic. I lost my best friend of 6 years
because we grew apart, my friend who I met at class seems socially awkward and we only talk about schoolwork and memes. I tried to initiate something else as a conversation, didn't work. But, I've talked
to my cousins face to face and was able to socialize, they were my ""best friends"" ever since we were
born because we are neighbors. I use omegle and reddit to have online friends. I've only met one.

Note: I still love my friend because he's a true
friend to me, he's not a good communicator
tho, but thats ok for me.

Another negative that I experienced is mental health issues, I took lamotrigine and quetiapine for Bipolar disorder. My mom had postpartum depression and things became difficult. 

The positive thing is that I had time to discover myself as a person and practiced self-love and maturity. I've learned that people are consistently growing up as a person. I am trying my best to head to the right direction and focus on myself into becoming happier, healthier, and into becoming a better person. My 2021 may have been filled with boredom, anxiety, losing a childhood friend, and mood swings. But I grew up and learnt from my struggles of bipolar and social deprivation from the pandemic.

Things I've learnt in 2021:

-Empathy is the best thing to have when forming connections with people.

-Our struggles teach us lessons in life, everything happens for a reason.

-Self-love is the key to happiness, it comes from within, not from other people.

-Problems are temporary, depression tricked me into believing it would only get worse for me and nobody cares about me.

-Life is like a rollercoaster we all have have ups and downs in life. (mine is just a little bit too extreme)

-Everyone dies someday, that's why you have to make the best out of your life

-Money is not the key to happiness

-We are constantly growing and maturing as a person, make sure we are heading to the right direction.

-Treat yourself with kindness the same way you treat others with kindness.

-Meditation calms your mind.",Dulapeep321,self.happy,1641138987

happy,My grandparents always show up on the tough days,"My son noticed today that I had put up a Christmas countdown wooden tree tonight when I cleaned up. The tree has wooden blocks inside it that I failed to notice when I picked it up and they dropped to the floor. I simply picked up the blocks and put them back in the tree and put it on the mantle. 

He asked me “is that really how many days there are until Christmas?” I told him I was really sure how many days there were but definitely not 39 - the number I had placed in the tree. 

Of course it said 39 days when I googled it. OF COURSE. I’m a fairly spiritual person so I googled it to see what the number 39 meant. My heart was so warm when it said “If you need the angels’ help, do not hesitate to call on them for assistance or guidance. Keep in mind that you are clearing the path for much better things to come into your life.” 

My grandparents passed away in 2018 and my aunt told me at my grandfathers funeral that he was very worried someone need to keep an eye on me to make sure I was ok. I believe he’s here with me tonight on an exceptionally hard day as it’s been almost a year since I left my abusive relationship.

I made sure everyone was comfortable and had to keep an eye on girl S as she tends to be very judgmental and comment on every small thing people do( all from peoples personal eating habits to how someone holds a salt shaker)

 Today she had kept commenting, on how I, a several year experienced baker brushed my cinnamon buns, a tiny detail like that, in which I told her calmly ""I've made cinnamon buns before, believe it or not."" causing her to comment more on every action I did. Later on she went on her lunch shift ( we had shifts so every station had students handling guests at any time) and she manages to get a good time to sit with most our mutual friends. 

They later come to me after school telling me all the awful things she said about me. Bossy, strict, everything! It made me upset up until they also told me almost all of them instantly told her off and that they've never experienced me being bossy or any title alike, but in fact being very caring and supportive and told her to instead lay off the unnecessary comments as they've heard how she judges people so much.

She has brought out some amazing parts of me over the course of our relationship and I am so excited and hopeful for what is next. I've experienced a good amount of professional success and personal achievement over the last few years, but nothing makes me feel better than the feeling I have when I think about the idea of building a future and family with this amazing woman.

Someone took the time to learn my music, practice it, perfect it, and *perform* it. It's a lot of hard work, to learn, perfect, and record---so I can imagine how much time and effort went into the production. This really pleases me!

I am such an amazing person and it’s so cheesy to say, but in the great words of RuPaul “if you can’t love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?” A-Fucking-Men

It took a long, long, LONG ass time to get to this point. I had a shitty childhood. I had mental health issues that got in the way of living my life. I relied on other people’s validation and love to make me feel worthwhile. After a string of awful relationships and my dad dying, I took a step back and tried to work on myself. Don’t get me wrong, it was hell in the beginning and I experienced my worst and possibly longest episode of depression during this time, but I stuck through it and with exercise, medication, and a whole lot of introspection, I finally feel like I’m done chasing after the idea of being happy and now I’m just living it :)",-nilla,self.happy,1636086010

Skip to now, Nov 2021, we have finished moved into our new build and I just feel immensely more happier! I can finally have space in the kitchen to cook, a decent lounge space to workout in, small backyard to do DIYs, and heaps of storage to hold my small business stock.

At first because he lives in England &amp; I live in the US, I figured even a friendship wouldn't last too long but boyyyyy was I wrong

We talk all day, every day (sorta lol cuz ya know... Time zones 😂) whether it be texts, calls or voice messages. He's not at all a dry texter, he's great at keeping a conversation going which is great because I'm terrible at it! With him, there's always something to talk about and it's always a fun subject! 

We share stories about our friends, travels, childhoods, etc etc. We discuss what we still want to do, what we plan to do, etc. 

These past couple days, platonic story-telling and food critiquing has slowly turned into (obvious) flirting and teasing. ""Ayo, hope it's not to early to text you in the States rn"" has become ""Good morning baby girl, have any nice dreams?"" And I absolutely adore it. We still talk about silly little things such as what our favorite thing about ourself is, or what food we'd absolutely never try and why, etc, but we also have deep late-night chats. You know, the ones that make you feel heard and cared about. 

I know that this may very well just be some silly puppy-love that will fade over time... But I'm very much enjoying it while it lasts. And besides, I have a really, really good feeling about this. And my gut feeling has never failed me. Even if he's not my one &amp; only, I definitely think he's here for a long time and that's all that matters to me. :) &lt;3",Rando-Dragon,self.happy,1636011765

happy,My relationship with my girlfriend started because we both happened to have a crush on each other.,"I (11m) have had a crush on my now girlfriend (10f) for about 6 years. A little bit of exposition: I was starting to get close with Alexandra, (Name changed) and there was some huge debate about who her crush was. She, being very popular, always had people asking. During one long walk at recess 64 days ago, I admitted to her that she was my crush. I, noticing her bright blush, asked her who her crush is. This is the following conversation:

A: His first name starts with an I and his last name starts with a B.

Me: You do know that I'm the only kid in the ENTIRE school who falls under that category, right?

A: Crap.

So based on this newfound knowledge of each other, we told her cousin, Kelsey (name changed) that I told A who my crush was. She wouldn't stop asking us. Eventually, the school day ends and it's time to go home. When she's at her mom's A goes to the church her Nana owns. I, knowing this, start my journey down there (I only live about 1500 feet away, or 457 meters). When I get there, I ask her if we can talk in private. Once we're alone, I ask her, ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" the way she stopped walking and stood there, surprised was so cute. Eventually, she says yes, and our relationship has been thriving ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

She said, without even thinking, that the best part was to be with me. Needless to say, that made me so happy. She's 7 and she's just so wise sometimes.

happy,My Wife was finally able to enjoy food for the first time in a year!,"For context, my wife has been struggling with an eating disorder for about a year now. The kitchen, food, and the whole 9 yards gives them severe anxiety. Well last night, my best friend whom I've never gotten to meet in person surprised me and visited to cook us dinner (he drove 3 hours and loves to cook for his friends). My wife, who set all of this up without me knowing, knew he was going to cook and kind of took the hit because it was supposed to be a birthday present. Well I kid you not, while he was in our kitchen, my wife went from nervous to incredibly excited. Yall its some of the best food I've ever tasted in my life.

I want to be able to do that for them. My wife had no issues all night after they got a taste of the food. I want to be able to cook like that, because frankly I never quite had either the funds or the desire to become a chef, and watching my wife overcome one of their biggest hurdles and actually enjoy themselves around food because of how good it was and how special it was....that makes me want to be able to give that to them.

So does anyone have any recipes they want to share? I finally have the funds to be able to cook and the desire kicked into place last night as well. If I can make my wife that happy around food every night I would cry.",RavenoftheMoon,self.happy,1635876044

Something about them just exhibited 'cool' without them really trying. 
I really really wanted to tell them that I liked their hair. I've been an introvert for a long time, and my anxiety is at its peak right now, but today I went 'f it' and I told them I thought their hair was cool. 
They were very nice too.

happy,People making me feel good about myself all of a sudden!,"I never had many friends. I'm an introvert and have the kind of face that apparently makes me look unapproachable and arrogant. 
I'm neither. I'm just shy as hell.
I don't have many friends. I have very few but close friends, the kind I can trust with my life and vice versa, but all of them live hours away. So in the city I live in, I have only colleagues or acquaintances.

Yet in the last 7 days, 3 people I would have considered long time acquaintances at best have contacted me and asked me to hang out. They don't know each other, so it must be one weird coincidence.

I went out with all of them, had drinks (which I know can make me weird) and Every. Single. One of them. said they'd like to spend more time with me/ hang out more often / play video games / go to the theatre etc.

I NEVER had anyone show any genuine interest in me ever before unless I had reason to assume they tried to manipulate me (e.g. I look epic in my new dress: the sudden male interest clearly has nothing to do with my shining personality) and am a bit overwhelmed.

Even tonight I went out and started chatting to random people, and met a Brazilian author (I'm a librarian so books are my thing) who not only signed me his most recent work (""to my new stunningly beautiful friend who I hope will one day go out with me"") but kept complimenting me. And even if I hadn't spoken a word to him, just from his looks, the way he holds himself etc. he'd clearly be miles out of my league. 

I'm not ugly. But at first glance I'm not special either.

Something has changed for me. I know I haven't, yet dynamics are so much more in my favour than I ever thought possible.
I love it. I'm happy. I feel that people finally see the person I am. 

...it bothers me because it's too good to be true 

But right now I'm just happy.

happy,My friend is being released from the psychiatric hospital tomorrow!,"Almost a month ago, an old friend of mine went through a suicidal breakdown and he called me out of the blue for help after two years of no contact. His family is Hmong and they have very traditional gender roles. He didn’t know who else to talk to, so he just called me. He used to be my best friend in junior college and when he told me everything that was going on, I drove four hours from where I was in the middle of the night to come get him and take him to the ER and his family. 

This happened the day before my partner and I broke up and she was in a psychiatric hospital herself. My dad was also having some issues with his heart and I had been dealing with my own issues. It was an absurdly tough period. The last time I had seen him in person, something very similar to this had happened and he hadn’t spoke to me once since then until this particular night except to ask for a job reference. The last time he’d been on the edge, I had told him he could always ask me for help and I’d always be there for him. In the moment of as he explained what was going on, it was all I could think about and I decided I was going to do my best to honor that commitment.

He ended up being admitted to a local hospital and I’ve stayed in contact with him since. We’ve caught up on a lot and he explained why he cut contact the way he did. The reasons are understandable and things got pretty emotional when he apologized. Thing is, this was my dude when we were in school and no matter how much our friendship ending hurt when it did, being human is an imperfect experience. We fuck up, we make mistakes. I’ve made so many in my life, more than I can count. I’ve come to believe it’s not making mistakes that matters, it’s how you respond and react to them. Resentment and hate are also such chaining and corrupting emotions. There’s so much freedom in forgiveness and I know all too well what it’s like to feel alone.

Finally, he is being released tomorrow! I am so freaking excited for him! I am so glad he is still here on this spinning rock, I am so happy he is going to be okay. I’m flying down from Washington later today to spend some time with him. I’ve been living through the most insane periods of my life and this one of the silver linings of it all.

More than anything, I’m just glad that when he called, as piss poor as the timing was, that I was able to just help and that I have my friend back again. So often I’m on the road for work and I would’ve been too far away to really be of any assistance. I don’t know how I would’ve responded had something else had happened. I’ve seen too many people in my life for young in the past few years.",thenomadicphotog,self.happy,1628543945

happy,I developed a mental health related app to be happy from my personal experience!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

I got my first car yesterday. It’s a wagon of crap, but hey, it’s MY wagon of crap. I took my girlfriend for a drive for the first time last night and I took her to a peak that looks over our town. It was pretty dark and we were driving to some quiet music and we couldn’t get the smiles off our faces if we tried to. She bought a Polaroid camera, one of those ones that print instantly and she had it with her, being all retro. She wanted to take a photo of me with the car, and she told me that I’d thank her one day. So she did and I realised I wanted one of her, just for me. I took the camera out of her hands and asked if I could get a photo of her and she let me. Boys, let me tell you, those eyes are tattooed across my memory. I got the photo and I asked if I could keep it, just for me. She said I could if I really wanted to, not realising how important she is. And now I’ve got it. And I keep that photo in my cap. I was actually debating whether to keep it in the mirror that folds up on the ceiling of the car, but I quite like having it in my hat. A photo of the two things I love.

happy,"How I learnt how to love myself at the age of 15. I am not the problem, I am strong and constantly growing as a person.","Hi! I am a 15 year old teenager who became introspective and self-aware about himself. I am from a very unstable family. When I was in 7th grade I had suicidal thoughts, feelings that my problems would go on and on and will not stop, hated myself. But then I realized, I had an ambition, I always thought of saving somebody from suicide and changing the lives of others. I always wanted to become a psychotherapist, and write philosophical stuff, theories on my personal diary of thoughts which I hide.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in 7th-8th grade I was kind of a people pleaser. Too naïve, tried to see the good in all, repressed my anger in order to avoid conflicts, didn't know when things are going too far. But then in 9th grade, I realized that boundaries must be created.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are not really good parents, my mom is emotionally unstable, very bossy, sometimes gets mad randomly, while my dad constantly invalidates my feelings and gaslights me. I cannot get in therapy, they think its useless, both of them constantly fights, there is no more understanding/ agreement between them. My mom is very manipulative towards my dad, threatens to leave us if she didn't get what she want, then my dad would get scared and follow anyways. Convinced them to get to family therapy, didn't work, they think its a waste of time, they never really understood that relationships could recover beautifully even if I told them that. I told my dad the repressed anger and sadness I have been keeping for years, ended up getting told to just accept it, got invalidated. I know that my parents are not perfect in raising me, nobody is perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Someday in the future, I will heal myself from this trauma and now I just have to endure that I am from a very dysfunctional family. I usually just vent to my best friends or online. I really want to move out and go to a university, currently in grade 10, only 2 more years. Cant really make new friends or go out due to the pandemic, its very strict here. So I just have to message or video call my previous friends that I trust.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that this will probably follow me through my adulthood due to the fact that I never really felt loved, so I daydream every night about finding someone who would accept me for who I am, understand me, help me grow and mature as a person. But then I realized, I have myself, I know that I am an amazing and a lovable person who deserves to be loved. People have told me I am soft hearted, open minded, a great listener, never invalidates, intelligent, and not a judgmental person. I confirmed what they said because I finally know my mindset after allowing time for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**This is how I learnt how to love and know myself:**

&amp;#x200B;

**I identified the positive things about me in which I truly believe in, regardless of what some people say**

&amp;#x200B;

I am soft hearted and kind because of my ambitions on becoming a psychotherapist, helping people heal themselves, save people. I know I cant save every person, help the world, but saving one would mean the world to them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am a great listener and open minded, because I would often listen with an open mind and an open heart. I don't invalidate because I believe that the person that can know you the most is yourself, you shouldn't just brush it off, tell that there are many other problems. I empathize.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am not judgmental because I have this mindset where I view people like a spectrum between bad and good. I believe everyone has flaws and it is up to us if we are going to accept them or not depending on the severity of their traits. I know that every behavior has a reason so I should be open and know from their perspective. Sometimes people deserve to be forgiven, but I usually don't talk to them afterwards but remove grudges.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd:

&amp;#x200B;

**I identified the negative traits about me and determined if I should improve it or accept it.**

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am a person who can take a lot of personal stuff from people, very giving, too kind and naïve. But now I know that I have attracted a lot of toxic people. I focused more on myself and decided to cut them all out and keep the ones who I feel like I can trust and are decent and genuinely wants me to be happy and okay. I learnt that its better to have a few close friends than to have a lot of friends. Started realizing when I was in 8th grade. **(Improvement)**

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, I daydream a lot, I can sometimes be very unaware of my surroundings which annoys my parents but I accept that, it gives me insights about life, makes me know more things deeply, gives me encouragement and hope. **(Acceptance)**

&amp;#x200B;

That's all, I know for a fact this will follow me from adulthood, but it would be my responsibility to heal myself, I know that I have myself, me and my friends may someday stop reconnecting but I know that I have and I love myself. Someday I hope to find the one who will love me, help me for more improvement. IDK if I would forgive my parents because I realized that parents are not perfect in raising a child. I just have to focus on endurance, acceptance, and maturity for 2 more years.",Dulapeep321,self.happy,1629558810

happy,How to Be Happy (Instead of Miserable) When You Become 60+,"Millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal. But few define what happiness means, often leading us to chase what our parents, friends, and role models defined as happiness. So when we are back to wearing diapers, we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed.

In my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and science-backed studies about happiness, I've found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isn't. It's like an inverse happiness checklist.

In it, you write what doesn't bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness, whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy, doesn't include any of the items from the checklist. 

The inverse checklist serves two purposes: it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life.

So, for example, if you conclude money doesn't bring joy. But you work from 9-9 because ""hustle is life,"" then reduce the number of, say, side projects you have. Otherwise, you'll be frustrated after reaching financial ""freedom"" and likely feel physically and mentally exhausted.

Each person's definition of happiness varies. However, most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness.

## Your definition of happiness cannot reject distress

We can't control the decisions and behaviors of humans, animals, or nature. Otherwise, hurricanes and phone thieves wouldn't exist. So no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard, potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner. 

To avoid the discomfort from harmful events, some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life. For example, they quit their job to run from their nerve-racking boss. Or switch majors. The issue with this list is its potential size—it's infinite because any event in our lives can distress us.

A more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life. And realizing happiness can coexist with events that don't match our definition of a perfect activity, day, or life. For example, a harmless event like Microsoft Word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day. Or it could become a fun challenge to overcome.

When you welcome distress, you experience two benefits. First, you become used to different causes of discomfort, reducing their chances of affecting you. Second, you realize distress can (and must) coexist with happiness.   

## Your definition of happiness cannot come from others

Most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us, leading to repentance during our deathbed. For example, some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents, while others seek minimalism according to a monk's advice. 

In college, psychologists, doctors, and nurses taught me around 80% of older people under palliative care regretted their lives' choices. But you don't need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life. So instead, change it today. 

First, write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life. You can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them. Second, answer the most crucial question: ""who's someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness?"" 

Ask yourself one last question: ""Is this goal worth pursuing even though X person shares it?"" 

Contrast your answer with other items from your checklist. So if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside (goal), your friends feel the same (influence), but your inverse checklist says you *don't* like being away from the city, then stop pursuing that goal.

## Avoid being miserable on your deathbed.

While your DNA differs from the millions of people who have regretted their life's choices on their deathbeds, you may be following another person's definition of happiness—just like they did. Unfortunately, the old and sick don't have the strength to change their lives drastically. But you do. 

So start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept, one *you* truly believe.

happy,"Coming out of lifelong depression, and I had my second signpost this morning!","For context, albeit brief, I grew up in a narcissistic household with absentee parents. I more or less raised myself, an only child, and figured out everything the hard way. I never really fit in anywhere and found out after I turned 18 that I have Asperger's Syndrome, which explained a lot of things. Today I'm 32, turning 33 in a week, married, and working on some baby making.

I didn't realize it until I met my wife, but I was a generally and consistently unhappy person. I first realized it when my wife was always super happy to see me but I felt dead inside. It really started to come out after we started living together. I never really saw the good in anything. I was happy to be with her and obviously I love her, but from her point of view I was dead. Seeing her slump into sadness whenever she felt there was nothing she could do to help me (I didn't even realize she was trying) hit home for me.

I sought help.

I saw a psych and they prescribed bupropion and adderall. Not long after I realized how limited my frame of reference was, how little I took time to get to know myself and nurture myself, and how bad things were internally for me.

The first signpost was when my wife and my father in law were spending time together and my wife, speaking to her dad, told him how much more active I've been and how happy the dogs have been to spend time with me instead of trying to coddle me. I didn't realize those were issues. He then replied that he can tell I have a noticeable spring in my step and I'm a lot more talkative.

The second signpost happened this morning. I don't remember what happened to prompt this, but I started going through my subs and leaving a ton of subreddits that, while at the time I thought were humorous such as r/trashy or r/IdiotsNearlyDying, I just couldn't stomach anymore. I left a LOT of subs this morning. I looked back over my sub list to make sure I didn't miss anything and I realize I just cut out a huge chunk of negativity in my life. Without realizing it, I was done with the things I'd scroll through every day that were innately negative or depressing and only wanted to see things that made me smile, were uplift, informative, or cool.

I recently spoke with and received approval from my wife to attend a discovery flight before signing up for flight school to get my private pilot's license. Without knowing me this won't have the right context, but three years ago that kind of action and momentum wasn't in my wheelhouse. Today I fly RC planes, flight sim with every moment I can steal, and have found hobbies and interests that really do come from the soul for me. These days I know myself, and every day I'm learning more and more about what makes me tick.

I use to be a depressed mess destined for mediocrity. I made the choice to do better. Today I'm an interesting, amazing, wonderful husband, future father, fur baby daddy, and lifelong friend to myself.

guys i fell in love. head over heels jumping off the diving board in love! and i think our story is pretty cool :)

i (17f) started sixth form at a new school in september 2020. i have a friend (17m), let’s call him timmy, who goes to that school. for the sake of the story we’re going to call my boyfriend adam (17m). 

before i started at this new school, timmy warned me against this boy. he told me “there’s a boy called adam, he WILL try and get with you, don’t do it”. i’d heard of adam before as him and timmy were really close friends so it shocked me when timmy ‘warned’ me against him. he elaborated, telling me that adam had talked to many girls in the past and it had always ended badly. he told me that his relationships never last very long, and the girls he usually gets with are timmys friends, and so it ends awkwardly. 

so it comes to september, and i finally meet adam. he’s an absolute god. confident,attractive,funny and we quickly exchanged snapchat’s. only, i’d totally forgotten about what timmy told me. i only remembered when multiple girls who disliked adam had noticed we were flirting and told me not to be with him. i heard story upon story (some of which weren’t true) about adams past and it was as if everyone was against us ever being a thing. meanwhile, i was coming to like him more and more. 

on november 16 after 2 months of overnight facetime calls and afterschool mcdonald’s dates , he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes with no hesitation. it’s been nine months and i can honestly say that i’m so glad i didn’t let anyone come between us. everyday he makes me feel like a princess and i just feel like my life is pieces together with him in it. i know what you’re thinking. young love never lasts. but i don’t want a future without this boy. 

nothing makes sense without him, and i hope everyone can find this love at some point in their lives.

Then out of the corner of my eye I see him grab a bag of cat treats and he calls my cat, who is the biggest love of my life lol, and he had the ring tied around a string on her neck. So he literally got my cat to propose! It was adorable and I am so happy. The ring doesn't fit but he gave me his mother's wedding ring (his dad has passed) which made it even more special.

The job is animation team leader, it's basically a dream job for me and I've been doing overtime just because I love it so much.

I've always loved my job and being an animator, but it's the first time for me to be this happy and I never imagined that I could enjoy my job even more than before.

I'm doing my best but I had doubts about my performance, but today so many people praised how well I fit the job, how much they like my style of leadership, how well I fit within the team, how fast I got involved in everything, my boss was also happy about it and most importantly my team had nothing but good things to say about me.

I'm a bit tough and blunt so I worried that they might be upset about my way of giving feedback, but the senior animator expressed that he liked that I'm straight to the point and didn't see it as a bad thing.

I'm so happy that I can't stop thinking about it, I never imagined that I'd be here and that I'd achieve this much in such a short time.

happy,"Confessed to this cute girl at my uni, and she said she felt the same!","*obligatory ""I'm on mobile"" ""English isn't my first language"" mention*

I don't really know if this is the right sub for that. I just feel overly happy and I want to share it, the same way one would evacuate his anger in one big rant.

So, there's this girl in my uni. We have friends in common so I see her sometimes at parties, we played in a rpg together, we're in good terms overall but nothing to write home about, really.

There's this week where we go every evening to different bars, to give an opportunity for the newcomers at the uni to meet the other students. Of course I went, and of course she went.

Yesterday evening, I might have drank just a little bit. She went to ask me a question when she was leaving and (I'm certain there was a logical reason but I can't remember it) I ended up telling her that yeah, she's a great person and I would love to get to know her. She didn't really reacted. 

I realized during the night that it was a dumb move on my part. I don't know what I was expecting.

Today, I spend most of the evening acting like yesterday never happened. We were cordial but I didn't wanted to get back on the topic. There was nothing more to say, right?

Anyways I drank a bit again and I was here challenging people to arm wrestling. I don't know why, but I asked her, and she accepted. We had had to move in a corner of the bar to find a suitable table to do it. I won and we started discussing about gender roles or whatever. Anyways, she brought up what I said yesterday. I comfort her that I took some time to think it through, and it was just me forgetting to just shut the fuck up and she shouldn't worry about it. She asked me ""why?"" I told her that I don't know what I was expecting, going to her while not really knowing her first.

She told me that she felt the same, kinda attracted but she would like to get to know me better first.

If that's not a girl asking you to a date I don't know what is.

Anyways, after this bar marathon is over, we plan to have a date together and see where it goes.

I'm just fucking happy because we played a rpg together for a year. If she saw me yell about my Dream Body spell while making mildly offensive jokes about cat people in Tamriel and still think ""I find this man attractive"", then I know I can be myself with her and it won't be a problem.

What makes me smile like an idiot is that, when she finally went to leave, I told her ""see you tomorrow"", and ""I can't wait to see you again"". And she fucking said ""me too"" with that cute shy smile after a second. Every time I think about it my heart melts a little more. She's precious and I can't wait to see her again.",Abserial,self.happy,1631068395

Since my last r/happy post I have moved, and I’m enjoying my new hometown, even if it is filled with boomers :p. All kidding aside, it’s quiet, there’s absolutely no crime, streets are clean, I can comfortably walk to the beach and chill and eat a burger or schnitzel, and best of all I got this new fridge where I’m GUARANTEED cubed ice now!!! :D. It was just fucking awful when there was this really god awful heat wave back in June (got up to 105 degrees) and I literally had to take this big bag of ice and smack it to try and separate them… what a time that was!!! Also on a side note I didn’t realize room temperature Coke fizzed that much when it hit ice lmao. Also on the note of my new house, some of my extended family came over to see it and we all went in the pool in our backyard for a swim, that was a total blast as I haven’t seen them since my Grandma’s funeral a year ago.

On the other hand, all my favorite things to do have come back right around now, car shows are back, motorsports are back, football is back, and I’m just thrilled that I can just kick back and enjoy life and see people’s smiles again! And *everyone* is smiling just as I predicted! I’m sure Reddit can agree that last year was perhaps the most dark depressing time of our entire lifetime but hey we all kept up the faith and we stuck through! And trust me, there were times where I was so goddamn depressed throughout all of last year and most of this year where I felt like ending my life as it just got so stressful. I’m glad that I stuck it out, as my patience is now being rewarded! 

I honestly think that 2022 will be the happiest year in recent history. Anyways to whoever reads this I hope you have a great day and here’s to much more fun and excitement in 2022! :D",kentuckychicken1987,self.happy,1631048112

I've been going through a lot and my parents refused to actually put me in therapy and what not awhile ago so it's just a great feeling that I can finally do that.

Another great thing is the fact that my manager came up to me and let me know that she's going to move some people around and possibly give me a higher paying position than she originally planned. That honestly was just great to find out especially given the fact that it's a $7.50 raise. I was struggling for money at the beginning of the year and the fact that I won't have to worry about that as much once I get this position is just amazing.

happy,After over 10 years of struggle my dream finally came true and I’m still in disbelief,"I never thought I’d get to this day and need to get this out or I’ll burst.

Some background, all of my closest family are naturalized US citizens, but I’m not. I had lived on the East Coast for almost a decade as a student. I spent my 20s with the fear of giving up my life once the visas run out loomed over every decisions I made, while my best friends plan their lives with weddings and job promotions and babies and buying houses. The company where I interned offered to sponsor me, but it’s always a lengthy process with unclear real chances.

Then it happened. I did have to leave the country. Everything and everyone I know is here and I’d do anything to stay, except being an illegal immigrant. My boyfriend of the same predicament left with me. We found jobs in Singapore and stayed there while my company files for my immigration. I’ll never forget how it felt taking picnic baskets with my friends, scouting venues for a fall New England wedding that eventually never came to be. We got married at the embassy in Singapore, not knowing a single soul. We stayed for 3 years at god awful jobs, met interesting people but our life has no sense of home or future. 

But this year, a month after I turned 30, my green card came through. I’m going back to a great company, and my now-husband immediately got an offer for 230k/year because he piggybacked through me and does not need a sponsorship. I never allowed myself to believe so many good things could happen all at once. I was cautiously optimistic about my green card, but thought I’ll be a sole earner for a while as we’ll be recent immigrants. Now we’re going back to our dream city, working at our dream jobs, planning for our dream home.

We’ve just landed in the US today and I couldn’t sleep because I couldn’t stop crying. I’ve never cried happy before.  I’m sure we’ll run into issues and have stress at work and bad things will happen because it’s life, but just for now, everything is just absolutely perfect. I don’t know if I deserve all this and if someone was watching over me made this happened, idk God? Buddha? Allah? My brother? Thank you. 

Also I’ll probably get comments about stealing American jobs or soiling your culture and whatnot. If that’s how you feel idk what to tell you. I’ll be paying more taxes here than the whole of my income in Singapore. I hope some of it goes to helping you personally.",yeet-awayofc,self.happy,1632119305

happy,My boyfriend gifted me my favorite ice tea on our anniversary and i am just so happy about it,"My boyfriend and I are both in our mid twenties and just had our four years anniversary.

He is a gamer and I saw a plushie of one of his favorite games and wanted to buy it for a while now but there was no reason for it and my boyfriend doesn't like getting presents just randomly and even for his birthday or holidays he doesn't want much. I am basically the same, I don't like that it's all about spending and huge gifts. I didn't got presents at all as a child or to make up for mistakes and ""prove"" I was ""loved"" so I am kinda allergic to huge expensive presents myself lol.

However the plushie wasn't expensive, it was just too much to buy it without a reason. He was soooo happy and like a little child and oh my gosh his eyes sparkled and I fell in love with him even more.

He got quite afterwards and a bit sad and said he wanted to remember our anniversary but forgot and didn't had a present because he didn't knew what to get me.

But.. He randomly brought me my favorite ice tea on this day which is only available close to his office.
And that's just the best present I could ask for. He thought of me. I was in his mind. He thought ""Oh let's get girlfriend her favorite ice tea just to make her happy"" and that means so much to me. Also because I don't even know what he could got me myself. When we make each other presents we always say only small things, not more than 50$ and I just have everything I need and want right now. I wouldn't even be comfortable getting an expensive present. 

So long story short: I am just so happy and thankful for my boyfriend and relationship. Sounds cheesy but he's the best that ever happened to me and he's one of the very few people who were there for me when things were really difficult. He was always supportive, listened, cuddled me when I needed it and motivated me to get help and get better. He himself is already the best present.

happy,"I had just a really lovely evening in my cottage in the woods and feel so very content right now, I have no one else to share this moment with!","This is where I’m at right now and I feel so lucky and happy to be in this quiet house in this cozy moment - I just had to share it with someone! I’m curled up in bed, just finished a good book. My cat is purring at my feet, it’s that perfect temperature where it’s chilly but not enough to shut the windows. There’s just a soft breeze so I’m fine by the window wrapped in a duvet. It was sunny all day and the bed is made up of fresh sheets that dried on the line, they smell like sunbeams and the forest. It just started raining and I’m in the room with the awning over the window that has that lovely pitter patter sound, the window cracked enough to let in that amazing rain smell, you know the one. I took a shower before bed, after deep cleaning the house yesterday and burning scented candles all night tonight which somehow adds to that extra clean feeling. I made dinner earlier, Italian with local produce, the herbs and tomatoes were from my own garden. My guy baked us an apple rhubarb crumble after while I did the washing up, with apples from our tree outside and rhubarb from the neighbour. I added some vanilla ice cream, we didn’t have enough of our own strawberries to bake with them too so they were a tasty fresh topping instead, divinity. We rolled a joint from the plant we just harvested from our garden and shared it afterwards. The cat got fresh catnip from the garden and tuckered himself out bouncing around chasing moths. I have the day off tomorrow so no alarms are set tonight. The coffee maker is set to go with coffee for the morning, every once in a while the breeze brings that fresh ground coffee smell by. We are deep enough in the woods now that I can’t see our neighbours, but I can smell that they have their wood stove going through the damp chilly night air as well. We don’t have to share our house with any roommates anymore, so we’ve left the music going in the far room for extra white noise. Radiohead in the rain is extra soothing you guys. There’s an owl softly hooting outside and a couple of tree frogs singing in the distance. We live close enough to the ocean now that every now and then I can also hear a foghorn going softly way in the distance by the lighthouse, we’ve been suffering a drought so it’s been a while since I’ve heard it. My guy is snoring peacefully and the cats purring has turned into soft snores as well, his little feet are twitching while he dreams.

I’ve dealt with a lot of negative crap this past while, moved 13 times in the last 4 years, cross country in there too, and haven’t really had ‘home’ for a while. Living out of vehicles was part of the tougher times.. but soaking in the little things like this lovely night in keep me so very happy with my forested escape in my little comfy house and all the hard work done in getting here, and ready for the hard work yet to come.

Today, I received the offer to become the director of a gallery owned by a world class photographer who has been an idol of mine for years. I've talked to him extensively at this point and he is wise beyond his years as well someone I connect with on a very deep level. This studio is just one of several he owns, but its location is in my favorite part of San Diego and he's even going to give me the autonomy to do things like make my own hours. The position will also fit nicely with my photography and there is room for a lot of growth in the future.

I know this sounds stupid, but I have tears in my eyes thinking about it, what I have been entrusted with and where it can lead.

happy,FREE HAPPY MAIL / POSITIVE POST TO WHOEVER NEEDS IT🐌📮,"Hi everyone! My name is Indie, I’m 20F &amp; I’m from the UK. Like many in this group, mental health, &amp; it’s consequences hit very close to home for me. Due to spending a lot of time in hospital recently I’ve got really into sending happy mail &amp; penpalling! It’s a great way for me to kill time and make new friends, it’s healthy to vent (with respecting boundaries of course!)💕

My happy mail usually includes an encouraging letter, stickers, mental health worksheets &amp; positive quotes. It’s completely free and writing back/responding is optional. I thought it might help &amp; comfort some of you in this group, or even just give you a bit of a pick-me up if you’re having a bad day🌸. 

If you are interested in receiving some positive post, or becoming penpals to support each other, don’t hesitate to message me. Stay safe.🤍

Peace,
Indie🧚🏼‍♀️",Xoxosaskiaaaxoxo,self.happy,1631829789

happy,I saw something last weekend that made me almost cry happy tears,"So I posted a few days ago about how my uncle, who's been like a dad to me these past few years, dropped his plans with his friends and watched a football game with me just so he could spend time with me. Well, during halftime, I went upstairs and used the bathroom. I came out and for some reason just had the inclination to walk around the house a bit ever since my grandparents passed away and my uncle got the house, just to see how much it's changed. 

I went into his bedroom and saw on his dresser in front of the window the thing that nearly made me cry. There were about five photos all of me from when I was little up to now. They were also all photos he took, and the last one was of one I posted a few days ago. He also had his watch that I got him for his birthday and a few other small mementos on his dresser. Essentially, he made a space just for me. And I just sat on his bed staring at them for a good five minutes. 

I didn't have the heart to tell him I saw it though lol.",drift_apart_together,self.happy,1631824483

happy,I'm motivated and excited for my future!,"I've always been very unsure of myself and thought I was inherently dumb and had bad work ethic. A little over a year and a half ago I started to finally learn how to handle my mental health, and started seriously building a skillset in my dream career (animation). Despite 2020 as a whole and a bunch of personal crap, it hit me recently that I'm actually doing really good. I'm almost halfway done with my online animation program, I'm starting a super fancy 3d animation mentorship this week, I'm finally going to take my permit test in March, and my new part-time job is something that I actually enjoy (or in other words don't dread doing, unlike every other job I've had haha). I still have a lot to be stressed about but it just feels really nice to see clear progress on my skills and myself as a person. I'll be super busy, but I've proven to myself that I do have good work ethic after all. It just feels super awesome.

Things aren't perfect of course, and these things have their problems, but I'm realizing that they're pretty good problems to have. On top of that my family is mostly very supportive and loving, and my brother and step-family have saved be from isolating into insanity. I'm super grateful and I know that even if I've just jinxed myself right now and things fall apart, I've gotten to know my mental illnesses well enough to bounce back. I feel good about where I am, stress and all, and I feel even better knowing that I did it all myself and proved to my under-achieving depressed high-school self that I'm capable of... idk, not being a total failure. For the first time in a while, I feel super excited for the future! Thanks to anyone who read all this :D",IronMLady,self.happy,1609998709

I can drive by her house and not feel a thing, I am numb, and I’ve never been this happy in months.
     It’s over, and I no longer feel a need for romance, I feel whole again. I feel like I got my heart back from her, like I’m alive again. I’m no longer ashamed of being alone, I don’t need a lover, and I’m perfectly okay with just being by myself. I found love within myself again.
     The pain, the churning insatiable need for her touch just one last time has disappeared. I stopped dreaming of her, and I can go a whole day without thinking of her.
     I never dreamed that she would leave my mind completely but she did, i worked on myself, and kept moving through each pain staking day, i bettered myself, found things I love like skating and playing guitar, and I am no longer scared to cut ties with her.
I am no longer burdened by the heavy chains that bound me to her pretty face, I crawled slowly out of the hole she left me to die in, and I’ve come back stronger than ever. I’m more confident, I love myself more than I ever have before, and everyone around me has noticed the difference.

happy,I'm happy that I finally found the ONE thing that helped with my back and neck pain!,"Hey everyone! Some good news to share -- Just wanted to share my experience in managing chronic neck and back pain for close to 20 years now. I've tried almost every solution you can think of -- orthopedics, chiropractic, physiotherapists, massage sessions, yoga etc. but nothing ever seemed to work. I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.

The second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.

Hopefully this changes someone's life the way it did for mine :') Cheers, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any other tips!",skyultima,self.happy,1611060301

happy,Escaped friendzone - 6 weeks later and I didn't blow this up,"At the beginning of December 2020 I broke the chain. Thanks to one social accident and few drinks I admitted my feelings to my friend (that I have a massive crush on him). And I was not rejected! It turned out we shared similar feelings. So next was a date. I have never been so stressed and excited at the same time in my life. Thankfully I didn't ruined it, so it went even further and we had sex. I still think that I somewhat ruined it a little - in my defense I never thought that a man could give me such intense orgasm. There was one red flag morning after, when he asked me to not spread the word about us for a few weeks (especially in our work and work-related grup of friends - he is my coworker and supervisor). I agreed, but deep down I was scared that this relationship will quickly end. But it didn't. Week later he told me that he arranged my transfer to different team, so he will no longer be my boss, asked me to spend some holiday's time with his family and to announce our relationship to our friends (if we won't spill that earlier) during New Year's celebration. At the end it went great. First part of Christmas holiday's we spent with my family and everybody loved him. My mother told my in private that she never saw me so happy. Next two days we spent with his family and they all are so caring and loving (with only his sister joking about our age gap). Our announcement during New Year's party ended with few 'finally' from our friends.

Sometimes I could not believe we are actually together. That one day this dream will end and we will be just friends with me stuck in his friendzone. Other than that I am also happy that we are still friends, of course right now we spend more time together, we are doing new things as a couple, sex we have is the best sensation I've had in my whole life (I am a little bit ashamed that if that would be up to me we wouldn't leave 'bed'), but at the same time he is the same person as before.

I'm an indie musician in Denver who makes music in my garage. 

I wrote a new song about the mood-lifting power of a good walk (this year has given good reason for needing this a lot.)

Then I wandered around RINO (neighborhood in Denver) with my videographer brother looking to film ""Denver's Happiest Walker.""

It was good vibes for all and thought it would be a fun video for the community to be happy and walk to!

Here's the video in case you want to check it out!

This artists music has made my life much more bearable as their music has helped me not go down a dark abyss, because it's a reminder of my brother --it's a very strong connection. 

A friend of mine has the capability of making it so I can meet this artist and have a conversation with them, to be able to thank them for making life happier and easier for me. The fact that I am going to be meeting this person once covid is over, cures years worth of pain, even when I haven't even met them yet.

I've always thought of myself as a happy guy (15) but recently I've been getting mood shifts in being happy with friends to the point of screaming with them in discord to just straight up tearing up for no reason. Doesn't help at all that i also got to lose my left nut from torsion so that kinda sucked but i wasn't as devastated as my parents when this happened. Im kinda confused with myself as i get sad and happy about the little things but the bigger things i seem to ignore or just not affect me as much. Is there like a way or tips on how to just control emotions way easier or something? Friends have just said the usual things like do different hobbies and hang out more but in the end, my days currently end with me just sobbing up a bit before bed then tomorrow happens to me like nothing happened. Others say im depressed but i don't think i am since im not really too sad or atleast im sure that its worse than what i have. Need thoughts from strangers here to add to what i should think about to improve myself.

happy,HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY - MEE AND THE BAND - CHASE ME - HELP ME MAKE THIS GO VIRAL!,"Hi everyone! 

My name is Maks and I work a 9-5 job as admin assistant but sometimes edit videos and do artsy stuff. This video is for a song made by my friend and artist Alexandra Sawyer-Hudson aka Mee and The Band.

We are close friends and I worked with and for her a few times before. This is the latest product of our relationship , the music video - edited by me! I received a small payment for this but all views money goes to her and everyone else who looks after her.   


Editing this took me out of a dark place during the lockdown, I must say it was hard, getting up and trying to stay consistent and focus... There was a point where I lost my files, had to redo things and it was all just crumbling down, I felt bad because I got paid half in advance and I am failing to deliver... I somehow managed to find the power within me to finish it, that's why it makes me happy - because I found empowerment in what I can do. Some poeple will like this, some people won't , all I want to share is some love.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you &lt;3

I had already spent a tad bit more at Starbucks then I had anticipated, so I was a little down since the rest of my money went straight into savings. 

So my favorite manager Nicki comes over and asks if I wouldn't mind staying a tad later, I asked 8:30 or 9? 8:30 was fine. I say ok no probs, because she's my favorite. So I'm cashing this old man out, and he tells me to give his change to the next persons order.

I was super happy, and said alright, no problem. Next thing you know, that guy appreciated $3.86 of his order out of 5.40 being paid that he paid for the next person behind them, and the person behind that person, and so on. The biggest amount someone paid? $35 on someone else meal, he didn't even hesitate. My heart was so full I damn near turned into SpongeBob from crying from happiness. 

In total, there were 14, yes FOURTEEN people that participated, and then I had to lock my window down, but that absolutely made my night, no, my week. The stars were also glorious tonight and I could see Orion, so I'm in a just, amazing mood. Faith in humanity, restored.",sociopathicjiggly,self.happy,1615348255

I’m in a real bad place and a friend told me yesterday that I need to find my own happiness. I remember feeling happy with a person or two. But I don’t remember feeling genuine joy apart from that. There’s always been stress, or I have been playing the part. There isn’t a guaranteed happy ending in life, and I’ve always thought there would be. I don’t want to get to the end and realize it isn’t happy. I’m not happy now. It doesn’t seem worth it to me to play and lose.

So how do you find your own happiness? What’s the key?",NIGHTWINGXBS,self.happy,1615301961

happy,"After 8 years of depression and self doubt, I finally got to achieve a dream I had for a long time!!!!!","Hey guys, I've been a long time lurker and I've finally built the courage to get on here and post. For eight years, like many others I suffered from severe depression, self hatred, self inflicted wounds. The list goes on, recently like last year I got tired of hating myself, walking in darkness, crying myself to sleep every night. So I decided to go on a self love journey, just to see if I could do it. this would be my last result before I took drastic matters.... but it worked. After five long months of digging through my past traumas and laying the skeletons to rest. I found true happiness, now I still have bad days but there nothing like the past eight years of depression and with this newfound happiness, self love, peace. I decided to make my podcast ""One time for a good time"" to talk to the people that are still in a rut, struggling, finding their way in life. I want this podcast to be a place where people can come to be uplifted and find peace. I see a lot of people on here have their ongoing internal battles, and I thought it would be nice if I shared a little piece of my happiness with you guys. So please if you want to check it out that would be great, but if you don't maybe share it with someone you think it could potentially help. Love you guys, stay blessed.

happy,I'm proud of myself for spotting a red flag,"I'm 25, single and I was talking to a girl from Bumble. She has unmatched me in the past but somehow we matched again. I asked her why and she said it was because I didn't message her. I said, 'But I didn't message you for a few hours?'

She said, 'It was a day.'

I didn't think much of it. Bit weird, but whatever. We moved to Whatsapp and we were chatting constantly for a day or two. Bear in mind I have known this girl for literally two days. Today, I've been watching videos from Buddhist monks, painting, went for a walk and helped my dad fix the oven.

She asked me what I've been up to. I said, 'Not much to be honest!' Because, I haven't done many interesting things today. Interesting to me, but not to other people.

She said, 'What are you up to right now?'

I said I was watching Football with my family. She said, 'Ok enjoy your night.' In an obviously upset way.

I asked why and she said it was because I hadn't spoken much today. I explained that I had been keeping busy, as I always do because I like having a full schedule, and I don't go on my phone much. She said, 'Well if you were interested you would make time.'

I took a mindful breath and told her that I was no longer interested in her and I don't think we would get along in the future. I am the sort of person who does not like constant texts. I find them kind of empty. Keeping small talk going throughout the day just because you can is a bad way of living, in my opinion. So I stood my ground. She blocked me.

I just wanted to say, I'm proud of myself for doing this. I am proud of myself for taking a stand before things got further. I'm confused that she blocked me, I find it quite childish. She also went and unmatched me on Bumble. Again, I find this childish.

Her blocking me on Whatsapp and Bumble makes me realise that I have definitely made the right choice. Here's to bettering myself for the future when it comes to self-love! I don't need to constantly message people to be happy. I am happy in my own company!",UrbulGroOrkulg,self.happy,1615233709

I didn't feel like the scholarship offered was deserved.  I didn't feel proud, or happy, or grateful.  I felt like I went through the motions.  I didn't have a sense of ownership.  I transferred, graduated, and now I'm feeling a bit better about myself.

My brother on the other hand, suffers from many of the same insecurities and shortcomings in motivation that I did.  He was just offered two scholarships (each about 50% larger than mine) to two colleges he was genuinely interested in.

He's currently in a different state, so I opened his letters for him while on the phone, and I was so happy to give him the news.  After hanging up and sending him the photos, I burst out crying.  He struggles a lot, and I've feared for him.

happy,"Reddit helped me discover my sexuality and understand myself in a totally new way, and I feel incredible","Over the last few months, I've been deeply depressed. This was due to a confluence of several factors, one significant one being the loneliness I feel at never having been in a relationship. I've only ever pursued a few relationships with close friends and not once has it ever worked out. I've tried a bit of casual dating here and there but I always felt a bit out of step with how the dating world works. 

The biggest event that made me feel that something was a bit off was sometime last year, when some friends and I were at a bar. My friend was explaining how to go about meeting potential dates at bars and the like, and he was talking about how you just have to find someone attractive and go talk to them. He asked me about the qualities I find attractive in a person, or what my type is, and I just had absolutely no answers. I tried to explain that I don't really care about looks much, and that I care more about personality and how I connect with somebody. His response was that those are definitely important factors, but when it comes to initiating contact, there needs to be something that draws you together, something that intrigues you about the other person. Not once in my life had I ever experienced a feeling like that, of being drawn to a total stranger, so while I understood the concept he was talking about, the feelings he described were totally foreign to me.

Now, a few weeks back I was browsing reddit. I wish I could remember what sub I was on, but I remember it was just some random, totally innocuous gaming or meme sub. I came across an interesting discussion where people were talking a little bit about this disconnect I've been feeling, and the tendency to be attracted to friends over strangers. That's where the word ""demisexual"" came up, a word I had never heard before.

For those unaware, a demisexual person is one who requires an emotional bond with another person before they can be sexually attracted to them. It's not a matter of the emotional connection being more important, or valuing personality over sex appeal, or anything like that; without the emotional bond, attraction just simply doesn't exist at all. It's a label that falls on the asexuality spectrum.

I related pretty strongly to this sentiment, and I started reading more about it. The more I read, the more I could relate. It felt like someone was basically writing about my own life. There's quite a few experiences common to demisexual people, like being really uncomfortable when someone you don't know well shows romantic interest or flirts with you. Or finding it really, really rare to have a crush or romantic interest in someone, and feeling it *extremely* intensely when you do. Or just not getting it when people talk about others being attractive or unattractive. I related to all of these experiences completely. 

At this point, I am comfortable with saying that I am demisexual.

For a long time, I thought I was in some sense broken, or emotionally damaged, for experiencing romance this way. For example, I would always be down on myself whenever something didn't work out with a friend I was interested in; I felt like part of my problem was that I was always getting too emotionally invested before even attempting to act on it. But I learned through all of the reading that I was doing that this is a common thing that demisexual people go through. Due to the way our attraction works, for some there is no middle setting between ""no romantic interest whatsoever"" and ""100% emotionally invested in the outcome of this romantic pursuit."" It's more like a flip of a switch than a spectrum of attraction and interest. Reading about this, and about how this is more about how I am wired and that there isn't something wrong with me for always getting invested in this way, brought me a lot of peace.

I learned through all this reading that this is an experience shared by many. I'm not broken at all, I just experience love and attraction in a way that's different to most people. There's nothing wrong with feeling this way; that's just how I'm wired. 

Today, I told my best friend about this. She's the first person I told, and in addition to wanting to share it with her, I also wanted to tell her as a way of ""trying on"" the label, if that makes sense. I know it felt right to me doing all this reading online, but I wasn't totally confident yet. I wanted to see if it still felt right when I described myself as demisexual to someone else, and explained my experience. And it really, really did. I felt like, for the first time ever, I could articulate exactly how I experience attraction to others, exactly what the disconnect I feel with how most people experience attraction and dating is, and exactly why I've had such a struggle finding someone to connect with in a romantic sense. Being the amazing friend that she is, of course she accepted all of this, asked questions, and listened to all of my experiences.

It felt *amazing*. I can't overstate how happy I am right now and how genuinely and completely *right* it felt to describe myself with the label of demisexual. I feel like I understand a huge part of myself that I didn't even know existed. I am happier right now than I can remember being in months.

I still have a long way to go, of course; this wasn't a magical cure for depression, and I am still going to therapy to better understand myself and work through a lot of the other issues I've been dealing with. I'm not totally sure if/how to come out to certain family and friends. And looking for love as a demisexual person comes with its own special set of challenges that I don't yet know how to go about overcoming. But I feel like I understand myself in a completely different and deeper sense than I did before, and I feel belonging and validation in a way that I didn't before. Today is the first time I've felt good about myself in a very, very long time, and I'm just so, so happy. It's hard to believe all of this came out of a reddit thread completely unrelated to any of this, but that things like this can happen is one of the many reasons I love this website. Now I can honestly say that it's changed my life.

If you read all the way here, thank you! I'm just really, really excited about all this and I felt like I absolutely had to share.",SuperGanondorf,self.happy,1586492887

happy,"My manager rated me ""Exceeds expectations"" after being at my (dream) job for only 6 months.","I am a software software engineer. I consider myself to be very good at it, despite being extremely bad at almost every other aspect of life. I always felt like I was good at it, but I felt like I was sort of limited and not able to prove myself or get recognition for it (stuck at dead end jobs, etc). Like I said, it's really my only true skill in life, and I was beginning to think I was delusional and really had no skills after all. 

Anyway, \~6 months ago I moved to a different country and started my dream job at one of the biggest software companies on the planet. This alone was a HUGE accomplishment for me. However, I work with *extremely* smart people, and I was beginning to think I didn't belong and my performance was inadequate. I was blowing through deadlines on my tasks and felt like I just wasn't grasping some concepts despite asking over and over.

Today my manager gave me feedback on my performance review and said that I ""exceed expectations"" and it's almost unheard of for people to receive that rating being at the company for such a short time. I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I can finally feel less stressed about how I'm performing and it has removed my doubts about not belonging and feeling like a fraud. I'll likely be promoted sooner than I expected too which is great.

happy,"10 years ago had the gun in my mouth, ready to end it. Right now an ad campaign I helped produce and secure the media rights for is airing during the NFL Draft"," 

Poor kid from a poor family joins the military for an opportunity only to get chewed up in combat before their frontal lobe has fully developed. Didn't get help, didn't have the capacity to know something was wrong so I chased it away with booze, drugs and risky choices. Couple of years of that lead to being miserable, destitute and ready to be done so the Glock was in my mouth. Realized I was a coward in that moment and couldn't do it and vowed after my nap that if I felt the same way I wouldn't be a coward again. Didn't feel the same when I woke up and worked from that point to live a life the people I've lost would be proud of.

happy,Today my puppy was born. Today also happens to be MY birthday too.,"My dog who was my best friend died two years ago. I went in to a deep depression. This dog helped prevent me from killing myself and so much more. For a long time, he was my only friend. Losing him really, truly broke my heart. 

I recently decided to try to open my heart again, so I put a non-refundable deposit on a puppy. Immediately I regretted it, felt like I wasn't ready. I cried (sobbed) for hours that day. I felt like I was betraying my dog and it all just felt too real and I just didn't feel ready. Slowly I warmed up more to the idea. 

Anyway, the momma was due april 20th, but she just gave birth today, April 23. Today is also my birthday. I really like to believe my dog in heaven had a part in this. Somehow making me bond more to this puppy. 

Sorry for the rambling I just have a lot of feelings right now but I am mostly so happy and excited. How exciting, and what a fluke, to share a birthday with my new puppy. For the rest of our lives, we will always have this bond.",honeybeary,self.happy,1587688042

happy,My dad just patted me on the back for the what feels like the first time.,"Just to preface. I'm 24 and graduating as a CS major this year. All of my life my goals was to make my mom and dad proud. My mom is very emotional and I'm so close to her and I love her to bits but no matter how much I try I could never get close to my dad as much as I am with her.

They're both supportive of whatever I do but I always try to do things that make them proud. I don't mean to say my dad is emotionally dead he is very effectionate but I feel he expects more of me than I can ever be, considering all my siblings are doctors so it's a pretty high bar. I always felt he was more proud of them than he will ever be of me so I had no expectations. 


But just that today I finished my graduation project and I got a great review he just looked at me and smiled and just patted me on the back and didn't say anything. I just cried so fucking hard and I have no idea why. All i know is that I'm so happy that I am crying. My mom looked at me confused and I just left.

happy,"Happy Style: a game that will improve mood and relieve stress. You will receive warm and motivational words, and reminders of your dreams and victories","Happy Style is an everyday mood enhancing application and a relaxing and energetic game.

The initial Happy Style concept was invented based on psychological observation: in nervous moments, people often try to get distracted by something, to find aimless work for their hands. For example, simply turn over the pages on the phone screen. I thought it would be interesting to do something with this, to add a bit of joy to the process.

So in Happy Style game levels for Relaxation were born, where in response to finger movements on the touch screen warm words appear: compliments from Happy Style or loved ones, the user's dreams, victories, wisdoms and even… complete nonsense. The goal is simple - to relax and enjoy the process.

Sometimes application sends notifications with a warm word, wisdom, a dream, or the achievement of its user - it's nice to remember that you are worth something.

Happy Style has already contains more than 1000 kind words for both men and women, as well as about 1000 wise quotes from great people. You can easily add new ones, you can record Kind Voices - voice messages from loved ones, and also keep journals of your achievements and dreams… and even your own collection of nonsense.

happy,"I know they'll (probably) never see this, but to the ladies at WinCo last night:","It was late (relatively), and WinCo is one of the very few places still open after 9. I got there at 9:30, giving me just half an hour of shopping after work, myself being an 'essential' retail worker. Between being sore and tired from my shift on my feet and having a bad knee that has me walking with a cane, I'm amazed I made it through the store in only half an hour, getting to the register right as they're announcing it's closing time. 

When I get to the lone open register, I'm surprised to see there's only one person in front of me, and it's such a relief knowing I'll have less of a wait than I was dreading. And as I'm standing there, behind me come two more shoppers, each with a small handful of items. So I hobble myself back and to the side a bit, and wave you both forward. You both try to protest, but I've got more than double what you two have put together, and I don't mind waiting a little longer. You both thanked me and wished me a good night when you were done, and I did the same, and it was just such a pleasant thing to see people being so polite that it was worth the less than five extra minutes.

And I'm not sure which of you it was, but thank you so much for the $20 you snuck to the cashier to put towards my bill. It was a genuinely sweet thing to do that I absolutely appreciated, and it still makes me want to cry just sitting here typing this.

I was a transfer student and had to retake a ton of classes. Also my advisor hated me because her husband and I got in a dispute and the cops were involved. She misled me and I ended up taking way too many credits. Almost enough for two BAs.

I was trying to get a double major but before I could finish the government cut my financial aid funding because I had taken too many classes. I had to work and pay for my remaining classes out of pocket and today, after practicing guitar for weeks, I played four pieces of music for the music faculty members and went through their trial by fire just this morning.

And I passed. I've officially graduated and I'm just so overjoyed. I've honestly never felt so happy. I started crying when I told my girlfriend and Mom.

I never thought I had it in me but I guess I was wrong--even if it took nearly a decade.

Maybe I even have it in me to go further and pursue a Masters. The skies the limit!

happy,Good news during the crisis: I get to work again!,"Hey everyone, I just got great news that I would like to share with you all.

A little background info: I’m from Germany and I study primary school teaching. To support myself and to gain experience in my future work field I work as an inclusion aide. This means I go to school with a kid in second grade and support her, because she has diabetes. While she gets to focus on school, PE class, friends and happiness, I take care of her blood sugar levels and the insulin before breakfast.

In Germany schools have been closed starting March 19th, so I haven’t been able to work since then and missed the kids in the class and of course the money. Since I am a student I am not eligible to get the short-time unemployment benefit which is about 60% of your usual pay. 

Today I got the news that my city decided, that the inclusion aides can go to the kid’s houses and homeschool them if the parents want and need the service.

I just got the call from the mum who told me they would like to do that, if I am up for it. Since the dad works shifts and the mum works mornings, I will go there every second week starting May 4th! 

I am super excited that I finally get to do what I love again and of course that I will be getting paid again!!

Best night of sleep I've ever had.","I know it's probably just some weird chemical imbalance, but I feel positively **euphoric**. I've become accustomed to waking up a few times in the middle of every night, and oftentimes waking up extremely early (anywhere between 2:30-4:30am) with my mind racing, being unable to fall back asleep at all, so I just start my day. And without fail, no matter when I wake up, I feel like absolute garbage and it takes a while for me to feel normal (let alone excited about my day).

But this morning... I don't know what it is! I went to bed around 9pm and woke up right at 6am and I have an incredible amount of energy. I didn't wake up AT ALL and didn't feel glued to my bed. It's the most perfect night of sleep I've ever had.

Now I'm just trying to figure out everything I did to make this happen... it was pretty cool, so that helped. I had a normal, nutritious dinner about 3 hours before going to sleep. I still had a good amount of screentime before bed, but nothing insanely stimulating/distracting.

We met in real life, but a lot has gotten in the way; school changes, kinda, but her mom used to discriminate against me for my mental health issues after a teacher gossiped about me behind my back to her. (At the time, I only suffered from severe anxiety, which her mom claimed was not real, and profiled me as a manipulative person) 

 And even though she's eased up on me, I've still spent years watching other people get to do things with my best friend that I couldn't. Sleepovers, movies, parties. Normal teen stuff that I only dreamed of experiencing with somebody. I've had other friends, but most of them were online and didn't work out, and I've been homeschooled for two years.

She specifically told me she wasn't sure we would get to do this with each other in the foreseeable future, but today she got off work early unbeknownst to her (still super controlling) mom and came over!

My goal in life has always been to own and operate my own restaurant and today that dream came true. Over a year ago one of my best friends (who already owns his families restaurant) decided we wanted to go in together on a restaurant together. With him already being in the business and me wanting to get in the business we set out to make it happen. We had a plan to start small with a catering contract through a large local company where we would prepare daily meals for there meetings but when Covid hit that plan came to a screeching halt due to them switching to work from home. Shortly after that the opportunity to buy a place owned by a friend of both of our families came up. We jokingly said hey let’s buy it then soon realized we actually could. Over the past six months we worked on making the deal happen and after working secretly to do so in our spare time it has finally happened. The down payment has been made and the switch over will start in just a few short weeks. I could not be happier to do follow my dream with one of my best friends.",Throwaway-4894,self.happy,1592630251

I even found a pair that was looser than the others lol... 

This is so important to me, because at some point when I weighted more than (83 kg), all I could fit were elastic pants, the ones that stretch out, and I had only one pair, so imagine the struggle... 

I'm still overweight (73 kg) in relation to my height (154 cm). But I won't stop here, since I reached this motivating milestone, I'm ready more than ever to continue my journey !

It always made sense to me, but I just realized something that highlighted how true it is.

I started dating my very first girlfriend my junior year of high school, she was a senior. She was my sister's good friend, and when my sister went off to college we started talking, and soon I asked her out. I think I knew even at the time that the odds were completely against this relationship. She was the number 1 student in her class, destined for Ivy League. I had another year at school left, and we would likely if we stayed together a whole year be doomed to a 4 year long term relationship if we tried to make it work.

I went with my heart, and we were madly in love for the next year, but of course it ended after she went away. I ended up breaking up with her, but we both new it was coming. I think I narrowly beat her to the punch. It broke my heart and hers, and at the time I regretted ever letting myself fall in love.

11 years later, and I just thought about her for the first time in God knows how long, months, years. However, I realize my perspective is totally changed. I don't remember what the pain felt like. I don't remember missing her, and I certainly don't miss her now. I don't feel the echo of a hole that was left in my life all those year ago, all those relationships ago. 

The only thing I can really remember is the enormous love I felt for her. How sweet and cute she was. Our first kiss, her laying her head on my shoulder or my chest. Laughing until we couldn't breathe (I have no idea about what).The joy I felt sneaking out to meet her, and laying in a field under the stars all night talking about everything we wanted to do. It was so pure and uncomplicated, I haven't spoken to her in probably 10 years, I have no idea where she lives, what she does, what her life is, but she is still a part of me and it's a good part.

Hey, Reddit,

after  almost 3 years of development my first app is now finished and will be  released soon in the App Store. I could not be prouder.

Name  of the app is turning point. It combines several apps into one.  Habittracker, calendar, moodtracker and a daily journal + statistics.

I  came up with the idea of the app because it annoyed me to have to use  several apps for my daily organization. Habit tracker for habits,  calendar for appointments, reminders for trivial things (shopping etc.),  mood tracker and diary.

I also had a normal success journal on paper, but I couldn't follow my development there or at least it was very time consuming.

Besides, the number of apps slowly went into the money.

I'm convinced that if you use the app every day, your life will improve significantly.

At least this is already the case in my life. :-)

We  also built in a vision board at the beginning, which asks you about  your life goals, annual goals, 3-month goals and monthly goals and which  daily habits you can implement to achieve your goals. These are then  added to your daily dashboard and you can see them at a glance along  with your appointments and normal trivial tasks.

We  call the app ""Wendepunkt"" - which means turning point in english.  Wendepunkt because it can really change your life for the better.

Each  of these habits that ""pays in"" to one of your goals, we call turning  points, because they bring you closer to your true self. Anyone who has  read James Clear knows about the power of habits and small steps.

You can assign the turning points in 7 areas of your life to ensure that you maintain an even balance between the areas.

Because what good is a million dollars in your bank account if your relationships are bad?

The 7 categories are:

* Physis
* Emotions
* Lifetime
* Relations
* Career / Vision
* Finances
* Spirituality

There are also 6 daily questions that ask you about your day and your plans for the day. 3 in the morning and 3 in the evening. 

What you are thankful for, and what you have learned. In this journal you also record your mood, how you felt that day.

Once a week you will receive 3 more questions that will give you more depth and help you reflect on your life.

In  each month you can see in which of the seven areas of your life you  have developed. At the beginning you determine your starting point in  the vision board, how you are doing in the 7 areas of life.

I  am honest. I would never have thought that this ""small"" project would  be so elaborate, but the logic and conception was much more extensive  than I thought.

For now the app is only available in German, but we plan to launch it in other languages as soon as possible.

I know, the app is far from being perfect, but it is honest. :-)

I'm curious if the app will be well received and if it will be able to cover a demand on the need of people.

Let me know your thoughts.

You  could find Screenshots and Impressions on our website. Sorry that is  all in german, but i guess the purpose of the app will be visible.

happy,(19M) About to work my first 60+ Hr week during Christmas holiday period yet I couldn’t be happier with my life.,"I’m a student currently on break from university and have picked up two jobs to work my ass off over (where I live) our christmas holiday period. 

The title states that I couldn’t be happier with my life- as of right now- and it is the complete truth. This isn’t relevant to my work- yet it is relevant to my mental health. 

The past 3 years I found myself struggling with severe depression, whether it be on and off, or constant. I was incredibly suicidal during my days in high school, and even when I moved on from what I thought was affecting me the most- I was never content with my life

This was up until recently, where I have been notified of my acceptance into my chosen profession, have been productive through the picking up of multiple jobs, engaging in physical exercise almost everyday of the week (including  walking) and made an (personally) imperative decision to rid the social media apps from my phone (insta, snapchat, fb) and forming tighter bonds with people I care about whilst simultaneously removing the toxic from my life. Doing the latter significantly reduced my exposure to the pessimism and negativity that is utterly and undeniably prevalent throughout our social media and thus overall increased my overall wellbeing and contributed to my levels of happiness

As the title claims, I am about to work my first 60hr week yet the stresses I once thought I couldn’t manage are miniscule because my mental health is significantly better and I can now claim I am a happy person. I do not recall the last time I personally felt this way. 

I felt the need to make this post because I feel incredibly grateful that I am currently at this stage in my life- and need to proclaim that no matter how much life may suck at a point in your life- there will always be light at the end of the tunnel. Figuring out what makes up happy as individuals is a part of our life journey and as of right now i’m in pursuit of everything that can do such for me. 


(Unrelated but kinda related note- I want to share the love with the reddit community- particularly r/happy as the wholesome and joyous content is infectious and always puts a smile on my face. This is the stuff I want to see and hear about in my life.)

Much love everyone

happy,My best friends are dating and I’m so happy for them!!!,"My two best friends, he’s a fantastic guy who was my (now) husband’s college roommate, he became my roommate and a great friend. She’s been my friend since the beginning of college. 

This has been a long time coming. I’ve shipped them longer than Ross and Rachel or Jim and Pam. He told her he liked her and she said “let’s just be friends.” We had beers as I told him she’s picky and she didn’t know him that well. Then for months she kept inviting him “as friends” to stuff. I could seem him suffering so I told her it was cruel and to give him time to “get over” her.

For years since we’ve all been friends and though they weren’t super close they always got along with ease. I kept inviting them as the “singles pair” to our parties and dinners, always making sure it was ok/wouldn’t be awkward. He moved to another state but visited frequently. Our other (non mutual) friends started inviting him to all our events.

Years pass, I get married, he’s my husband’s best man, she’s my bridesmaid. Flirting happens between them, I find out later. I say, why didn’t anything happen? She says, it wasn’t meant to be...it would be too weird...it would ruin the friendship. I tell her she’s being an idiot that they have tons in common (he’s taken up many new hobbies that she shares) but that she’s not allowed to break his heart. That she can’t just try out dating him casually (like she has other guys) that she should be ready to settle down cuz he’s worth it. She decides she’s not interested, or does she?

For two years she goes back and forth, continues to see other guys but none really click. We have a late night convo and I suggest she consider him: to really interrogate her feelings and what she wants from life. 

We hang out (me, husband, him, her) the day after thanksgiving. That night (after we leave) she finally suggests they start dating. They talk for hours. They’ve seen each other every weekend since. I was oblivious.

Tonight she called me and told me, “it’s not weird, it’s actually really, really good.” He’s over the moon. He says I can help him find a job back in our home state. I won’t tell them I’m planning their (hypothetical) wedding. NO PRESSURE guys!! Even if they don’t get a happily ever after, I’m still glad they’re giving it a chance.",patiencerunning,self.happy,1545107720

happy,I just officially finished my first full-time semester in college after a year and a half away. And I passed all my classes!!!,"When I started college, my mental health issues got 10x worse out of nowhere. After only one semester, I started withdrawing from my classes. I'd enroll, stick it out for a few weeks, then withdraw. I lost my financial aid because of a poor completion rate. I worked shitty jobs with hours that killed me. My diet went to shit because I never had any motivation to cook for myself, and my jobs always had sweets around for the taking. I have severe ADHD as it is (genuinely, I'm diagnosed), but the combination of sleep deprivation and poor nutrition just sent me straight to rock bottom. There were days that I had such a hard time concentrating that it was *physically uncomfortable* to try and read words on a screen.

Late last year, I started working at the worst job I've ever had in my life. I dreaded going to work every day. I was scared of my boss. It was the kick I needed to get me back in school and start following that dream I had for myself. 

And I fucking did it, guys. First I started with just a couple classes, but this was my first full-time semester back in school and I did it. I finished. It was really, really hard and some of the subjects I took were not exactly my strongest. BUT I DID IT. I'm even more excited for next semester, I'm taking some really fun classes. In the summer, I'm going to graduate and go on to university.

I THINK I'M GONNA GET A DEGREE YOU GUYS. I'm a first generation college student, and I will be literally the second person in my WHOLE family to get a degree.

happy,Today I celebrate one year without purging.,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share this because I just realized it's been one year since I've purged. For those who don't know, purging is a word used by people with Eating Disorders to reference anything done to get rid of ""excess"" calories. In may case, it was throwing up.

I grew up as an overweight kid, which caused a lot of self-esteem issues and was generally uncomfortable, and eventually, around 14 years old, I started throwing up to get rid of excess calories. At first, frankly, because I felt so bloated from eating so much but eventually, it became just an easy way to ""clean the slate"" after binging. 

Thankfully, around 17 years old, I lost a ton of weight and along it, my bulimia, or at least the behavior. I was also obsessed with working out (I remember going for a 10km jog at 10 PM under the rain in November in Canada) and constantly dieting. Frankly, I felt fat. This was clearly unsustainable and the moment I had my first midterms, I started binging again and that freaked me out because I didn't want to be overweight again so I started purging.

Eventually, I balooned back to where I was in a very short amount of time and even hit new records. The accessibility of food and the fact I could hide in my apartment alone while doing so made it so easy, and I was in a pit. My whole life was centered around food. It was affecting my relationship, my studies, everything. I felt controlled by food, and still feel like that today. I was miserable.

Every week I told myself it'll be different. That I'll finally work on all this and get out of it. Start getting better. I begged myself to. And every week, I ended up binging and throwing up again to the point that whenever I told myself, ""new week, new chance"", I would immediately think, ""Just like the weeks before and what changed since then?"" And frankly, I was right. There was no reason why it would be different.

It came to a point that three years after starting university, I called my father crying saying I hit rock bottom and that if I didn't do something, I was going to ruin my life. I had always been scared of telling my Dad because I was scared of disappointing him but to my surprise, he was very supportive. In fact, he told me he faced similar issues in College which was great to hear, not because I want anyone else to have Bulimia, but because I see him as my role model and if he could do it, so can I.

Anyway, I decided to see a therapist since then, which has helped me tremendously. My therapist was just incredible and made me realized so many things. But mostly, she took me seriously and she didn't judge me. Like at all. I spend my life judging me, saying how I'm a bad guy and x and y, so it was such a relief to have her tell me that I'm not.

And then one day, I stopped binging. And the days started piling up to today, which added up to a year. I finally realized that the harm I was doing to myself throwing up was much greater than the harm of weight gain. The most interesting part is that even though I came to my therapist for my eating disorder, I don't recall once where we actually discussed. It was a true eye opener when she pointed that out.

I've yet to stop binging and so, have gained weight during this year since I didn't throw up, but I definitely feel on the way of dealing with that, too. My binges are much smaller and less frequent. And I've already lost 15 kg from my heaviest weight (this summer). Although even at my heaviest, I was, in average, happier and better in my skin than I ever was at my lightest. 

Thank you for reading. I just wanted to share because I give myself a lot of sh\*t for not being better as I forget how far I've come. Hope this helps some of you guys.",ACuriousFrenchie,self.happy,1545012591

happy,"After so many years, life is finally going the right way, despite the problems that I'm having.","For once, it feels like my life is going the right way.

After years and years of trial and error, my doctor and I have found medications that actually work with my depression and anxiety. I finally feel like the person that I am supposed to be. After a decade, another doctor and I have finally found a medication that works with my seizures; I am three months seizure-free, and three months away from finally being able to drive again. I will finally be able to search for a job, maybe an actual career that I enjoy. I have an amazing seven month old who I would do anything and everything for. I've been married for three years to an awesome husband who, even though we do have our fights and battles, compliments me personality-wise. I'm no longer worried about my weight and constantly checking the scale, but I am eating a lot more healthy and being a lot more active. I no longer feel self-conscious about my looks or my partial paralysis. Let people see me in my AFO (foot brace), or carrying the small pool noodle in my right hand to loosen up my fingers-- anyone who judges me solely based on those factors isn't worth my time. I actually feel attractive to guys-- not that I would ever do anything, but just the feeling definitely boosts my ego. 

I may not be in the best situation right now. I'm in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, in a rental house that definitely needs a lot of fixing.

happy,"Happily Found The Two Loves Of My Life, I Can't Stop Thinking How Lucky I Am","I met my husband online when I was 15 (2011), I found and reached out to him on a chatting website not meant for dating. During that time I was in a very emotionally/mentally abusive relationship with a controlling man who pratically had me in tears every single day. My soon to be husband helped me get out of that hell and I started to date him. We texted and Skyped almost everyday for a year before he drove four hours to come meet me and my parents for two hours before driving back. From that moment I no longer had to hide him from my parents and I was able to visit once a year. In 2014 I graduated High School and moved those four hours to be with him. In 2014 I got the flu terribly bad and I have never been that well taken care of and worried for. I got better and although our financial issues haven't been the best we moved into a better apartment in November 2015. On September 13, 2017 we got married in a courthouse and I officially became his wife. This man is my soul mate and I don't ever doubt that for a second, we are one.

We had to physically seperate for a bit because of financial issues but in this time we had wonderful personal growth. I got on anti depressants, lost weight, and we both better understood one another even stating we are both into polyamory.

 I found a lovely girl online recently and can happily say I have a girlfriend who I love so dearly and passionately. Soon we will go on our first date and within a couple months I can see her a couple times a week ♡ She encourages me to push myself and is already helping me better my body. She is making me a better woman and I want to be that for her more than anything.

I'm just sitting back thanking the universe at the happiness I have and the happiness I have waiting for me four hours away. My heart is full of love and smile seems to permanently paint my face.",ShinnoMew,self.happy,1544958722

I've gained confidence and I dont care about approval from other people. Fuck being sad, fuck being depressed, life is too fucking short. It's what my parents would have wanted. They wouldn't want me feeling down and sorry for myself. 

I grew up in an abusive home and was sexual assaulted, abused physically at 4 years up to 16 years of age. I'm 21 now and I'm not gonna let my abuser take me down. I'm a grown man and I'm gonna live my life like every day is the last.

You gotta conquer the day! Like a warrior. I have the mindset of a soldier. I'll never give up and I'll keep pushing till the day I croak. I used to skinny as hell but I've been working out hardcore and got buffed up.

Loving yourself is Key to true happiness. Life is precious and I'll enjoy every second for now on! You can all be happy! Be confident and dont care what other people think. Make the world see that you are capable of doing anything!

Nothing is impossible. Happiness is right around the corner. Be the change! Fucking love you guys.",LSDXMT___,self.happy,1608770666

happy,Finally doing what makes me happy by counting my blessings,"I'm a creative type, which might sound great but it's not... Being too creative can also mean lack of focus and follow-through. It can mean chasing that new shiny thing and not sticking to what I truly is my purpose in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done many things that seemed like a good idea. At some of them I was quite successful, but most of them a failure, and almost all of them didn't really bring me lasting happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that I always noticed I'm doing is obsessively envying and comparing - Why can't I have this or that? Why am I not earning enough, like him or her? Which also meant that I've done many things out of the wrong reasons - prestige and financial reward.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been searching for a new path for years now, and yesterday I started something that truly feels me with joy. Whether it succeeds or not - that's yet to be seen, but it does make me happy, and maybe that's what's most important.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, that thing is about combating my natural envy by writing about everything I'm actually rich with - things that I should just spend more time appreciating rather than chasing what I think I want.

&amp;#x200B;

So whether this remains my modest personal journal, or helps others like me - I'm happy that I'm doing it.",saarshai,self.happy,1608745807

happy,"I am beyond blessed this year, and I needed to say it somewhere more anonymous than my social media!","This year has been so hard for so many people, that to be honest, I feel kinda guilty saying just how amazing this year has been for me.  But 2020 has been just...an incredible year in my life.

First off, I was officially hired by a company I started working with through a temp agency.  I'm now their marketing director, and love this company, the people that own and run it, and the people I get to work with on a daily basis.  This place has been incredibly accommodating as I've made a bunch of other super positive changes in my life, and the owner is so supportive of me and and my work that it's been such an incredible pleasure to be part of this place.  For the first time ever, I can imagine working somewhere until I retire, and it will definitely be this place!

Second, I and my partner worked hard on our relationship to make it stronger than ever.  My fiancee is absolutely amazing and I love her so much!  We've had some serious rocky times, but now we're finally reaching a good stable point in our life together, and in our respective personal lives.  I can't imagine my life without her, and it feels so amazing to love someone so completely who returns that same love and devotion!

Third, I bought a house!!  It's a perfect starter home, and yes, I'm TOTALLY bragging about it!  2 bed, 2 bath, with an attached 2 car garage and a detatched workshop with 1.5 acres of land, all fenced in, and they even put a brand new 30-year roof on it right before closing.  I can't get over how lucky I feel about that, and I'm still basking in the glow of new home ownership.  It's insane!

Fourth, definitely not least, but I started taking better care of my mental health, which is definitely what contributed to a lot of the great things that happened this year.  I'm getting my bipolar disorder taken care of, and I'm finally sleeping longer than 4 hours a night for the first time in years.  Please, if you're struggling with anxiety, mental health problems, sleeplessness, just anything that contributes to you not feeling your best, PLEASE go see someone!  Get the help you need, and I promise you'll see improvements in other areas of your life.  Maybe not immediately, but at least you'll be more clear-headed and feel better.  Life is so beautiful, and you deserve to have it!

And finally, my finances are finally - incredibly - in a position where I was ABLE to buy a house!  Money in savings, working on rebuilding my 401k, my small business on the side has grown a lot, and I'm just...I'm feeling so incredibly blessed and feel like all of the hardships in my life helped me get to this point.  I know there's still a long, long way to go, and that things can always go wrong, but I'm choosing to focus on the good right now.  I just feel stable for the first time in my entire life, like I can finally breathe a little, and I've never felt like that, so I'm just going to soak it up!

I'm sorry this was so long.  Usually at the end of each year, I look back and get upset at how much I didn't accomplish, or I look forward at all of the hurdles ahead of me.  It's such a change to feel like I have things to actually want to happen, and to actually look at the previous year as the Year I Got Shit Done.

This year, he wanted things like: a real metal slinky, some science kits, some dinosaur eggs that hatch in water, a Toblerone bar, and (of course), the little robot toy. ""But I know it's expensive, so even if I don't get it, it's okay! I will still be happy!"" He's only 7.. I don't want him saying things like that.

I just finished putting up lights, a wreath, and some garland to decorate the house. I was never able to before due to money and health, but I can now!!!! We will also go pick out a small artificial tree together this week and decorate it together with homemade ornaments. He LOVES seeing Christmas lights &amp; decorations when we drive around, and has always wanted to decorate the house. I cannot wait until he gets home from school today!!

And on Christmas, he will wake up to a little electric train (cliche, I know.. but he never had anything like this before!! And he loves trains!!) and a pile of gifts on our table. And, little does he know, he will get everything he wants and SO much more!!

I can hardly wait. (:",MagikarpIsBest,self.happy,1544460401

happy,I don't even care I'm working 80 hour weeks because I love my job.,"Preface, I'm not great at writing so apologies on the rambly nature of this. 


I've never really felt like I've belonged to a group of people, I've had a few friends here or there throughout my early teens. And I'm grateful of that. (although less grateful of a lot of my fellow peers, but that another story)

On starting college (16-18 yrs in the uk) I thought my life would remain fairly the same but little did I know. I very quickly found myself surrounded by some of the most awesome friends I could hope for. I quickly learned how to become a somewhat normal member of society and went to a few parties and even had a girlfriend for a few months which was honestly an amazing few months. Fortunately we parted on good terms and are still very good friends now.

I honestly don't know what my life would be like without this awesome group of people, potentially I wouldn't even be here. But again, that's a story for another day. 

However, after finishing college I took a gap year before university while all but one of them went to uni or got full time jobs. And for the first few weeks I felt myself really missing them, I loved being able to come in and be able to be around these people. It just made me happy. Which is something I don't find comes easily.

Going back to just over a year ago I started a new job at the local theatre and entertainment venue as a casual hours technician. I knew I'd prefer this job to my previous one (retail work, very much not for me. I only lasted 8 weeks).

It has taken almost a year to get used to it, getting to know the team and build relationships with my coworkers and manager. I still don't think anyone there would describe me as chatty but I'm able to have conversations with them and not feel like I'm lost (which was certainly the case with my retail job)

For the last month or so we have been very busy, with it being Christmas there are lots of Christmas parties in the function rooms and we have been manically setting up and rehearsing for the pantomime. As a consequence I've been racking up some serious hours. (and some serious paychecks too!)

Just this week I've worked 6 out of 7 days and have done over 80 hours. Any sane person would be done by this point, but I'm not. I can't wait for the rest of December!

I really have found a home for my gap year, a group of people I see every day, can have a good laugh with and enjoy myself (while getting paid too!)
I even seem to have made a few friends and we are going to Lego land next week on the only day we don't have any panto shows.

I don't always enjoy life, I'm hardly someone who's always happy - if fact it used to be almost never - and I'll become pretty sad quite easily. (I also struggle with mental health issues, but have yet to have any formal diagnosis. But I am working on that too, trying to better understand myself and deciding on what I should do to help move forward) Work however gives some joy (actually quite a lot to be honest) to my life I otherwise wouldn't have, and I'm incredibly thankful of that. And of the people that help make it possible.

I do worry consistently about going off to university next year, having to start from ground zero again trying to find another - hopefully - awesome group of people to spend time with. And trying to carry on doing work in an industry I love, but would never pursue professionally. But I've still got 9 more months before that's a reality I'll need to face. And hopefully those months will be as enjoyable as the last few have been. ",OverclockingUnicorn,self.happy,1544402109

(I luckily has a friend who took me and my daughter in last year) It has been hell, emotionally and physically to say the least. 

During this time no one could give me a diagnosis. I bounced from doctor to doctor, specialist to specialist, with no solid answers. They new it was autoimmune, knew it was chronic inflammation, but couldn’t pin point it. I finally was referred to a new rheumatologist in my area in November this year. During the first appointment diagnosed me with seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis. I cried in joy, I finally KNEW what was wrong with me. With this diagnosis came the new meds I could try. It took a month for the insurance to approve them but they finally did and I started my first injection on Wednesday. I knew it could take 3 months or so to kick in so I wasn’t expecting immediate results. But here we are. My red face has calmed down so much, I have lost 5 lbs already and have had 2 moments of feeling perfectly comfortable.

happy,This subreddit makes me so happy and wholesome and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.,"Hi everyone,

\[Some backstory\] I'm a 20 year old guy mostly been lonely throughout my entire life maybe because of my shyness, overthinking and being super introvert right start from the beginning. Don't get me wrong I've a great family that cares for me at each and every step of my life, didn't smoke or took drugs at any point of my life (though many people transformed from that phase of their life and I'm super happy for them). More or less, I'm a lonely guy who mostly spends his entire day in front of laptop and phone, made some friends(very good friends) during my high-school and lost contact with all of them mostly due to distance and lack of communication even though I' haven't forgotten them. A very few of them do message like once in 6 months complaining that I've forgotten them and don't care anymore of them which is not totally true. I did make some good friends in my college but I don't get along with them so well. I mostly scroll on Reddit finding content that makes me happy. Scrolling mostly r/aww, r/GirlsMirin, r/MadeMeSmile, r/HumanBeingBros and maybe r/wholesomememes looking for posts that make me warm and happy. Today, I found out this subreddit and it just made the past hour that I've been into it even though I cried seeing some of the posts. Mostly scrolled thru the best posts of all time and upvoted mostly all of them that I could cos Reddit archives old posts. This was actually a very good time that I spent even though it was like 1-1.5 hrs but it still made my Sunday and will make in the future. I just want to say thanks to the people who made this subreddit so that different people can connect with each other and share some wholesome moments. And maybe, I'll overcome loneliness in my life and become happy for the rest of my life just like others and get a job after I complete my college.

tl;dr: Just thanking the people who made this subreddit and others like this one for a guy who has been mostly lonely his entire life. ",sxnaprkhr3012,self.happy,1544380023

While I was laying down, a little girl, probably around 5 years old, walked by with her dad. While she walked by, she made a casual remark that improved my mood a hundred fold.

happy,I think I just broke my depressive state!,"I do online school, and I suffer from a huge amount of procrastination, and I was in a very depressive state from before today.

Today, I talked with my teachers, did some research on combating procrastination and how to live a healthier life, and I'm starting to practice it.

I have friends who care about me and I care about, a girl I have a very strong connection with, I just did so many assignments on my schooling that it felt fun, and I'm now going to meditate and go to bed. I also get my very first paycheck this week and I am beyond excited to give my family gifts and enjoy the feeling of giving.

I'm free from the wretches of depression, I feel good and like myself again. I like my job, I now beat procrastination, and I have strong connections with people. I really took my life for granted.

I just wanted to share how giddy and happy I am at the moment. Thanks for reading! 😄",DrDaree,self.happy,1543998555

happy,"I was unable to accept the fact that I had a lot of mental health issues that were taking a toll on my life and relationships, but today is the day that changes and I’m so happy to start the journey to getting better!","today is the day I get better. today is the day I take responsibility for my health and responsibility for relationships, the day I try to begin to fix the relationships I’ve ruined. today is the day I begin to grow up. today is the day I start allowing myself to work towards being happy. today is the day I start new. I already begin the long route to healing one relationship that I’ve so drastically ruined and I know it can’t be how it was before, and now I’m actually okay with that being the outcome. Bad things have happened to me in my life, but letting them control my life and letting them tear me down and apart from the inside out. today is the day I start building a better life. just being able to accept that I have problems is a step forward and gives me so much hope!!
