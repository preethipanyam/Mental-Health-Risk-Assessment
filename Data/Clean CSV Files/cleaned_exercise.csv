Exercise,thekielbasastore,self.Exercise,2021-09-17 15:35:23,should i lose fat first or build muscle first  i am   and  lbs according to my bmi this makes me just a bit overweight  body fat percentage is   which is fine but by no means indicative of any great fitness level i would imagine a healthy weight would be around     anyway i want to put on   lbs of muscle putting my final ideal weight at around   should i put on the muscle first hit   and then try to lose the  lbs or would it be easier to focus solely on losing the  lbs now and then add muscle after i d imagine it would be easier to do things with full range of motion if i had less weight so i m leaning towards the second option but i d be curious to hear what people think if you have any similar experience

Exercise,mariolink93,self.Exercise,2021-09-17 09:16:15,new to consistent exercise did i over do it  so for a while now i have been wanting to get into shape its been a long time since i ve had an active life style   years and felt that it was time to change i went out and bought a smart treadmill and installed it in my garage and started my fitness journey   i started jogging walking  miles every day except for sundays for  month total i made sure i had a good stretch  minutes before and after my sessions on the treadmill it was going great and i was working up a sweat every time i felt good and it was going smoother than i had imagined it would i was watching my calorie intake making sure i had enough carbs and protein for fuel and making sure that i was always hydrated all the time   after this one month passed of me exercising consistently i can feel fatigue in my legs calfs i can get out of and into bed fine but walking for a decent period of time and attempting to go for my usual jog walk on the treadmill is impossible right now  no matter what position i am in whether its standing or sitting for a long period of time it feels like my legs are shaky weak i can feel it especially in my thighs and for a short period of time it felt like i had shin splints that eventually went away but the fatigue in my legs is still present and slowing me down so i was wondering if i over did it with the amount and pace i started at has anyone else experienced something like this before

Exercise,Jcorb,self.Exercise,2021-09-15 12:10:37,are stationary bikes  or electric bikes  an effective way to burn calories  right now i m in a bit of a rut i go to work then go home that s about it i can t use the gym at work anymore they re still requiring people to book time slots to protect against covid  and there s only one gym within  min of my house  and it seems mainly dedicated to being a yoga space no real weights or anything   for reasons beyond this i m considering moving but have considered either investing in a stationary bike or possibly an electric bike hear me out before dismissing it    honestly my only goal right now is weight loss so burning calories is great but just as important for me  is just time spent doing something  that isn t thinking about eating i ve never been in great health but i ve definitely noticed that the more bored i am the more i tend to snack  i ve gotten rid of pretty much all that type of food but i feel like i need some sort of mental stimulation   the other idea i ve considered is picking up an electric bike the idea honestly never crossed my mind until a coworker of mine was talking about it and mentioning he feels way better i sort of laughed at first thinking don t those things basically ride themselves  and his response that he only really uses the electric part of it when he s going up particularly difficult hills or if he s been riding all day and just feels exhausted   he made kind of a compelling case for it that when he had a normal bike he only went for a ride once or twice a month but because the electric bike deals with the hard stuff  he s actually going riding pretty much every day because it s so much more enjoyable particularly if i wind up moving back down south near my family i could also see something like that being useful for my father who has back issues but really needs some amount of light exercise   i mean at least with the electric bike at the very least it provides some amount of entertainment value  for a stationary bike though i m unsure how useful those are for actively burning calories or if that s just an expense that s realistically unlikely to make much if an impact on my actual weight loss journey

Exercise,Being_Honest-,self.Exercise,2021-08-18 07:59:43,early morning protein usability hi   something i ve been curious about for some time is the issue of whether protein ingested long before a workout will actually aid in muscle protein synthesis or if it will simply be used for energy   there s information about eating windows online but much of it pertains to whether protein ingested a short time before a workout will aid in growth obviously if you have been working out with weights within  hours of the meal then your body will be a heightened state of protein synthesis inherently so in that case it s easily assumed that protein intake early in the day will aid with that however assume that the individual is untrained or has simply had a few days off training will protein ingested at am aid in muscle growth for that day if the workout doesn t occur until pm

Exercise,JonathanCRH,self.Exercise,2021-08-10 09:44:18,running games  hi everyone   i used to love jogging on the wii fit  well not love  exactly but hate marginally less than other forms of exercise sounds a little negative  it was very simple put the controller in your pocket and its accelerometer would determine your approximate jogging speed as you ran on the spot with your avatar running through a much nicer world than the one you were actually in   that was fourteen years ago but i can t find anything that comes close today the closest i can find is zwift but leaving aside the fact that it s littered with endless menus and lists of stats and is clearly aimed at serious people who do lots of running cycling you have to buy a pretty expensive foot pod to actually make your avatar run at the speed you re jogging at i have a treadmill my wife s anyway  but zwift s own foot pods seem to be permanently out of stock and alternative ones are hopelessly expensive   there s an app that promises to get around this treadmill smart speed which you put on your phone and then use the phone like the wii fit controller of old sending your running speed via bluetooth to zwift running on another device this is exactly what i want except that it doesn t work it doesn t register my speed most of the time when it does it has a huge lag and it sends the speed to zwift only intermittently   so this is my question i want an experience like wii fit jogging where you put a phone or something similar in your pocket and a character on your tv screen runs through a virtual environment accordingly ideally i d like it to be something simple enough for a small child to use  just like wii fit itself does anything like this exist on any platform or are we stuck endlessly running round wiifitty island for ever more

Exercise,chriscorf,self.Exercise,2020-10-08 01:57:38,help me come up with a long term plan to get healthy hi everyone please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on   i have been unhealthy for quite some time now no exercise and eating a lot of fast food  i have decided it s time to change i have tried to start working out many times before every time i try i tell myself i will take it easy in the beginning so i don t get burnt out but when i am nearing the end of my first work out i think fuck it i am already working out might as well push myself as hard as i can  and i do so but then i am completely unmotivated to keep going the next day and just quit  i am in no hurry to get a shape i just want something that will keep me healthy in the remaining approximately  years of my life i am  f  so i had the idea to start with something ridiculously easy the first day but make it harder over time an example would be to do  push up a day on days  and  and every other day i increse it by  so in a years time i would be doing more than   push ups a day and i don t see how i would end up quitting i can for example set a maximum and once i hit that maximum i will stop increasing it i am interested to see what peope think about this plan and any tips you have i have some specific questions as well    should i focus on just one thing like push ups or should i have some variety for example let s say on a particlar day my number was at   then i could do  push ups and  sit ups for example   is it important that i spend some time in the beginning before starting figuring out how to do these exercises with the correct form at the moment i am pretty much clueless about form for push ups sit ups etc   which exercise or exercises would you recommend i do i don t have any specific goals like building muscle or anything i just want to make sure i don t die early haha   what is a suitable maximum i realise of course this depends on which exercise or exercises i choose to do   should i take break days or perhaps days where i do less than usual for example rather than going                     etc i could do                    etc   i would prefer to pick something that is easy to just knock out whenever i want like for example while i am cooking i could knock out a few push ups then later in the day i could do another few etc will it be fine to spread it throghout the day rather than doing it all in one session   thank you so much in advance for any feedback

Exercise,Jida-polysavoir99,self.Exercise,2020-10-03 03:59:38,i need your help getting started in exercise pretty much the title hello everyone hope you are doing well   i m going to post a little background about myself and my fitness goals i ll also post my concerns and what s holding me back from starting any advice for some or all of the categories will be greatly appreciated here goes   what i want to start with a realistic fitness goal  nothing over the top probably  minutes for   days a week as i imagine rest days are needed  i want to do a multiple different exercises a program for example push ups stretches of some sort followed by lunges i don t know that require no equipment except the floor and walls  i also prefer to exercise alone speaking of no equipment    where i prefer to do my exercises completely at home hence no gym equipment the park is ok as well when the weather is nice i just don t like gyms the distance the ambiance the cost the sweat on the equipment thinking about where to store my stuff the people i m somewhat antisocial hur hur  it just does nothing for me   how this is where i need your help i need your help as to which equipmentless exercises i can do at home perhaps  or  different types that i can do in a row for a grand total of  minutes    desired result i don t expect nor desire to be jacked like the stereotypical bodybuilder  i suppose i want a lean or somewhat toned look if that makes sense i m currently skinny in both the arms legs with legs being much stronger  i have a very slight gut but i want it to be a least flat in the end i want to feel more energetic and stronger in the upper body arms  though i ll train the lower body too obviously  i m a guy in his mid twenties for context   my experiences with exercise my experiences have ranged from meh to mediocre indifferent at best in high school and college i have tried various weight training programs with little reward while i ve achieved short term results while i was in enrolled in such programs i wouldn t go back to the gym when the mandatory programs ended i don t know i just didn t enjoy using weight training equipment i liked how i felt afterwards sometimes yeah but it always felt like a chore  the coronavirus also doesn t encourage me to go to an enclosed space where everyone is rapidly breathing no thanks   conversely i plunged myself into tai chi for a short period and really enjoyed it the reason i don t do it now is the lack of a structure or teacher and being lazy   the only current exercises i do regularly is long walks everywhere i have no car  i also stretch but only for a few minute intervals when i need to feel better after working on my computer for a while   things holding me back    too many choices and conflicting information the number of exercises available is numerous worse still the advice that follows is of often confusing and conflicts with other advice looking this shit up is mentally taxing i m also confused by the various definitions methods blalabla    diet modifications i typically eat in moderation and avoid junk food no problem there i m mostly concerned as to how much stuff i have to add if i start working out do i need to learn new recipes how many servings of this or that do i simply add protein to the dishes i already know should i drink a protein powder which is often expensive  ugh     lack of structure i don t want to go to a gym  maybe i can read your exercise suggestions and search them on youtube i don t want to half ass it without knowing if it s getting me to my fitness goals or not i also want suggestions for how many reps or sets for each exercise if possible    i don t enjoy it i m trying to change this attitude tai chi gave me this sense of hope perhaps other equipmentless exercises can do the same i see the benefits have genuinely enjoyed it a bit before and wish to take the plunge     fear of improper training lastly i fear that i ll exercise unevenly if that makes sense i don t want to focus excessively on one muscle area over another as i risk the injury and akwardness that comes from an unevenly developed body hence those skip a leg day jokes online  i don t know how much time or what exercises to dedicate to which part of the body hench the confusing and conflicting information that come from the fitness world   sorry for the long text i just hope i was as clear as possible in my text thanks again

Exercise,No_Mither_No_Problem,self.Exercise,2020-09-26 13:14:07,i experimented with a shorter higher intensity cardio workout today and i m not sure how i feel  around last week i started making a commitment to visit the gym regularly for cardio workouts for most of it i ve been doing mildly brisk walks    mph on moderate inclines      for  minutes   today i felt dissatisfied with how low my heart rate was so i switched to  mph at inclines from   to  with longer active intervals and shorter rest intervals over a  minute period i m not fit so  mph is a jog for me meaning this was considerably more intense   my peak heart rate for this exercise was about  to  bpm higher than my  minute one and my average heart rate was about  bpm higher   i was satisfied with that but i was unsatisfied with the fact that i couldn t keep that pace up for longer than a minute or two and had to lower the intensity in broken irregular intervals mostly because something is wrong with my left leg that makes it tired very quickly when walking or running   because of this i was left conflicted i wasn t sure if i was pushing myself too hard or if i wasn t pushing myself hard enough though i was tired and sweaty after the session i still felt like i could keep going and wanted to but i m not sure if that s because i actually could or if it was just runner s high   i m not quite sure what to do going forward and was wondering if any cardio enthusiasts had any advice should i lower the intensity increase the duration should i switch back to the  minute one for now should i cycle between them

Exercise,midekinrazz420,self.Exercise,2020-09-06 10:15:57,please recommend exercises for someone with a bad knee  my mom is  and has hypertension she could afford to lose  pounds but has a busted knee that is holding her back   she has full control of her knee and it flexes well but has fluid in her knee due to busting something in there we live in spain and the doctors are telling her she s still too young for knee surgery i don t know what the hell they re waiting for a miracle    when we go out for walks she starts to experience pain in her knee around the ten minute mark she s a fighter through and through so you won t hear her complaining but i know she s in pain she has developed a bit of a limp due to this   she does enjoy going out on bike rides however we use the city s electric bikes because they re softer on her knee so i don t know that it s really putting a dent on the weight loss since it s mostly riding for leisure i know any bit of activity is good but she only gets to ride on her free days as she does  hour shifts at the clinics she works in at work she isn t on her feet all the time and she isn t busy all the time she s just on call for whatever patient needs tending to this gives her plenty of free time to do something in her private room to keep her weight under control   yoga and running are mostly out of the picture as most of the poses put a lot of stress on her bad knee and my mom wouldn t be able to kneel for child s pose much less assume a table top position or transition to downward dog and running or walking would just aggravate her knee even more   swimming is a nice option but again i need to show her something she can do every day and not just on her free days   my main goals for her are weight loss and avoid further aggravation of the busted knee   i love my mom and i want to see her get better losing weight would also lift her self esteem and she deserves to feel happy about herself   if anyone here can recommend any exercises that can work around her limitations i d appreciate it very much   thanks for reading my post

Exercise,Whizkeyonetwo,self.Exercise,2020-07-10 00:44:56,question  so i m a fairly heavy guy started running around    weeks ago along along with some weight lifting i run for around    mins i was doing  m relay style jogging but recently i have been trying to improve distance by obviously increasing the distance i run without stopping or walking i had pain resembling shin splints around  weeks in to my running journey and eventually they just went away i ve started getting them again and this time i feel like they are drastically reducing the distance i can run because they are making running a bit painful and just generally more laborious i just wanted to ask people who are more experienced whether this is a recurring thing that happens every now and then and if there is anything i can do to stop or reduce the shin splints is this a result of over exercising and should i just run through them or take a break   long question i know but i need some advice here

Exercise,Not_For_Anyone,self.Exercise,2020-07-01 23:59:43,thinking about finding a gym with a pool  i find excersise boring i would want a gym that has rock wall climbing swimming obstacle courses and all that good stuff instead they have treadmills and dumbbells i can t really complain about all that stuff since i m pretty sure i m in the minority when it comes to my interest not to mention all the people who are older and a typical gym would benefit them more so however a typical gym is boring to me and thus i quit exercising even though it has good results and technically not a waste a time i can t help but consider it a waste of time i could be doing so much more entertaining things   i know some gyms have pools i really like swimming and can swim for hours so i was thinking about doing just that swimming   i ve never been to a gym with a pool so i have some questions is it an empty pool or a pool that has those things that separates each swimmer also i know not to act insane and jump in but will i be able to atleast drive under like a seal scrape the bottom with my stomach and emerge up lastly i have an odd  swimming style when it comes to going fast i swim on the my side with my head under and use one arm both legs and a bit of body sway to push myself forward i win fun races by doing this but i also think my feet aggressively hitting water is causing splashes that s probably how i win so really i m a loser but my question on this one is would you swimmers be angry at my swimming even if you are far away simply be angry at the noise

Exercise,EnvironmentOverWill,self.Exercise,2020-06-28 19:58:03,here s why most people hate working out i believe that the reason most people abhor working out is that humans didn t evolve to deliberately expend energy homo sapiens lived in food scarcity much much longer than we most people in the developed world anyway have lived in food abundance   why does this matter for one thing life is short and our free time limited so why spend it doing something you hate but also research shows that the benefits of exercise are greater if you enjoy the exercise   what can we do about this we can take a tip from the blue zones the regions of the world with the highest life expectancies blue zones author dan buettner likes to shock his audiences by telling them that individuals in the blue zones do not exercise what he means is that they do not work out  instead exercise is built into their day buettner calls it moving naturally  people in the blue zones are shepherds farmers and gardeners they hike miles to visit neighbors they cook without many kitchen appliances kneading bread is good exercise    so there you have it there is no reason to go against our evolutionary grain and deliberately expend energy just move naturally when i realized how much i hate working out i went over my daily routine to find ways that i could replace a task with a more active version i came up with the following    bike to work and errands a bike ride to work takes me about  minutes each way   use a treadmill desk these are expensive so i instead bought a   portable under desk treadmill to use with a makeshift standing desk desk with textbooks under each leg  i can t use it at work though   these activities provide plenty of daily exercise i just need to find a way to integrate arm strengthening into my daily routine lol

Exercise,simoraad,self.Exercise,2020-05-18 12:31:36, ways exercise affects your memory everyone knows exercise is good for you even a little does a lot  but while it s easy to see the physical improvements you may be shocked to learn there are many mental improvements that come with increased movement  here s a list of ways exercise affects your memory     exercise increases oxygen intake in the brain  not only is the brain the seat of awareness it s also the control center for the whole rest of the body people tend to forget no pun intended  that their brain has physical needs like any other organ  oxygen  blood etc that s where even a little bit of exercise can get you some results simply learning to breathe deeply and calmly is enough to increase oxygen intake in the brain which powers the whole system    so  a good workout will not only increase your lung capacity and regulate your insulin levels it will also supercharge your brain capacity so you can go on to do mental things     exercise strengthens neural connections  studies have shown that a form of physical exercise that also incorporates a mental challenge  say ballroom dancing or a team sport  does more for the brain than either plain physical exercise or plain mental exercise such as completing puzzles  while your imagination may be boundless brains are pretty much locked into a finite system    although your brain does grow rapidly in your early years by the time you reach young adulthood you ve pretty much finished the physical  construction as in brain cells  everything you do after that is  simply connecting and reconnecting your neurons to each other to make  new memories and associations you have one set of connecting blocks to  play with if you lose some of them you can t go to the store and buy  more that s why it s vital to keep the ones you have going for as long  as you can and exercise is the key to that    source    ways exercise affects your memory https  www omario online p

Exercise,TheSauvaaage,self.Exercise,2020-05-17 09:29:29,the best and simple home office corona workout period  after  weeks of home office i came up with something solid for you muscle builders and workout freaks out there this is as simple as it can get and requires nothing but adjustable dumbbells plates and a bit of space more explanations further down let s get to the nitty gritty   day  overhead press  pushups  triceps oh extensions  day  upright rows  bent over rows  curls  day  squats  goblet squats  air squats  day  day   day  day   as you can see it s a push pull legs push pull routine the legs lag a bit behind in this routine because we only have dbs but we are home bound so we keep it simple you will get high reps and burning legs so it makes up for the light weight a bit   now the best part you only need to change plates once or twice a week depending on your progression there is no warmup needed   every exercise is  sets as many reps as possible   if you can do  reps on your first set of overhead presses you increase the weight once you do overhead presses again not before simple right so you wil do every exercise aside from pushups and air squats obviously with the same set of dumbbells at least once   rest between sets is  minute rest between exercises is  minute you can do this workout in your home office lunch break takes about    minutes or so then have your protein shake   the least amount of weight you can increase the dumbbells the better personally i can increase each db by  kg so order yourself some microplates because dbs are more difficult than barbells and more awesome make sure your dbs can carry a bit of weight otherwise you have the wrong bells   at your  rep max you dont need warmups it s light enough to pull off right away and heavy enough to cause hypertrophy if anybody tells you otherwise punch them in the face and get back to your workout   exercise order is mandatory dont switch around   a few notes    triceps overhead extensions seated one db two hands on one side of the the plates lower behind your head extend over your head    curls this is a bit tricky the best thing i came up with is do them standing and grab one db with both hands at the plates and curls them up you will feel them in your biceps but also increase your grip and forearm strength it s awesome do it    upright rows i know some people complain about them being bad for your wrists and shoulders i agree  if you use a barbell but we use dumbells the bells dont move parallel to the ground but in an angle thumbs higher than pinkies  keep the dbs in front of your thighs naturally and pull them up in a natural path until your thumbs touch your nipples this way you not only work your side delts but also your traps    as many reps as possible per set that means go until you cant finish the rep and get stuck mid way and your eyes pop out exercises are safe unlike for example barbell bench press where this will hurt or kill you unless you have a good spotter   one pair of dumbbells plate change for the lazy plate changer high frequency training moderate frequency per muscle group moderate volume moderate intensity minimal equipment pump progressive overload increased strength home office compatible give it a shot dont be a sissy thank me later

exercise are extremely well documented without pause stories have been published for years about how exercise pays physical and psychological dividends with few if any drawbacks meanwhile evidence continues to mount that a multitude of chronic illnesses are associated with a sedentary lifestyle especially if it is coupled with a diet that is high in processed sugars saturated fats and an abundance of starchy and empty carbohydrates   to avoid these health risks maintain a healthy weight and promote wellness even limited exercise can be extremely beneficial it has been linked with improved mood and data suggests that this is because it can positively impact one s brain chemistry https  www psychologytoday com sg blog balanced    the link between bdnf and neuroplasticity amp and

individuals immune systems while a healthy immune system is always important it has become invaluable during the coronavirus pandemic true exercise cannot prevent one from being infected with the virus but recent research https  www newsweek com study suggests regular exercise can prevent coronavirus patients developing severe complications     out of the university of virginia suggests that exercise may prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards  which appears to affect between  percent and  percent of covid  patients it is one of the deadliest complications associated with the disease the study found that  percent of patients who develop covid related ards will die    exercise and the antioxidant ecsod  exercise does not fight the virus itself or grant individuals some kind of special immunity rather the virginia study found that exercise increases the production of an antioxidant produced in the muscles known as extracellular superoxide dismutase ecsod  in addition to increasing ecsod levels in existing muscle tissue more exercise particularly weight training also produces more muscle tissue more muscle tissue means an increase in the potential amount of ecsod that the body can produce   once secreted into the bloodstream ecsod is then redistributed throughout the body to protect cells by serving as a potent anti inflammatory agent for patients with ards this means ecsod is sent to the lungs to reduce the inflammation there as the danger posed by ards depends upon how widespread the inflammation in the lungs becomes and consequently how much the inflammation deprives the body of oxygen ecsod levels could be the difference between a mild case of ards and a deadly one   dr zhen yan the author of the review believes that ecsod may be used as a potential treatment for a wide variety of conditions in addition to ards though research into the full spectrum of its effects is still in its infancy ecsod s potency as an anti inflammatory agent relative to others that exist in our body and diet is still being studied    obesity as a risk factor  as dr yan asserts ecsod levels could at least partially account for the disparities in symptoms among individuals infected with the novel coronavirus unfortunately ards is not the sole complication that arises from the disease and it is likely that ecsod levels are but one factor impacting how ill patients become as the virus is still new and comprehensive studies have yet to be conducted there are far more questions about the virus and the illness it causes than there are definitive answers   however initial research and anecdotal evidence from hospital workers does suggest that there are numerous risk factors that can make a severe case of covid  more probable it has been widely reported that those who are immunocompromised or over the age of  are at a higher risk for severe illness as are those with any one of the following conditions https  www cdc gov coronavirus   ncov hcp underlying conditions html    chronic kidney disease   chronic lung disease   diabetes   liver disease   moderate to severe asthma   serious heart conditions  yet another factor that appears to exist independent of diabetes is obesity especially if one has a body mass index bmi of  or higher  studies https  www nytimes com      health coronavirus obesity higher risk html are finding that obesity may be second only to age in determining whether or not a person becomes critically ill with the disease   researchers are not certain why obesity seems to independently make patients more susceptible to severe covid  symptoms but it is possible that it could also be tied to inflammation researchers have found that adipose tissue fat secretes cytokines that trigger inflammation the more adipose tissue in the body the more the body remains in a state of low grade and chronic inflammation that has been shown to make individuals more susceptible to certain viral infections most notably severe strains of influenza https  www longdom org open access the impact of obesity on immune response to infection and vaccine an insight into plausible mechanisms          pdf like   s h n   if this is true one can think of an increase in adipose tissue as having the opposite effects on the immune system as an increase in muscle tissue the former hinders patients immune systems during incidents of infection while the latter enhances them consequently any effort to reduce one s bmi provided one is obese could potentially reduce the risk of developing complications associated with covid     the fact that exercise can reduce obesity and leads to the increased production of ecsod are two more reasons why everyone should try to find at least   minutes to exercise each week provided they are physically able to do so

Exercise,Abdoh_Ash,self.Exercise,2020-04-19 03:37:57,suggestions on how to improve shoulder stability  hi gentlemen   i m an  year old guy i started working out  months ago but am having some problems with my shoulder   i work out at home i first did calisthenics but now i also use resistance bands for isolation exercises   when i first started i had little knowledge i naively did a lot of push ups sit ups and squats i did no pull ups at all   so what happened is the following i noticed that both of my arms would click if i internally rotated them and that my left arm would click when laterally raised   plus that i noticed that my shoulders became rounded and that my posture wasn t good   so i stopped all exercises and started working only on   rear deltoid  external rotators of the rotator cuff  upper back  biceps triceps and forearm  serratus anterior because i had and still have scapular winging especially in my right shoulder    after a few months of training all i can say is that my posture improved greatly my shoulders look great and my back is stronger   but the problem is i can t get my shoulder clicking free the clicking isn t painful but it s weird and feels not right   my left shoulder now clicks when i front raise it it clicks multiple times when abducted to the side and then rotated externally and internally my right shoulder is more quieter and doesn t click when front raised even though it is supposed to be more rounded or internally rotated than my left shoulder   now the question is what did i do wrong what did i miss did i move from an imbalance to an imbalance   are my external rotators now overtaking my internal ones   i was advised not to stretch them could they be tight   i m quite desperate since i wanna get back and train my lats chest and front delts again but at the same time i am afraid that doing so would be a suicide for my shoulders

Exercise,powersurfer11,self.Exercise,2020-04-18 15:20:11,volume vs intensity when not targeting gains    a certain virus has made my normal form of exercise surfing illegal so i ve been working out at home i ve also been trying to learn about exercise science which has been equal parts enlightening and confusing i have a question and i d like to say thanks in advance for any answers or information   i have a little circuit that brings me to fatigue after  rounds   if i cut the reps in half and do ten rounds i m not as fatigued and therefore could do more rounds what are the benefits of that and am i losing something by not pushing myself to exhaustion   and what if i spaced the rounds out throughout the day thereby increasing the volume further i know i d lose the cardio endurance benefits but would i stand to lose anything else   note i am not trying to put on muscle i m just genuinely curious about how this all works 
Exercise,OppositionMemorialCe,self.Exercise,2020-04-18 13:00:27,am i the only one who does not care for bike riding as an ideal source of cardio  a friend of mine is an avid bike rider he is obsessed with it he has the expensive mountain bike helmet layers of clothing etc  essentially is always geared up and ready to go  i am on the opposite end of the spectrum i am a bodybuilder who loves lifting heavy weights i never was into cardio now i am incorporating it into my weekly routine just to maintain good heart health  anyway my friend kept irritating me and practically begged me to go riding one night he kept describing it as the best thing since sliced bread   we ended up riding for nearly  hours one evening by the time it was over i felt like it didn t really have that much of an effect on me sure it wasn t easy and he outperformed me due to years of practice  but i still did not feel like it was truly taxing or even gratifying to me what ended up happening was my legs began giving out before my heart got a chance to really be worked i must ve stopped the bike over   times throughout our  hour ride  not because my heart was racing but because of lactic acid buildup in my legs   the next week my neighbors asked me to join them in a brutal game of basketball i remember being so engaged and into the game that time flew by   hours to be exact  we ran up and down the court non stop i was dripping wet and felt like that was the best cardio i had ever gotten it just seems so much more engaging and interesting than riding a bike which appears dull and left me eager to drag my bike back home   i used to play basketball before i got into bodybuilding and was exceptional at it obviously people have their own preferences but i am curious if any one else feels like bike riding is overrated and insufficient to other forms of cardio like swimming or basketball  you are also still sitting on a seat the entire time of the ride you re technically on a machine transferring pressure to two wheels

Exercise,caters1,self.Exercise,2020-04-01 20:41:30,is the heart rate syncing with the tempo of the music true or is it just a myth  so when i researched about music during cardio and its effect this is what i found in several articles   gt if you listen to music at a certain tempo while running your heart will sync up with the tempo so if the tempo of the music is   bpm so is your heart rate   okay so if i listen to the first movement of beethoven s fifth while running my heart rate should be   bpm because that s the tempo of the music right here is what has actually happened     movement first theme second theme development first theme second theme coda   tempo      hr                                         nowhere did my heart rate ever reach the   bpm of the music and in fact it got lower than my standing heart rate now according to those articles that isn t supposed to happen this made me be skeptical of those articles and think well it s just a myth heart rate and tempo are unrelated no matter what   i tested it again today but with slower music and guess what happened my heart rate synced up with the tempo tempo was about   bpm and so was my heart rate now i m more confused is there simply an upper limit to the tempo that your heart can sync up to does the heart rate already have to be elevated above   bpm before the tempo has a significant effect or is the heart rate and tempo syncing up just coincidental and thus the articles stating a myth i definitely think that if the heart truly does sync up with the tempo that it has an upper limit of at least   bpm before the tempo has no effect

Exercise,reggiebennett,self.Exercise,2020-03-17 09:31:45,at home chest workout  reggie bennett the beginning of the week is related to chest training on mondays and tuesdays with the help of machines what can we do when we can t go to the gym and we want to continue training chest we propose a post with a home chest workout plan the chest training that we present can be done anywhere without machines only with the help of our own body weight and basing the training on plyometric push ups   with this type of training it is not intended to gain muscle mass it is training based mainly on gaining power from the upper train since all the exercises we propose are performed explosively these types of exercises are not suitable for beginners you need good postural control and good muscle tone   the routine consists of four exercises it can be done in the form of a circuit resting about  seconds between each exercise or perform  series of each exercise resting between series and series  minutes these times will vary according to the objective we pursue for resistance strength work it is preferable to perform the circuit with about  repetitions of each exercise however if we want to focus on the power the second option is advisable making each series between   repetitions   the first exercise consists of performing plyometric push ups with lateral displacement an excellent exercise to work also with the lower train coordination the second exercise is even more intense and more explosive it consists of performing plyometric push ups with a slap for this type of exercise it is advisable to put a mat on the floor in case there is a fault   for the third exercise we propose the push ups in which we have to turn the body every time we perform a flex and to finish the routine diamond push ups in which we put the thumb and index finger of the hands together making the triceps more participants   here are a series of exercises that you can do at home without any material   lower chest exercises this exercise is one of the best known and consists of the typical push ups that everyone has ever done if they don t work out or it costs too much work they can be done vertically by supporting the arms on the wall or on the kitchen countertop and leaning slightly forward so that the effort is much smoother over time it is advisable to learn more and more leaning on a table then on the sofa if it is leaning against a wall  to end up doing them horizontally   palms pressure the palms of the hands must be placed together with the thumbs attached to the chest the forearms parallel to the floor and the legs open at the height of the hips in that position exert force by pressing one hand against another for a moment   scissors arms standing with your legs open at hip level your arms should be stretched by placing them parallel to the floor in this position make a horizontal scissor movement   source  https  bit ly wwmzl  https  bit ly wwmzl

edge about what chords are coming next   dear friend         do you have any idea how valuable this knowledge is can    you see how it could benefit you right away and give you a    big edge in music let s take an example from another    field         what if you had the ability to predict what the price of a    stock let s say ibm would be tomorrow morning would that give    you ad edge in the stock market even if you were wrong   of    the time it would only be a matter of months until you were    so rich you wouldn t be able to spend all the money you made     right         of if you could predict what the price of pork bellies or    cattle or soybeans or corn or anything  you would soon    own the world and most of the solar system         in music money isn t involved directly but another    kind of riches is  satisfaction enjoyment mutual respect of    other musicians etc  and you have it within your power to    gain the ability to accurately predict  with accuracy ranging    from   up to    what will happen next in a song in    terms of chord progressions         will you ever be wrong of course i still miss now and then     but you ll understand the framework of why chords progress the    way they do so your confidence level will soar   wouldn t it be nice if    you could predict which chord would probably come next    in a song         i ve got some good news for you         it is    possible     not    but    somewhere on the order of   to   accurate         that s because music has  form     like the skeleton that holds your flesh muscles and    skin up if you had no bones  no skeleton  your    flesh and all the other parts of you would fall in a    heap on the floor not a pretty picture but because you    do have a skeleton you are able to walk around and    pretty accurately predict which way your next step will    take you         it s the same in music music has    form     a skeleton to hold it up hold it together and that    skeleton is made out of chords  harmony  the tonal    center of the song or piece   you can    predict which chord comes next you can    become a musical mindreader         in any given key you can play in there are  primary chords  chords that occur way more    than other chords they are like family members of that    particular key         at your house let s say you have  people in your    family  your spouse your child and you on the same    block but down the street a few houses lives your    cousin and her family         at any given moment who are the most likely people to    be in your house   obama        payton manning                            rush                   barry bonds   i don t think so         it s possible of course but not too likely if i had    to guess i would say it would be either you your    spouse or your child it might be your cousin down the    street  there s a much better chance of that than say     hillary or george  but my best odds would be to guess    that the family members would be there         it s the    same way with chords     in any given key     there are  family members that are residents of that    key  the    i    chord the    iv    chord and the    v chord     they are far and away the most likely chords    to occur in any given key     what    chord comes next   so how    could i tell whether it should be    f    or    g       if the    melody is a b     then the chord is probably a    g    chord why because b     is in the    g    chord but is not in the    f    chord       if the    melody is a a     than i would guess that the chord is    f     why because a     is in the    f    chord but is not in the    g    chord       does that    mean that there are always just  chords in a song no     but there are literally hundreds of songs that are made    of just  chords       what if    there are more than  chords in a song what then         that s what we ll take up in the course so you ll    understand it clearly     how will it    help you to become a musical mindreader   you ll amaze other    musicians amp friends who don t know what you know       you will develop more confidence    in your playing as a musician       if you play for a    living there s a good chance it will increase your    income       if you teach piano or    guitar or any instrument you ll have a wealth of    knowledge about music that you can share with your    students   learn what    chords will occur in any key       learn what    chord to start on  once you know the key of a song       learn what    three chords are the most likely to be used in any song       learn what    chords th chords want to progress to       learn the    family of chords and never wonder who is in each family    again       apply your    new knowledge to any song in any key  major or minor       you ll learn    about the fam  the cousins  and the neighbors      enough chords to keep you going and other guessing for a    long time       you ll also learn all    about the circle of ths and how it reveals family    secrets of key relationships chord relationships chord    progressions chord substitutions     do    you see the power in this once you understand the circle    of ths and how it works there s no key that can stump you     you ll understand every single key that any song or    piece could be written in people who know and understand this    circle are at a tremendous advantage over other musicians         i could go on and on but if you don t see the power of    becoming a musical mindreader by now there s nothing

Exercise,GregFeith,self.Exercise,2020-02-21 03:34:49,exercise myths and mistakes  a list for beginners i read a lot of myths floating around in posts from folks who are just getting into exercise or are inexperienced so i thought i d put together a list of beginner s myths and mistakes these have been compiled from my own mistakes research and application in the gym and kitchen  hope this helps some of you folks who are just getting started   for those more experienced please keep in mind that i have simplified a lot of this information so that beginners may find it easy to absorb                    myths  mistakes                     i don t care about building muscle i just want to burn  lose the fat   the fact is  building muscle or more precisely stimulating muscle growth and burning fat go hand in hand when you exercise you are not only going to burn fat but you will also send a message to your body that you want more muscle because you are making it perform physical tasks that it is not used to doing so how does it respond  by adding more muscle so that you may perform your new exercises more efficiently and safely you cannot burn fat without adding any muscle how much muscle you gain is dependent on many factors but you will gain some in any case   note  the more muscle you have on your body the easier you will find it to keep fat off your body long term because muscle eats fat                      i want to convert fat into muscle   fat and muscle are actually  completely different types of body tissue and cannot be converted to each other the correct way to think about it is i want to burn fat and gain muscle                      i want to burn fat only from around my waist   nope that s not how fat burn works  you cannot isolate fat burn your body will burn fat from all your fat reserves and they are all over your body including on your face  you cannot choose where to burn it from   that said your genetics may influence where you may lose it the most your butt may let fat go only in tiny trickles while it just flows out of other parts   note  this poses a challenge to some women who would like to reduce belly fat but want to preserve their curves yes you will lose fat from   everywhere  some trial and error will be required to keep the proportions you want   i have had many female athlete friends who told me they opted for breast implants because they were so athletic that their breasts just   disappeared  but this is only a concern if you re a real serious athlete                      i m going to run to my gym and then do my heavy lifting   if you are going to do any kind of challenging weightlifting you want to conserve all your energy for it so running or performing any other intense activity before lifting is not advisable if it s a short jog just to get your blood flowing that s fine but you certainly don t want any kind of running or sprinting  and try to limit the jog to about   minutes   why  because lifting relies heavily on carbohydrates for instant energy so if you deplete your reserves before you get to the gym you are reducing the amount available for lifting                      i m going to do  minutes of cardio treadmill  elliptical before lifting weights   for the same reason as   this is a mistake lift first save the cardio for last   note  when you lift first esp heavy lifting  then do your cardio it has the nice effect of burning more fat because lifting depletes glycogen carbohydrates and your body then turns more to fat reserves for energy when you do cardio this the reason why some people do cardio on an empty stomach  there is no sugar in the blood stream so the body will rely more heavily on fat for energy thus burning through your fat reserves more                      the longer i stay in the gym the more effective my workout   not at all  the results you see will be dependent on training intensity not on duration if your workout looks like the following realize that you re not getting the most out of your workout    minute slow easy exercise   minutes changing tracks on your phone   minutes speaking to your buddy   more minute slow easy exercise   minutes answering an urgent work email on your phone         minutes in the gym   your heart rate is so low you can sing opera   ok i ve spent a good amount of time here i ve done my part let s go home   however if your workout looks more like this chances are you are maximizing your workout effectiveness    minute intense exercise     seconds rest   more minute intense exercise     seconds rest   more minute intense exercise      done in    minutes   you feel the blood surging everywhere you feel your heart pounding  of course intensity should start low and increase only as long as it is safe given your injuries and medical conditions but results are directly proportional to intensity not to duration   the exception to this  rule of course is if you re an endurance athlete training for a marathon if endurance is your goal then yes a longer workout may help build endurance                       sets of an exercise is better than  sets  not always in fact i d say that  really good sets of almost any exercise should be enough to fatigue your muscles and stimulate muscle adaptation growth they say that some bigger muscles like thighs require more sets because of their size   that is debatable i still favor   intense sets   what is a good set  a set where you re focused you ve picked a weight such that you are able to maintain good form good range of motion and you re not stopping before you re even challenged see     one cannot argue with the fact that doing  good focused intense sets is much better than doing  crappy half hearted sets                      more reps is better  similar to   doing fewer reps but good focused ones is much better than doing many half hearted reps so stop staring off into space addressed in    connect your mind with the muscle you are working and do really good reps   note   and  imply   if you do good reps and good sets you need to spend much less time in the gym to see the same results so all the more incentive to focus                      stopping as soon as you feel the slightest bit of burn in the muscle  this is a massive noob mistake  you need to realize that the last few repetitions of an exercise are the most important ones   they are the reps that will stimulate muscle adaptation growth so if you start to feel a slight burn on rep  and you immediately stop you have just wasted your time  but if you push forward through that discomfort barrier and do   more reps till you re no longer able to do a single rep with good form then you re signaling your body that it needs to get stronger   that will stimulate gains   if you re always playing it safe your body will also be happy doing nothing in response   the way you tell your body you want to get stronger is to get past the discomfort barrier if you re not doing new physical tasks the body has never performed before why would you need more muscle   note  of course there is a distinction between normal soreness and injury from improper form or excess weight pay attention to the discomfort most people can intuitively tell the difference between the normal burning sensation at the end of a set of lifting weights vs an abnormal pain caused by hurting yourself pay attention but try to get past your comfort zone                      holding your breath during a set  you absolutely need to breathe throughout your exercise never hold your breath   beginners will find it challenging to develop a proper breathing rhythm follow this general rule and it will become second nature over time   inhalation  inhale when performing the less challenging half of a single repetition i e the lowering of the weight example let s say you re doing biceps curls the part when you re lowering the dumbbell is when you would inhale   exhalation  exhale as you perform the more challenging half of a single repetition i e the lifting part of the rep example let s say you re doing biceps curls the part when you re lifting the dumbbell is when you would exhale                      heavier is better  guys will be more familiar with this syndrome you see the big guy next to you curling  lbs so you grab the  s   you start swinging the weights only halfway up and down till your set looks more like a zumba dance than a biceps curl   if you do this you will get results   not the kind that you wanted but the kind that your physiotherapist had hoped for because you will end up injuring yourself not only that you have probably done zero to stimulate any muscle growth   the number one priority should always be proper form and range of motion if you cannot do a rep smoothly in full muscular control of the weight   without swinging or jerking your body you re lifting too heavy put your ego aside and grab the lighter weights when you can do all reps in good form and it s easy yes go heavier                      using momentum instead of muscular work  similar to   this usually happens when the selected weight is too heavy typically people do this with biceps curls or lat pulldowns if you use your body s momentum to move the weight you re not utilizing the muscles that you want to target and hence the exercise will not produce the right stimulus for the muscle to get stronger   for instance with lat pulldowns if you jerk your torso backwards to bring the weight down you may look cool or not  but your lats are doing almost no work so you won t get results again your physiotherapist may enjoy seeing you exercise with momentum because he knows you ll be visiting him soon                      going through the motions  staring off into space during a set  if you just go through the motions without concentrating your effort so that the right load is placed on your muscles you are better off on the couch at home watching tv because at least you re paying attention when watching tv  no attention  no stimulus and no adaptation  growth   pay attention when you exercise know which muscle you are exercising don t do an exercise just because you saw some other guy doing it and it looked cool if you know which muscle you are targeting that will help you focus your effort during the actual set feel the muscle as it is being worked feel every contraction   this is sometimes called mind muscle connection   if you don t even feel your targeted muscle during the set you re wasting your time   example  you come to the lat pulldown machine take a moment to understand what you will be doing  ok this works my lats on the sides of my back then focus your attention on the lats muscles during the set                      busting your butt in the gym and then driving to mcdonald s for lunch  this is a huge mistake  if you work hard in the gym and then eat bad foods you re undoing a lot of the work you did in the gym   if you re exercising hard and wondering why you re not seeing positive results examine your diet                       whole grain bread  there are very few whole grain breads that actually live up to their name the only genuine whole grain bread i know of is sprouted bread by a brand named ezekiel there may be others but i have not come across them   how can you tell if a bread or other product is truly whole grain   look at the ingredients if you see the word flour anywhere dump it like shit down a toilet whole grain flour is just as bad for you as any other flour there is nothing whole grain about it if it has flour   this  is one of the biggest scams in the food industry                      fat is bad  not quite certain types of fats trans fats found in fast foods are bad consuming fats in large amounts  gt   gm per day is not advisable unsaturated fats in small amounts are not only good but required for proper body functioning   as an example the yolks in eggs help stimulate testosterone production that s a good thing  so is egg fat bad  only if you eat too much most people can safely eat   yolks a day                      not eating enough protein  first understand this  we don t build muscle in the gym in fact we damage muscle in the gym when we go home and rest is when we build repair the muscle using protein most of this happens when we sleep so there s a great reason to get your  hours of sleep each night   protein is to muscle what bricks are to a house without eating enough protein at least  gm  day for active females   gm  day for active males  you re wasting your effort in the gym and may even end up losing muscle called atrophy    try to get enough protein and from various sources as per your preferences  food allergies etc dairy poultry meats fish soya powdered supplements lentils  pulses beans nuts  nut butters and even some vegetables e g spinach broccoli peas

Exercise,jennijohns,self.Exercise,2020-01-31 00:52:43,the  really obvious ways to workout better than you ever did for the majority of the people in this world getting motivated to exercise or even beginning to exercise is difficult but there are a few of us who actually do the opposite of this we exercise too much   here are the top  obvious ways to workout effectively    go for high intensity workouts   if you are new to exercise go slow build your stamina gradually when you are running or cycling try to build up your endurance do it for at least one month only then get into intense exercise first focus on building your endurance you can then work on sharpening the intensity to make it more effective for you    include protein in your diet   proteins are a must if you have certain fitness goals if you want to build your muscles properly say yes to proteins you will not avail a lot from a workout if you do not include enough protein in your daily diet when you do cardio and strength workouts you need protein as well for proper muscle building the best sources of protein that you can go for are whey protein and soy protein shakes    go for the right cardio exercise   go for an exercise form that suits you and that engages you the most you can choose your ideal one from running walking swimming hiking etc once your body gets accustomed to this type of exercise the fun begins    drink water   you ought to drink a good deal of water if you want to focus on your muscles in short you need to keep yourself hydrated throughout the day this is truly vital your body might take some time to absorb the water thus you need to drink the right amount of water before exercise get into this healthy habit if you wish to build your muscles    shake well    you can get into the habit of taking protein shakes before and after the workout you can even go for a protein carb shake when you take this healthy shake before your workout it betters the flow of amino acids to your muscles in your body this is necessary when you train hard this way your muscles get a good deal of energy to build up once you are done with the workout this shake leads to the stimulation of muscle growth   you can consider taking a small protein carb meal one hour after a workout keep in mind that a meal replacement bar works well for many so go for it    go for compound exercises   go for exercises that work on more than one muscle group it will benefit you more try not to go for exercises like a bicep curl rather consider going for a full body workout keep in mind that all of your muscles work together some of the good compound exercises are inclusive of squats deadlifts pushups bench presses military presses rows pullups etc    include carbs as well   carbs might be of some importance as well low carb is no good however carbs form your body s major source of fuel if you are into intense workouts you will have to include carbs in your diet without carbs you might not get the energy and drive to do intense workouts you can add some carbs into your shake you can also go for a banana it is a good low fiber food that contains high glycemic carbohydrates you need such carbohydrates to exercise    try to balance lifting   balance is key once again try to do lifting in standing posture this will benefit you more this way you will be forced to balance yourself at the time of lifting this will put all of your core muscles into action it increases your overall body strength and helps you lift better the next time   say yes to slow lifting try to lift and lower to a  second count in both directions go for heavier weight you can start with lower weights this will help you focus on your form you can then lift the heaviest weights   however you must never sacrifice your form for heavyweights both are important when you strike the right balance it gives you the best possible fitness results even if you do not wish to get muscular lifting heavy weights can help you in maintaining overall fitness   you must focus on increasing your effectiveness you can do so by lifting heavyweights   in order to increase your effectiveness you can play with toys as well this will increase the fun element in order to increase the intensity you can add a prop some of the useful props are dumbbells kettlebells sliding discs etc these are easily available at gyms you can also purchase these from online websites with these props you can increase the effectiveness of moves like pushups and crunches   good props boost your aerobic capacity these also enhance your core strength as well as dynamic balance these also help you reduce a good number of calories in short time periods   consider getting competitive a little competition can make it fun for you when you competitive you tend to stay motivated to go forward with your fitness routines you do not need people to pity you or console you here you need people to help you push a bit harder than the previous day this is a great way to work out harder so get a workout partner or group   focus on increasing the intensity of your workout even if you lessen the workout time it will pay off if you increase the intensity   you can go for interval training through this you can sharpen the intensity of your workout sessions it helps you reduce your abdominal fat as well as body weight the good thing is that the muscle mass is maintained   put on some good music music works well for a workout identify as to what type of playlist really works for you try to collect songs that make you feel liberated and motivated when you have good music playing in the background you get to work harder effortlessly it also helps you to maintain consistency a soft piece of music can have a great impact on you while hard rock can suit your friend more you need to single out your kind of songs   source  www weightdirectory com https  www weightdirectory com

Exercise,ElvisLifts,self.Exercise,2020-01-28 04:24:35,ex power lifter goes calisthenics route   kg lost  hey guys my name is elvis i am new here and i wanted to  to share  my progress  https  ibb co znswntq https  ibb co znswntq  in losing weight with everyone i posted my progress on reddit in other group and received excellent feedback which motivates me even more to work hard and never give up on my goal and dream i figured that my journey belongs in this community too because sometimes i go to the gym sometimes i do gym work calisthenics cardio so fitness in general and i am a bodybuilding fan   lets hope this post motivates someone because nothing feels better than motivate someone else with your hard work   some background about me i used to go to the gym and i trained a power lifter style   rep range i always was big but never lean i got quite strong and still am but i always wanted to be lean and ripped   having a  pack was my goal even at very young age but i always find some excuse to eat wrong foods but somehow last summer around mid july i listened to a audio book some people might know it some not the book is written by david goggins it s called can t hurt me and i have to say it changed my life completely   it ignited the fire and motivation that i needed for the breakthrough and after that i set myself my own goals now eating clean diet with maybe  cheat food is my new lifestyle i pretty much live the lifestyle which seemed unreasonable before   i workout pretty much everyday i don t recommend this to beginners and my diet is high in protein with healthy fats omega s and complex carbs like oatmeal for example   i don t drink soda nor i eat fast food i am not a smoker and i seldom drink at first you might think this lifestyle is boring but when you realize that health should be your number one priority in life your thinking changes   little story my blood pressure was very high for my weight and height maybe because of power lifting im not sure  or maybe because i have high genetic bp so i have to live healthy to sustain my good health so when i get older i still have amazing health and strong heart etc so this is very important to me every kg lbs of weight just raises my blood pressure   people get used to everything and that was key for me i just had to get trough the first two weeks of diet and a lot of exercise before i get used to it now it s my lifestyle and so far i have lost  kg  lbs i look better i feel better my sleep has improved my mood is not that aggressive and depressed i think more positive about life in general i don t regret not eating sweet stuff like candy at all after a while you just don t even crave it that much and in my opinion this is the only way to get the results we want we have to change the lifestyle mindset to actually progress   i have my entire journey filmed and i made a transformation motivation video so if someone is interested in my journey you can check me out on youtube just type elvislifts and you will find me any support is highly appreciated   if you have any questions feel free to ask   some stats about me   my height is   m  my starting weight was  kg  lbs  my current weight is  kg  lbs  my blood pressure was    now it is      power lifting stats before transition these are personal best    bench press   kg    squat  kg    deadlift  kg  at the moment my lifts in gym would not be that high but i am fine with that

Exercise,Drayger83,self.Exercise,2019-12-12 16:43:34,my thoughts on some of the biggest benefits to be aware of when starting a fitness journey to help you keep track of progress i m pretty keen on exercise and while not the most athletic i have seen some incredible benefits from regularly exercising   minutes a day to maintain my health both physical and mental i really wanted to share this because i hope it inspires people who are thinking of beginning and how it can truly transform significant aspects of their lives   here s a video detailing some of the benefits if you prefer to watch but i ve also written my findings below for those who prefer reading i ve bulleted it to make it easier to read  https  www youtube com watch v dmzwax da  https  www youtube com watch v dmzwax da    weight loss     the most obvious and common reason people normally exercise it helps to lose weight and burn fat in the body    your body spends energy in  ways digesting food exercising and maintaining body functions done by vital organs like the heart    while dieting can aid weight loss it slows your metabolic rate unlike exercise which increases it and will in turn burn more calories and help you lose weight more effectively   makes you happier     exercise has been found to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression anxiety and stress    this is because it produces changes in the brain by releasing hormones to help regulate stress and anxiety and relieve feelings of depression    it also releases endorphins which make you feel good and make you feel happier as a result    the amazing thing is you don t need to do an intense workout for the effects but just being active can help make you happier   increases energy levels     it might seem contradictory but exercise actually increases your energy levels through the day    studies have shown that six weeks of regular exercise reduced the feelings of fatigue of  people who had reported persistent fatigue    doing regular exercise has been shown to be more effective in combating chronic fatigue syndrome cfs  than passive therapies such as relaxation or stretching    in addition exercise has been shown to increase energy levels in people suffering from progressive illnesses such as cancer hiv aids and multiple sclerosis   help skin health     your skin can be affected by the amount of oxidative stress in your body which occurs when the body s antioxidant defenses cannot completely repair the damage that free radicals cause to cells    while intense and exhaustive exercise can contribute to oxidative damage regular moderate exercise can increase your body s production of natural antioxidants    this means exercise can stimulate blood flow and induce skin cell adaptations that can help delay the appearance of skin aging    meaning to get healthy and glowing skin naturally regularly do a light daily workout   improve brain function and memory     regular exercise can improve brain function and help memory and thinking skills as it increases your heart rate it promotes the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain helping it function more effectively    in addition to this it can also stimulate the production of hormones that can enhance the growth of brain cells and exercise has been shown to grow the hippocampus which is a part of the brain that s vital for memory and learning  if there s any others you can think of please share as i think it adds as motivation to keep pushing through

Exercise,LeoniteCross,self.Exercise,2019-12-05 04:09:59,need help convincing my fiance to exercise more after typing this i realized this became more of a rant and venting of my frustrations i love this woman to pieces but the lack of drive influenced by he depression most likely is hard to deal with without me becoming the bad guy who is uncaring or demanding or pushing her too hard i want her to enjoy exercise and she absolutely does enjoy it when we workout together but getting her off the couch is the hard part she almost always feels great after working out   let me clarify she sees a personal trainer two times a week and he definitely works her out but she never does her homework routines shes about   and suffer s from anxiety and depression she s never missed a session with her trainer even on the nights she s not feeling    probably has a lot to do with that her trainer is my best friend from high school and we see him every saturday for dnd game movie night and he s a bit of an ass lol     with the rare exception of her working out with my friend i cannot influence her to workout otherwise if she s feeling good and is motivated that day then we will go for a walk or hit up the gym together or do her homework routine together but if she s not feeling   it s like threading a needle while being far sighted   the plus side to this is that she is a dog walker a business we started two years ago and now have a stream of daily clients monday and tuesday being her busiest where she conducts up to three  min walks with thursday and friday there usually are only one   all in all i would normally say that walking for an hour the daily average plus two days of intense exercise would be enough but it just seems like it isn t mostly from a cico perspective   before she started to train with my friend she got down to an all time low of   down from   her previous and current high while doing a strict keto diet  lt  g carbs per day her trainer said that the year or so it took to get her from   to   eating sometimes less than   calories a day likely damaged her metabolism and so she had to start eating   calories believe it or not eating enough is sometimes as hard as eating too little and to drop keto which made her weight shoot back up in the  months they ve been training  admittedly she s gained a ton of muscle in that time as well she s definitely not as flabby as she once was especially in her thigh s  recently he s been dialing her back week by week until we hit last week s new count of     i know i may be sounding unreasonable when i want demand she workout more than she already does but if she s not walking dogs she s on the couch watching youtube or playing video games i know working out is lt   of the equation but this isn t the forum for dieting lol  the biggest problem there is portion control and staying consistent not necessarily craving sweets but can t stop unless the plate is empty only sometimes weighing measuring food   then there is scheduling issues we can t really set a dedicated time that we will not compromise on for gym hours first our gym is only open til pm otherwise that would probably increase our workouts by at least   per month  we often have meet and greet s for clients in the late afternoon evening when people get off work plus we have a semi regular client that is a graveyard shift nurse that we walk feed potty around    but if convincing her to go to the gym on the rare free evening is nothing compared to the actual outright hostility i get if i try to wake her up any earlier than i already do  i get up at am for classes even on the days my classes are at  just for the consistency  trying to get her up at  when she doesn t have to get up until  most days anyway is a nightmare  she has at least gotten into the routine of getting up with me at  though she absolutely goes right back to sleep more often than not even if it s just on the couch as soon as i m out the door around    and if you re wondering why i get up an hour and a half before going to school while i wake up like a bolt of lightning i still like to take my mornings slow   i have been with this woman for seven years at this point and i am still deeply in love with her this has little to do with physical attraction she was as big or bigger when i first started dating her but as someone who loves fitness and her constant worries about her appearance worries about death she get s so anxious about it she refuses to talk about death i just can t find the right combination of pushing her and not being an unempathetic asshat   anyways  i m ranting and being nitpicky at this point   tl dr fiance has drive and motivation issues complains about gaining weight but doesn t want to workout more than she already does

Exercise,SamStephens,self.Exercise,2019-11-08 09:43:48,interested in working with a personal trainer this consultation guide might help you pick a great one  the following excerpt is taken from my full guide  finding the best personal trainer https  fitstra com finding the best personal trainer  the other sections of the guide cover how to evaluate your needs schedule consultations and other important info leading up to the first meeting this section dives into what to look for in a trainer when you finally sit down and chat about your goals lifestyle and expectations   hope it helps   amp x  b    interviewing the trainer consultation    an effective consultation simultaneously accomplishes two things  it allows a client to assess a trainer s competency and personality compatibility and it also provides the fitness pro with an opportunity to properly evaluate a client s goals baseline movement abilities training preferences and injury limitations this meeting is valuable to clients interested in researching a service but it s critical to a trainer s ability to effectively design an individualized program and should be taken seriously   while you are ultimately basing a purchase on your perception of another s level of proficiency it s incredibly important that from the onset of the meeting you are genuinely seeking a real conversation and not fixated on interrogating an unsuspecting victim  that s not fun for anyone  when judging another person for any job related reason it can be easy to slowly become standoffish and less open as you analyze their responses avoid that be human attentive and honest treat the consult as if your success depends on how effectively you communicate and listen to ideas your final decision will be much easier if you put real effort into connecting with and learning about the person on the other side of the table   with that said there are garbage trainers out there and you need to know how to spot them let s talk about a few major red flags to watch for during the consultation process and some points of general advice for the meeting   a good personal trainer follows a basic consultation template that typically includes a goals lifestyle limitations questionnaire measurements of height weight body composition and a very basic assessment of physical capabilities great trainers will take this monotonous process of discovery and turn it into an enjoyable experience where organic flowing conversation masks the formulaic structure of the interview there are endless ways to evaluate the needs and baseline abilities of a client but some form of investigation is absolutely necessary along with the obvious safety issues created by skipping this step failing to establish a starting point makes it impossible to gauge progress if your trainer wants to begin the first meeting with an intense workout while having no knowledge of your limitations have concerns   because your needs and preferences are the main focus points of this initial interaction you should find yourself talking the majority of the time as you respond to direct and open ended questions the trainer should be genuinely interested in your unique position as they inquire more about you however if you notice a greater emphasis is placed on the advertisement of products and services than on you have concerns in larger corporate and chain gyms it s common for consultations to be used primarily as sales delivery platforms we all need to make a living in this industry but you want to work with an exercise professional whose high quality services are purchasable  not a pushy salesperson with a fitness certification great trainers passively influence a client s decision to buy a product by showcasing value and demonstrating real knowledge persuasion isn t required   as the consult moves along make sure that assessment curiosity goes both ways by asking plenty of your own questions if increasing muscular size is your main focus ask the trainer to outline a basic plan of attack and then dive into the why and how behind their suggested programming a smart and educated fitness pro will be able to answer all of your questions with straightforward explanations and use language that s easy to follow if your eyes glaze over due to complicated anatomical terms and metabolic processes you ve never heard of be concerned reciting textbook definitions of concepts often implies a lack of true comprehension or that someone s trying to impress you with all the big words they just learned either way not ideal meeting with an excellent trainer won t give you with a phd level grasp on exercise physiology in an hour but you should be left with a simple understanding of the proposed program   the topic of nutrition will inevitably arise as you cover the lifestyle portion of the consultation and is an incredibly important part of the session good trainers will make general dietary recommendations based on available research and the advice of trusted health organizations without attempting to give detailed meal plans or precise macronutrient quantities great trainers have extensive nutrition knowledge and make the same general intake recommendations but will ultimately urge their clients to utilize the professional services of registered dietitians for all things food related if your trainer refers to themselves as a nutritionist  be slightly concerned while comprehensive nutrition certifications do exist and there are plenty of knowledgeable trainers that have these credentials anyone in the us can use the label nutritionist to describe their dietary services with absolutely no minimum level of education or certification needed registered dietitians on the other hand must have at least a bachelor s degree are required to complete a dietetic internship program and must pass a state regulated exam to obtain their license great personal trainers can teach you a lot about nutrition but will always acknowledge their credential limitations and recommend you seek out a dietitian for the best educational services on food supplements and nutrient deficiencies   along with being incredibly knowledgeable your trainer should also be fit this lifestyle and appearance requirement is necessary but probably not for the reasons you re imagining an overweight weak and deconditioned trainer with minimal personal exercise experience could design a really effective weight loss exercise program simply by studying available research and other popular programs exercise professionals don t have to have perfect abs to help someone else sculpt theirs however a trainer that exercises intensely sticks to a smart diet and is consistent with their habits will have a level of empathy and insight far greater than that of someone who just understands concepts and theories too many trainers don t practice what they preach and eventually lose an appreciation for the mental and physical effort clients are required to exert in order to be successful some days are fun and swell our bodies and egos with confidence while others absolutely suck a great trainer knows the difference between hard work and punishment because they define each end of the spectrum daily in their own programming with that said don t immediately assume that the person with the superhero physique is as smart as they are fit  genetics and worth ethic are far too often more significant contributing factors to someone s appearance than exercise knowledge and smart program design look for a combination of smarts and strength   a thorough consultation will also include some form of a movement component simple exercises like bodyweight squats require a low level of effort but allow the trainer to gauge basic physical capabilities a great trainer will typically explain the exercise you are about to perform show you how it s done then ask you to copy this tell show do method of instruction should be easy to follow and accompanied by hands on form correction and verbal cues for movement if you re thrown into an exercise with minimal explanation and feel completely lost that s not a great sign  maybe you were just daydreaming if you ask for clarification and are given the same unhelpful directions have concerns not all exercises are easy to learn and perform well but a great trainer will always be able to effectively communicate what they want you to do if your teacher can t teach you ve got a problem   unfortunately evaluating program design and the overall effectiveness of a personal trainer s plan will be difficult for anyone that isn t already pretty knowledgeable in fitness goals focused on strength hypertrophy and weight loss have well established general methods but details will vary from trainer to trainer and that s totally fine if you re working within the parameters of smart research based program design there are plenty of ways to become fit we would need to cover too many things here for you accurately assess if a proposed exercise plan was structured in a way that targeted your goals effectively instead trust that if your trainer is well educated and has a record of client success they re most likely qualified to also help you but if you want a second opinion on a program shoot me an email i ll give you an unbiased opinion and help you make a smart decision   finally don t be pressured into a same day purchase and if possible avoid contracts with a minimum required time commitment unless you re meeting with the last trainer on your list who s obviously the best choice wait until you ve had some time to consider your options before pulling the trigger do your best to distinguish between a persuasive sales pitch and a conversation with a great trainer who s inspiring you to better yourself they ll both have you reaching for your wallet but there s clearly a preferred option regarding contracts only pay month to month if possible it may cost a little more but your power to cancel every  days puts extra pressure on the instructor to keep the quality high and consistent   there are so many different characteristics and personality traits in good and bad personal trainers that it s impossible to cover them all hopefully the few covered here will make it easier for you to separate the good from the bad keep in mind that training styles vary and the presence of one red flag isn t necessarily a deal breaker but be wary if they start to add up ultimately the best trainer for you will be the one you believe to be most competent and get along with best this final decision is subjective and has no real right answer use your best judgement but try not to overthink it trust your gut and continue taking its advice even if it disappears after a few months of hard work   contact your final pick to set up payment and a start date and as before with the first round let the others know you ve decided to go with another option and thank them for their time

Exercise,Baba_Yaga420,self.Exercise,2019-10-20 08:14:04,benefits risk of pushups with different shoulder positions  i am a climber and a beginning personal trainer and throughout my workouts i noticed an issue with holding my shoulder positions while climbing lifting i have been working on scapilar push pull ups but ibwas looking for a new progression   being into calisthenics i have noticed that for several movements l sit planche levers etc  tend to have different optimal shoulder positions that i still have trouble holding despite these scapular exercises being added to my routine   i know that during a pushup for optimal effectiveness and safety your shoulders should be depressed and reteacted but i noticed ehile working towards a planche that i struggle with extending my arms fully in the planche s elevated protracted shoulder position   so i started doing incline pushups with that shoulder position really focusing on slow steady form reps and let me tell you i felt this exercise more than ive felt any other new exercise ive added in a long time no pain but really really strong activation signals or so it seems at least   since myself and my clients are climbers we often find ourselves in unorthodox unstable and sub optimal body positions im wondering if doing pushups with different shoulder positions performed by advanced clients with this specific goal of building shoulder stability in all areas of the shoulder is a justified risk   i m aware that shoulders should be ret and dep fore safety purposes but is it worth it to pursue these exercises further can it even possibly reduce risk of injury for people like climbers during their sport     tldr climber looking to improve shoulder  stability while generally unsafe for beginners can an advanced client see benefits from performing pushups in all variants of shoulder positioning and can it be safe if done properly   also this might be in the wrong place but in all fairness this topic is a question about variations and form of an exercise

Exercise,nouseforaname888,self.Exercise,2019-10-10 18:25:46,swimming is so much more effective than running  i don t deny that running has a lot of benefits   you can burn hundreds of calories running five miles and burn off the fat while building your leg muscles   however running takes a big toll on your body especially on your knees and joints   that s why i recommend swimming over running   why     more muscles worked swimming works out more muscles than does running running primarily targets your leg muscles and a few arm muscles however swimming targets muscles throughout the body ranging from your shoulders to your chest to your obliques all the way to your quads   swimming a lot can make you look more buff especially on your upper body than running will     you can swim a lot more without the fear of injuring your body    laps of  meters burns about   calories give or take some depending on your weight and metabolism to achieve the same calories burned in running you would have to run about  miles yet you can swim this much and the worst injuries you might get are pulled muscles or a tear in shoulder muscle with running on the other hand you put yourself at risk for torn muscles injuries to your joints injured knees sprained ankles plantar fasciitis and the list just goes on and on     swimming makes you more flexible than running can  swimming aids the range of motion especially for the torso shoulder and hips running can t do the same    this can aid you even if you are participating in other sports such as football or basketball seahawks qb russell wilson swims a lot in the offseason to help aid his durability he also hasn t had any major injuries in a sport notorious for them

Exercise,iNhab,self.Exercise,2019-10-09 18:09:55,one specific exercise and why these are the results  hello wanted to share a new exercise that ive heard about and implemented today   it s basically for the upper back and neck to have a better alignment of the body   you stand with your heels ass upper back and back of the hesd touching the wall hands next to the thighs from this position raise arms while holding them straight up until they touch the wall while doing so don t let your back arch   harder modification is to sit with your legs straight while doing so same action   last hardest modification is to bend your knees so that not just lower back is disconnected by sitting but also legs do the same action suggested amount was  times per one modification   however my experience was interesting i was able to hit upper back shoulders and arms were working also but interestingly my right mid lower back was also exercising while doing so meanwhile the left side didn t feel the load at all   and my observation is that my right side of the back is more tense and is bigger as if the muscle is bigger   but that raises a question to me does that mean that back left side is weaker or the right side is weaker and how do i test that

Exercise,WaterCasserole007,self.Exercise,2019-10-03 00:12:54,rant overtraining i m tired of seeing people ask for exercise advice along the lines of i m doing x y z daily or five days a week is this a good program  and somebody replies doing such and such every training will lead to overtraining    this is not true at all yes there are better ways to structure a training regiment to foster better results over time and usually you switch up your day to day a bit and yes you raise the risk for injury if intensity frequency and volume aren t properly considered that said overtraining is a state where someone trains so much that their body simply can t repair itself fast enough i ve seen people site you can overtrain if you do the   pushups a day challenge simply put that s bs if that were the case every carpenter painter construction worker etc would be over trained at some point in their life your body adapts to what it needs to do so if you do   pushups everyday then in a few weeks   pushups really won t cause any damage to the muscle at all people throw the idea around when it s very very rare it s a lack of motivation and muscle soreness that is usually the issue

Exercise,gabrielacasz,self.Exercise,2019-09-06 23:21:43,any advice on how to strengthen my core i can t do knee push ups hey everyone so am a  y f and i recently started exercising  i was never a super active kid i didn t do sports but enjoyed running so it s not like i didn t do anything and when i went into my teens well i just got worse i guess mainly because i was super skinny and idk i just thought i didn t need it  but now i am older and my body is definitely not the same i weight   lbs and my height is around   and the reason why i started going to the gym is because my arms are getting a lot fatter and i have a bit of a belly i know to most people i don t look fat but i am so out of shape that it brings me to my real problem here    i can t do a push up even if my life depended on it and i would really appreciate if anyone has any advice on how to build that core strength what could i do for my chest because even when i do it in my knees it s too difficult and some people at the gym have pointed that the way i tend to compensate could end up hurting my back when i try to go back up which is a big no as i suffered from scoliosis when i was a kid  ps i did physical therapy for the scoliosis and the doctors said i was fine   so any advice in what i can do

Exercise,myrtleeeb,self.Exercise,2019-08-27 20:14:15,overtraining symptoms are you a victim  these days you can t spend more than five minutes in a locker room or read three pages in a magazine without coming across the term overtraining  in a way overtraining seems to be like sub prime mortgages nobody really knows what it is but it sure is responsible for some bad things   so today we shall analyze    what constitutes overtraining   if you are affected and how to fix it   how to use overtraining or better said overreaching to your advantage    what is overtraining    basically  overtraining https  hvmn com blog training overtraining syndrome can sabotage performance occurs whenever the volume and intensity of someone s workouts are exceeding their ability to recover this means progress is coming to a screeching halt due to delayed recovery and elevated cortisol levels   you are likely to lose mass and strength in the process other symptoms include irritability lack of appetite sleeplessness loss of enthusiasm and motivation even depression is in the cards for you you are more likely to get sick and or injured and your little injuries will take longer to heal   muscles recover within  hours which is when protein synthesis rates level off so if you experience any of the above symptoms i would recommend a    hour hiatus from the gym with a solid calorie surplus and a daily nap within  days you should be able to return to the gym and continue on your path to eternal glory and total awesomeness    cases of severe overtraining   unfortunately not all cases of overtraining are cured so easily if the central nervous system cns is overstimulated the recovery process will take a much longer time in those cases the athlete often experiences light to medium depression loss of libido elevated pulse rate and deep seated fatigue   very often this condition goes hand in hand with adrenal burnout those pre workout https  www muscleandstrength com store category pre workout html stims have their downsides for sure  here the first order of business is caffeine yohimbine ephedra etc out passionflower melatonin l tyrosine and zma in also you will need to take a whole week or  days from the gym   this also includes a mental break try not to spend too much time at the muscle and strength website  just this once though you can engage in other activities just no weight training or spending time inside a gym additional recovery measures such as acupuncture cryotherapy or massage can be extremely helpful during that time   you should start taking your resting pulse rate in the morning in order to have a baseline once it has dropped by five or more beats per minute you can make an attempt to return to the gym  but you should cut your workload in half at least for the first two weeks  from there on you can work your way back

Exercise,StrangerFeelings,self.Exercise,2019-08-03 04:17:53,desperately seeking help in exercising i don t know where to start or even what to do  pretty much what the title is is the tl dr  and this post will probably be all over the place so please bear with me   i need help  i need a lot of help  i am nearing   lbs and i am struggling to even start a routine to get fit  i know i know diet helps the most   i get it i really do  but i have trouble stopping my self from eating  i have moderation control issues when it comes to food and snacks   i just visited my doctor earlier to day for my yearly physical and i talked with him about starting to do a few things to lose weight so i can sleep better and have more energy but i honestly don t know exactly where to start   to put things simply i work third shift  i leave the house at  pm and don t get back until   am and i do this from sunday to thursday  so by the time friday rolls around i m getting home in the early hours of the day and sleeping until   pm  so i honestly have a hard time setting a schedule to actually work out  my job is building and pulling pallets of upwards   lbs while rushing through the ware house so i am also exhausted by the time i get home   i keep thinking to my self i should do some push ups  but then never get around to doing them  i think about it but never do it  it always starts that way though  i should do this  but don t actually do it until i forget about it  i am done with that and want to better my life now   i also am very self conscious about doing any exercise thanks to my brothers always making remarks whenever i tried to do anything that wasn t normal as in sit around the house watching tv  hell i even went outside to do stuff but had a very very hard time to actually do them even though it was  in the morning and i was completely alone my wife and son asleep in side   while i was outside i did a bunch of googling to find beginner stuff and i found squats  after hyping my self up to even attempt to do them i couldn t do them  simply couldn t thanks to knee pain  i go down like how it shows and my knee hurts  did some more googling and i found that push ups are good  i can t do many of them so i used the outside steps to elevate a bit to make them easier and managed to do  sets of   felt slightly better but hesitant about doing more because of what if some one sees me and says something   looked more online and found lunges  again same thing  managed to do  sets of  on each leg  and now my legs are shaky very shaky  but it was easy just to do those even if i felt silly doing them outside and again what if some one saw me   i also know about walking and i am trying to do more of it from besides all the jogging i do at work   so all i m able to do is  sets of  push ups with using something to elevate my self and  sets of  squats each leg    i know this one was pretty much all over the place but i guess i m kind of looking for validation as well  something to help me get to do it every day   i m also looking for people to give me advice on what else i can do as a literal beginner for exercise  i don t live in a big place so there isn t a lot of room for me to do some stuff  does anyone have any resources to help a beginner get into doing it and to keep doing it   also on a side note is it ok to do lunges and push ups multiple times a day every day  i know i don t want to strain my self just starting out so i won t do it if it s not good to do

Exercise,myrtleeeb,self.Exercise,2019-06-16 15:13:59,how can someone who goes to the gym regularly to lift weights not be able to do ten pull ups  if you re like me who has been lifting weights for a couple of months already but still can t pull off the pull ups here s my trainer s explanation     pull ups are harder and more advanced than what the average people thinks people keep trying to compare pull ups and push ups when they re different but when you do pull ups you re literally holding and pulling   of your own body weight minus your hands and forearms when doing push ups you re only pushing   of your own body weight people who lift weights usually uses like less than   of the amount of their own body weight to do things like curls dumbbell rows seated cable rows and even on lat pull down you d barely use your own body weight and most people who does are usually just forcefully leaning all the way back and yanking on the cable attachment if they were to do it correctly they won t be able to do it because a lot of the average people at gym doesn t actually know how to lift weights properly as most of them have never been properly taught and they never bothered to spend time to do research     it will take a combination of two things to get your chin up over that bar    decreasing body fat so you have less weight to pick up   increasing strength to pick up your bodyweight and move above the bar     i realize doing those two things is much easier said than done   what most people don t realize is that they spend too much time on the strength part not realizing that decreasing their body weight is as important and impactful if not more so

Exercise,foxyburd,self.Exercise,2019-05-22 09:48:23,should you stop doing the plank if you re over    stop doing the plank if you re over       this was the provocative headline a social media page with a major influential presence posted last week     we along with many others approached her both in the comments and privately in dms expressing concern about the inaccurate information and its effect on the thousands of women who would read it kim schlag amp i contacted multiple pelvic health experts and had them weigh in     the original poster later updated the post to add some context stating the plank exercise puts pressure on the bladder which may already be weakened without the influence of oestrogen to prevent further damage modify the plank position by resting knees on the floor or speak with your instructor about alternative positions      yet her stance remained firm in all her comments and interaction on the post she stood by her claim that women should stop doing plank after  and did not even mention the possibility of strengthening the muscles to progress to doing plank     women over  were up in arms at being told they should not do an exercise and came out in droves to fight against this      so what s the deal what do the experts say about the safety amp benefit of planking for women   well the best way to handle bad information is to give you correct information     i co authored an article for you breaking down exactly what you need to know link in bio as well as in the highlights above  you ll learn     what the pelvic floor is amp how it works   how menopause may affect your pf amp what you can do about it  how to tell if planks are an appropriate exercise for you  how to do a good plank     remember this no matter what your age you are not fragile there is no such thing as an exercise for  year olds and an exercise for  year old it always depends on you as an individual your abilities training experience  amp goals ignore anyone who tries to tell you otherwise

Exercise,AetherCrux,self.Exercise,2019-01-13 03:47:37, new to exercise help with ghost abs   sorry for the cheesy title i didn t know what else to call the situation  if someone could confirm explain what s happening that d be great    i recently started exercising after an era of nothing i specifically downloaded a popular looking app  six pack in  days  i m on the second level so just under six pack level and over halfway through but something slightly weird is happening i have been getting a burn for the first half of a workout then the second half becomes exponentially easier i m imagining that natural painkillers are kicking in however for the past couple of days i not only can t feel my abs in the second half of the workout but i can t do even a single situp however if i keep my back on the floor i can still do reverse crunches no problem and don t feel anything  all i found on google was information about not feeling abs in relation to not getting a workout but the inability to do a situp plus the burn at the start indicates to me that this is not the case so i have some questions    am i going at it too hard too fast also considering the app ramps up gradually  are my assumptions correct or is something different probably happening if my assumptions are right why can i still do reverse crunches so easily   any answers would be greatly appreciated

Exercise,PlanetSupplement,self.Exercise,2018-07-20 13:57:54,exercise for beginners  men and women if you re a beginner and looking to start an exercise program its important to be aware of the different types of exercise training the forms of exercise conditioning and which exercises a beginner should start with before moving on to more advanced exercise routines or equipment   a good basic overview of the exercise essentials for beginners is to outline the various forms of exercise in an easy and simple format    aerobic exercise works the cardiovascular system of the body and helps to speed up the body s metabolism it is an important part of any weight reduction program a good rule of thumb on exercise for beginners is to start aerobic activity slowly and build up as you improve you fitness levels    strength training resistance or weight training involves gym or weight based workouts that focus on exercising the different muscles of the body this type of training can be focused on simple maintenance conditioning or strength and weight gain it also greatly assists in weight reduction if your just starting out its important to learn how to do the exercises correctly which body parts they exercise and how many repetitions and sets you should perform   there are other more specific exercise and fitness components such as flexibility training but this is a more advanced subject that is more relevant to professional athletes or individuals looking for improved sports performance at the beginner level individuals need to focus on getting a basic understanding of stretching and muscle preparation prior to engaging in aerobic exercise or strength based conditioning performing stretching prior to workout commencement not only prepares your body for more intense forms of exercise but greatly assists in improving your overall flexibility   if you re a beginner and not sure where to start you can purchase a basic exercise book which will introduce you to some simple stretches weight training and provide some additional guidelines for aerobic training a simple way to get a good introduction to exercise essentials for beginners is to join the local gym and have a professional instructor walk you through the various exercises this is a great way to learn by doing and is a quick way to for any beginner to get started and build up to a level where you can modify and design your own exercise workouts   an important aspect of health and fitness that beginners should investigate is how exercise and nutrition works together the exercise and nutrition https  planetsupplement com muscle building nutrition plan  section of this website has additional information on this    exercise for women  if your a female looking to start an exercise program it s not difficult to come up with some creative ways to get started whether you want to do exercise from home create a social group focused on exercise for women or join a gym getting setup with an exercise routine is as simple as starting out by walking and building up the pace as your tolerance levels improve   the range of exercises available to women is limited only by your imagination but is better defined by your personal goals and objectives start out by walking or if you want to do your exercise at home a skipping rope or some exercise equipment can be purchased and used to start your initial fitness program   some women like to combine a social aspect to their exercise routine so forming walking groups or attending aerobic workouts at your local gym provide a way to socialize with other individuals in a low key way with people who have similar objectives   if you want to investigate total body conditioning then consider joining a gym and soliciting the advice of a fitness professional who can introduce you to additional exercises for women walk you through the mechanics and provide ongoing consultation tailored to your objectives and body condition   home exercise for women can be scheduled around daily lifestyle requirements by appropriate use of fitness equipment video s that are designed with specific exercises for women stretching and other activities such as a skipping rope that can be operated effectively from the confines of your home environment if you need additional advice consider hiring a fitness professional who can tailor a set of exercises to suit the equipment you have available and your total body and exercise objectives   outdoor sporting activities or group based exercise for women can be organized by putting together a group of like minded individuals who can meet on a regular basis this is a great way to socialize and do your regular exercise at the same time       exercise for men  there are many different options available for men who want to exercise or start a fitness program to determine the best form of exercise for men you really need to be able to define your objectives   men who have been living a sedimentary lifestyle will benefit from any form of exercise and the best exercise for men in this situation is to simply start a regular exercise program running or walking is an ideal place to start and by building a basic foundation you can move onto other areas or activities that are more intensive   if your interested in total body conditioning then consider joining the local gym you can seek the advice of a qualified fitness professional who can introduce you to a range of exercises for men walk you through the mechanics and provide ongoing consultation and advice specifically geared towards your exercise objectives this is often a great way to learn and work towards getting a better understanding of the range of exercises available for men and to get advice on designing an exercise workout program   if your busy with work commitments then consider scheduling your exercise workout during you daily lunch break you can use facilities that are located close to where you work or simply hit the pavement and go for a run if your tight on time then you need to learn more about the economy of exercise this is a concept that can be employed once you have some basic conditioning levels in place this involves short sharp intensive exercise programs that can be performed in a very short period of time you might be surprise to know that a very effective exercise program for men can be performed in as little as  minutes
