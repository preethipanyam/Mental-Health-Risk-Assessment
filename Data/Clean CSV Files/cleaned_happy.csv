happy,Lopapeysaa,self.happy,2021-07-29 21:02:39,we finally said i love you to each other and it felt so cathartic  me and my boyfriend started out as a long distance situation started talking last september he flew to meet me in december and i moved back to the country he s from back in may that s when we started living together he always went the extra mile for me and i tried to do the same for him but until couple weeks ago we never said i love you to each other   so couple weeks ago we had a fight nothing crazy not our first one once we resolve things we usually cuddle and just give each other affection helps to let go of all the negative things accordingly after this argument he was holding me then he just squeezed me and told me he loved me i got flustered so i responded with a squeeze back and an aww  quickly followed by i love you too   my mind was racing he said it so casually and out of nowhere i thought that first i love you must not be of equal importance to him as it is to me  and in the moment i assumed that since we were already calling each other my love  he probably thought he had already confessed his love for me nevertheless i was happy   around a week goes by we go to visit his dad for a couple days it was my first time meeting him so quite a bit of anxiety day  goes great lots of good food great conversation and a lot of booze so by the end of the night i m in my feelings once we hit the hay i hug my boyfriend and tell him that i love him he squeezes me real tight and for much longer than he usually would so i ask what s up he says well it s the first time you said you loved me to skip the most of the following conversation he didn t hear me whisper the i love you too to him when he told me he loved me he was very nervous to say it in the first place and then thought i didn t say it back according to him he was happy to wait until i was ready to say it back since i gave a very positive response but knowing him i m   sure it was torturous for him to think we were not on the same level   i m so glad i said it that night i don t find it easy to tell people i love them a bit of an avoidant attachment style going on there yet it felt so good it felt good to just say it and it felt good to be able to tell him that i did say it back that day it felt good to show him that his feelings were reciprocated and appreciated and to tell him that i was waiting for a long time to either say it or hear him say it  having had a difficult childhood and adolescence where me displaying vulnerability and emotional pain was greeted by indifference and dismissals nowadays i still find it challenging to be vulnerable despite having worked out most of my other issues i have learned to depend on myself and only myself on pretty much all levels and saying i love you implies that to a certain degree i am willing to depend on and be attached to that person  it s not my first relationship and not my first time saying i love you  but for the first time it doesn t feel like an unhealthy addiction or a rushed decision i waited we waited and i m more comfortable in my vulnerability than i have ever been   he s more appreciative of my vulnerability than most people i ve considered family friends or lovers and i m very appreciative of his i m happy

happy,gummygummybear,self.happy,2019-01-26 00:04:04,finding out someone has a crush on you is a really happy thing  so i would consider myself an average looking person nothing special i never really have people hit on me or compliment me much so when i do receive any small kind of compliment it really means a lot to me but a few days ago i found out that a girl who i see every once in a while but have honestly never really talked to apparently has had a huge crush on me for a while and has been trying to come up with ways to ask me out i haven t seen her at all since i heard this but it just seems crazy to me that somebody out there could actually have a crush on me and want to ask me out like i guess i must be doing something right but i sure couldn t tell you what it is   i would ve never guessed in a million years that this girl would actually have a crush on me i think she s pretty cute so next time i see her i am definitely going to be paying more attention to her and hopefully we can set up a first date and see how things go   i ve been super stoked though ever since i heard this and honestly my whole world has seemed a little brighter this week so to all you people out there who have never had someone have a crush on you before i would like to say just keep doing you love yourself and be kind to those around you you never know who s watching you and you never know one of them might end up having a crush on you     amp x  b   tl dr i ve never had a girl admit to having a crush on me before but about a week ago i found out that a girl actually does i don t know her super well but i ve been on cloud  all week

happy,blessedarethegeek,self.happy,2019-03-28 13:03:28,after  years of being crushed in court and having to be the better person i got nearly full custody of my son  my son has always been attached to me over others  as a baby he d crawl around to find me or if i was holding him and his mother reached for him he d push her away and bury his face into my chest   the divorce with my ex wife was incredibly painful  i know there are two sides to every story and emotions run high during divorces  especially with children  but i was crushed at every turn without thought for what was best for my son  or for me  i was financially drained and then wrung out some more  i lived in fear of bills in the mail and i have lasting psychological damage when it comes to finances because of it   i m thankful for the time i was able to get with my son because it could ve been far worse  i was given roughly five days every other week that was years later increased to six days after an error on her part   i think the hardest part was being told to be the better person throughout all of it  especially because she wasn t  she had no problems bending the law as far as she could or talking trash about me to him  and through it all people told me to be the better person  so i did my best  never speaking ill of her to him and doing what i could with the time i had  even when she switched school districts mangling my commute and lessening the time i had i just kept going    as the years went on and he grew up he began to notice the differences between me and my ex  she would rarely spend time with him or pay attention to him  he was always secondary to her and her goals  i know she loves him in her way but she never put him first  there were car rides where he would get emotional and cry because her emotional absence or abuse hurt him   and that continued through the years  i fought in court uselessly when i could but continued to just enjoy my time with him when i had him   he s such a great kid and we always have that ease where we can talk about anything  i save up hilarious or interesting reddit posts to share with him we game together and he destroys me in fps games  we go hiking and camping and just enjoy life  i was there every time he needed me   a little less than a year ago his mother started a job her first basically after trying again and again to start her own businesses    six months ago she switched her work schedule to evenings  i only learned about it when my son texted me from school to ask to pick him up on one of her days  it took a while before his mother answered my calls or texts to where she told me i had to take him every weekday  no warning or care for my schedule or how the change would impact him  but that s typical   i took him  despite the extra driving and money still paying her child support despite now having him   of the time for food and everything else i took him and we had a blast with the extra time   i told my ex in february that she needed to either make the schedule permanent or switch back to a daytime schedule and actually be there for him i learned through our son that she was almost always dropping him off at her ex boyfriend s house on the two weekends a month she still had him as his mother  she said no and refused official mediation from the court parenting plan   so i filed for a modification requesting the change to be permanent    and i got it   i asked the court to make the schedule permanent listing all the things i ve done and why it should be changed   she never responded to the motion and didn t show up for court  the judge noted everything filled out papers and gave me custody  i can t quite describe how amazing that day was earlier this week  after ten years of struggling with it all  after her getting her way despite evidence of being a terrible mother  and now i had him   i d given him some heads up way earlier on what i was doing  as carefully as i could explain without painting her in a bad light i let him know i was working to try to keep the schedule as it was  sadly he was fine with it  she s damaged her relationship so far with him that he s perfectly happy with the extended schedule   i reaffirmed that the day i picked him up after the court s decision  for the remainder of this year he stays at his mother s house after school until i can pick him up  she lashed out at me to him telling him terrible things to paint me in a bad light  but after he told me about it in the car ride home he said it just all sounds like lies   i stayed the course over those ten years being the better person and raising him to be an empathetic kid  i taught him the best i could and it shows so well in how he deals with the world around him   there are a few times in my life where i ve just felt so incredibly happy and this is one of them

happy,frickfrackrslash,self.happy,2019-11-25 12:23:26,so i finally found my hallmark love story and i hope it lasts story below  ok so i just went through a break up where the girl was cheating on me oh well boo hoo i ended it before we got serious but then after a while i get a text from a girl i haven t talked to in  years ever since i moved an hour away and she wanted to meet up sometime i usually head near her town for a work out with the marines but still out of my way once a week for so never went there and last time i heard she had a boyfriend so wasn t going to go that route so when she wanted to meet up i canceled my plans on thursday and we made plans to go to a coffee shop in her town the coffee shop was christmas decorated and was breathtaking it had a vintage look with old tables and chairs that was wood and everything had a theme to it as well i waited for her really nervous and i saw her walk in beautiful as a sunset in the pasture on a warm night and we held each other pretty much with our hug and did not really ever let go we walked up to order coffee  we got toasted marshmallow hot chocolate instead and it tasted like fall we talked and i would always get lost in her beautiful blue eyes and we just laughed and we walked around outside for a bit and then the most magical moment happened we walked to the park across the street and it was cold so she came close and we leaned in and kissed it was the best moment of my life to date and i am now dating her i just wanted to talk about the moment to people and hopefully not annoy them so sorry if you hate this stuff but just wanted to talk about it

happy,lorsumipem,self.happy,2019-11-22 18:38:54,i m pretty sure my boyfriend just agreed to come to thanksgiving and it s the first time we ve spent the holidays together in  years about  months into our relationship  years ago was the first and last time my boyfriend and i did a holiday thing to introduce each other to our families after that i fell on hard times health wise and everything just unraveled   if he came to my house to pick me up i d invite him inside to wait while i finished getting my things and he d always opt to stay in the car when the holidays came round he usually didn t have plans with his family but declined to come to mine and said he d feel better being on his own   he s closer to my family than you d think for someone who has minimal interaction with them since when i was hospitalized they d comfort each other and talk about next steps he even had an ongoing text conversation with my mom about applying for his first mortgage and neither one of them told me about it until months after he bought his house my mom knew the sale went through before i did   i think the fact that we was forced to be at his most vulnerable with them has caused him to feel awkward about celebrating with us or it could very well be that not having plans with his own family makes him feel like i m extending a pity invite and hurts his pride   either way we talked about him coming to thanksgiving this year but when my mom texted me today to ask if he s coming i sent him a text playfully stating that because she asked me he s officially expected  at first he said he didn t realize it was next week and that it kind of caught him off guard which i assumed was his excuse to say no but i didn t pressure him just let it be then he said okay sounds chill what time    i m stoked i don t care if my nephew has   tantrums or if my mom fights with my stepdad for getting in the way in the kitchen i m just glad my whole family will be there because that s what he is to me   of course he can still back out and that s okay too but we re taking steps in the right direction

happy,-flyonwall-,self.happy,2020-01-28 13:24:36,my son got on the honor roll for the st time  to understand how huge this is for him i have to share a little back story my kid went to a very tiny private school since kindergarten with small classroom sizes amp where everyone knows eachother and their parents type environment   my kid struggled with being organized and writing down assignments he would often forget about upcoming tests or papers due i would find unfinished homework shoved in his unorganized notebook or in the back of his desk when i would meet with teachers they would share that often times after they have given the lesson and assign the in class work my son would look around and be clueless asking what are we doing how do we do this  etc the teacher would say  i just went over it with everyone  and sometimes they could go over again with him but sometimes the time wouldn t allow i remember studying with him for tests coming up only to find out he didn t do well many tears were shed school was hard for him and his confidence was starting to dwindle he started calling himself stupid and self harming himself which broke my mama heart because he is such a good kid he s kind to everyone respectful helpful and just a thoughtful person    after his th grade year the principal had a meeting with me about him and the upcoming th grade year she shared her concerns for his success amp highly suggested that i medicate him and to also hold him back amp repeat the th grade this was gut wrenching to hear his already low self esteem would certainly take a hit he wouldn t be with the same classmates he s had since kindergarten he would then also be in his younger brothers class who has no problems with school  and at this age kids are self aware and they talk i felt so distraught for him plus i didn t understand how repeating a grade and doing nothing else different was going to help him because this is such a small private school they can t accommodate or have the resources children that don t fit into the norm    i made the hard decision to pull him from the only school he s known and enroll him in the public school system which had the funding and resources available to help him he started his th grade year there it was awful hard on him everything was new new building new teachers kids and curriculum we soon started him on the evaluation process which took some time and eventually got him on his own ied plan  this was huge    come to find out my kid struggles with reading comprehension it s hard to do the assessments when you don t know what you just read also he gets anxious if he feels he s slower then the other kids so he wouldn t take his time to understand or do the assignment right amp just scribble something down to turn it in once we were able to find the problem we were able to address it and tackle it head on he had a team of supporters at this new school helping him how he needed it once the iep plan was put in place he thrived   well my kid is now in the th grade he has an iep plan in place and he is rocking it he finishes his homework on his own and he s getting a s amp b s it is so so sooo amazing to see his confidence built back up the school posted on fb the kids that made the honor role and for the first time in his life his name was on it my heart beamed with happiness for my son i know that changing schools as hard as it was on him was the best thing for him   i m so proud of my son it is truly a joy in life to see your children overcome an obstacle and succeed i am happy

happy,outlying_bounds,self.happy,2021-05-28 22:09:33,i had my high school graduation party today and loved it but i want to talk about one thing one person actually in particular that is just my everything even if i don t tell him it enough my uncle if you look in my post from almost a month ago i went into detail about how i was taken in and raised by my aunt and uncle after my parents passed in a car accident and that i was in the backseat when it happened the only inkling i have of that day is a small scar on my face from the glass that hit me but otherwise i got out of it okay but my parents never made it to the hospital i was officially adopted by them when i was  they also told me i was adopted and everything that happened when i was  from then on i stopped calling them mom and dad and just by their names or titles but i didn t love them any less of course   now i can honestly say that my childhood has been for better or worse good i never really had to deal with bullies or anything like that and have always been close with my family have a few close friends traveled a lot maybe had a bad breakup here or there but overall i was happy more often than not my home life was usually good also my aunt though the kind soul she is basically ran the house but not in a domineering or abusive way she was just a good motherly figure in general but i want to talk about my uncle more   if i had to describe his personality i d have to say he s usually quiet confident calm polite doesn t say a lot rarely if ever yells is kind of introverted but can talk at length with people he finds interesting enough and so much more though he never really adopted that dad lifestyle where he s super neighborly and wears khaki shorts and those new balance sneakers that just isn t him he s more of a working man always likes making stuff or doing home projects which makes sense since he grew up on a ranch and used to be a contractor but the one thing i love most about him is his unyielding and unconditional love he s always had for me   so let me explain every good parent loves their kids obviously and my aunt has always been there for me when i needed her i won t deny that but there s just something about my uncle s aforementioned characteristics that just always makes me feel  safe like even when he d hug me for two seconds when i came home from school it was just a welcome feeling being in his arms or if we had to go somewhere crowded and i hate being in crowds i had to hold his hand to keep myself calm and he never had a problem with it i also wasn t prone to panic attacks or meltdowns or anything like that but i had my moments of intense crying and anger over stuff and every time he was there if my aunt got to me first she d always help me at least calm down by just sitting with me and comforting me but my uncle would go a step further by holding my face to make me look at him and say baby i m here i m right here what s wrong  i d look at him with such fire and fury but quickly go back to sadness before he d pull me in for a hug nd i d cry on his shoulder again just remaining calm the whole time like he always does he always made time for me and never seemed like i was inconvencieing him when i had to come to him with my problems   the lengths he would go to for just the smallest things to make me happy is something i ve always loved also for example for my  th birthday he got me a secret gift  so called because he gave it to me after everyone left my party he brought me in the living room and sat me down what he gave me was one of those necklaces that you open up and it has tiny photos inside the photo on the right was of me and my parents when i was a baby and the one on the left was me and my aunt and uncle from when i was i think   one of my favorites of us and also the same one they have framed in their bedroom i looked at him with the biggest smile on my face and he innocently asks with such a loving and hopeful tone in his voice like always  you like it  i nearly passed out from crying so many happy tears as i hugged them both as tight as i could even writing about it here has my eyes welling up   i know these kind of sappy feel good stories get posted here all the time but i don t care i have something to get off my chest and this is it my love for him can t even really be put into words it wouldn t be good enough whatever a perfect dad is he s it he s the only dad i ve ever known and even though i m gonna be  soon he still manages to call me his baby girl sweetie honey angel you name it always without a second thought like i said in the beginning he s everything to me always has been and always will be

happy,frosty_eloquence,self.happy,2021-05-27 12:06:48,i helped a co worker build his first gaming pc last weekend it was honestly the most fun i ve ever had doing something in a long time now let me preface this by saying simply i ve never built a pc for myself either that s right i was a newbie myself i have a laptop that does everything i need it to and that s it i don t like playing video games on pc either i m a console person but i do have some experience in replacing pc parts as i work the help desk at my company i can replace any needed hardware inside a desktop as needed even a motherboard and get it all working as needed even if a pc goes down in our office i can usually diagnose what the issue is fairly quickly and replace what i need if we have the parts   so my co worker jin put out an e mail to our help desk e mail group asking if someone could help him build his first pc once all of his parts come in i stepped up and said i d help because  well i don t really know why jin is a sweetheart and just one of those people that it kills you to make fun of even in a genuinely lighthearted way so last saturday i get to his place and bring my own toolbox and legit the first words to me after he said hi were oh good i only have a screwdriver  now that wouldn t be a problem if he also didn t mention that he wanted to build a fuc ng desk also but again because i m so generous i helped him   we spent about an hour and a half putting together his desk and it was a lot of jin hand me that  no not that one the other one  stuff like that and he was having a laugh but i guided him through building and he put the legs on all by himself like a big boy s and eventually it was all done now onto building the pc   so we both at least knew how to assemble parts on the board and i let him put everything in place but his biggest mistake was wanting to put the board in the case immediately and i stopped him the reason is because what you want to do is check and see if any of your parts are doa dead on arrival before putting it all in the case and having to take everything apart again so we jumped it by just turning on the psu power supply unit and shorting some pins with a screwdriver to get it to post and get to the bios screen on his monitor thankfully everything was working fine and we finished the build in about an hour even got him sweet rgb lights inside the case and then to thank me for helping him he bought mcdonalds for me   honestly this is probably the most fun i ve ever had doing basically anything for the longest time i don t really spend time with other people outside of work i come in do my work then leave end of story it was nice to i guess break the monotony for once and do something productive with someone and learn some stuff along the way if i had one friend in this world the closest would probably be jin

happy,redrocketinn,self.happy,2020-11-26 14:19:42,i m pretty sure i just solved a mystery that has been bothering me since i could remember so apparently when i was younger around pre pre school and throughout up until grade school maybe i had a girlfriend  there s a few pictures of us together but my parents said we always hung around each other   from time to time whilst looking through my old photographs i would see those pictures and wonder  who the heck is this girl where is she now what even is her name   my parents didn t know as it was a long time ago   well yesterday i scanned all of my pictures into my computer to have them safe that s when i noticed in one of the pictures there were name placards on the table i finally had a name and for some reason it hit me a name of someone i had spent my entire schooling with came to me   i immediately go to messenger to ask her if she was in the same pre school as me that s when i looked at her profile picture and compared that with the childhood pictures they look extremely similar like strikingly   the only problem is we were never really that close growing up different cliques and such   but it s just crazy to me that this entire time of wondering who and where she was she was right there with me the whole time that is of course if it s actually her   for now i m patiently waiting for her response

happy,AnonPinkLady,self.happy,2022-01-25 19:01:13,three months ago i was a self destructive jobless alcoholic today i am lively sober and a top performer at my sales job about to be promoted to a permanent position three months ago i hit rock bottom when i drank so much i had to be hospitalized in the hospital i was evaluated by a social worker and determined to be emotionally unstable and overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts and risky behaviors i was hooking up with strangers even though i was too depressed to ever feel excited sexually i was hung up on past lovers i was crying in the shower at night before bed and dragging bottles to my bed to drink all hours of the day i was developing alcoholic tendencies i didn t always drink but when i did i couldn t stop and would entirely forget about my limit until i was sobbing and vomiting one day i went out to a bar and drank and drank until i collapsed on a bathroom floor in tears and vomit the bartender in a panic called   i was carried out on a gurney and brought in an ambulance and there i was in the hospital after  hours of laying in a bed being tended to by a nurse with large glasses and a charming sense of humor reading a book by tina fey because my phone had been confiscated spilling out the truth of how badly i just wanted to die that was when it was decided by the social worker that i had to be put in a psychiatric ward while i recovered from my alcoholic tendencies and constant thoughts of suicide     during my short three days in the psychiatrics ward i was prescribed a new medication and all the hobbies dreams and hopes i had given up were encouraged to be revived doctors noted that in all my harmful behaviors there were elements of self isolation and loneliness and that i needed more than anything i needed to be surrounded by others that cared beyond the care at the hospital was an inexplicable thing it was if something had just clicked and i realized so strongly and profoundly the simple truth that i wanted and still deeply want to live when i got out i quit alcohol completely resumed my old hobbies opened my own website started a new job and moved into a larger nicer apartment i began enjoying activities again such as drawing animation video games and quickly moved onto buying a vr headset and engaging in opportunities to form friendships again in the last few months my numbers have gone up and up at my sales job and i m now at one of the highest percentages of transfer in my sales team by the end of next week i ll become a permanent member of the company and no longer a temp employee i no longer drink and don t feel a temptation to i don t cry anymore or feel depressed my discord server that i began shortly after leaving the hospital is living and full of caring friends i even met someone special suicidal thoughts are almost completely gone i m so happy for three years i thought life wasn t worth living and now i am happy again i can t believe it

happy,huntsman_459,self.happy,2021-03-16 20:56:06,i did what my wife always wanted to and am in the final steps of getting our first house a two story single family home in the suburbs that will still allow our daughter to go to the same school she does now and is honestly just perfect in every way my wife passed away a year ago and we always dreamt of owning a house even if it was just the three of us i honestly can t even express how happy this whole situation makes me   i took a tour of it a few months ago with my daughter and i myself fell in love with it immediately it has just about everything we could ever need from a space perspective and also has spare bedrooms that i especially want to have a home office in one it s nothing too big but i know my wife would be more than satisfied if she could see it   though obviously my girl was a little less than thrilled about the prospect of moving at first for one obvious reason she s never moved before the apartment we re at now is all she s ever known though i got some advice from both my family and others on this site about how to possibly get her more on board with wanting to move since her mom s passing was still on her mind so i had an idea and am going to not only let her paint and decorate her room however she wants i m also going to give her some things that belonged to her mom one is an old fashioned makeup mirror or whatever it s technically called that she had when she was growing up and the other is a jewelry box with a ballerina in it that was actually my wife s grandmother s i showed both of them to her and immediately i saw a change in her i also told her i d let her paint both of them on her own if she wants   home inspection has already been done and nothing noteworthy to affect the sale was found since the owners had been taking exceptional care of it since they moved in even adding on to it in a few places my landlord also knows about the move and the timing was extremely important since my lease ends this month and he s basically gonna give me a month or so to move everything out once it s up   but honestly the thing that made this all easier is my girl ever since i told her about her getting my wife s mirror and jewelry box she s been significantly more into the prospective move she s been a little forlorn though just knowing how many memories she s had here and it s shaken me up a bit too this is the same place we brought her home from the hospital to when she was born where almost all of her birthdays have been and so much more but i know my wife lives on through her so she s never far away

happy,AnchoredEnclosure,self.happy,2021-03-16 02:31:08,my daughter said i love you too to me for the first time since me and my wife divorced we love our daughter she s  btw  we just don t love each other that s honestly the best way to describe the relationship at this point we look at each other and we know there s just nothing there anymore no deep yearning love like when we first met but no hostility either we see each other as good friends who genuinely care about each other but leave it at that needless to say the divorce was amicable we each had our own attorneys for representation s sake but the filing was fairly straightforward and our visitation agreements between our daughter was agreed upon   i have to thank my now ex wife for making it significantly easier for our daughter to comprehend and make peace with she really was able to get through to her much easier than i was she made it clear that none of it was her fault not in the slightest and that we both loved her equally the hardest thing was just us not being together she couldn t quite wrap her head around that even though her ears had to listen to some of the more intense arguments we had between me and my wife   anyway getting back on track we had just finished dinner together and my daughter was still on that tipping point being a little withdrawn since the separation but not fully shutting me out either she went to her room and i was doing dishes and i hear her screaming over the phone at someone the angriest i ve ever seen her i go to her door but then stop myself and just think let her get it out  and so i just stand there listening to her call someone a fu ing cu t  bi ch  you name it and i m just like woo man hate to be on the other end of that call  eventually things go quiet and i slowly open the door she immediately tells me to fuck off but i can tell she doesn t mean it she s just angry at the world   so i sit down next to her and just very calmly ask her what happened here s the jist some girl from school that she was in a group chat with said that her mom must be happy to be out of the house and is probably already with another guy because i supposedly wasn t keeping her my wife  satisfied enough and also that they d probably still be together if it wasn t for her my daughter  yes another  year old kid said that hand to god and then my daughter basically gave the you have no idea what you re talking about rebuttal and layed into her defending me in some way there s more to it but that s essentially what went down some girl tried being a troll for shits and giggles   as she s going into more detail she s on the verge of tears and i just hold her hand and scoot closer to her telling her that none of it is true and that she shouldn t listen to her even though she s nodding her head in agreement she kicks her nightstand out of anger and knocks a glass over and it shatters and she screams fuck at the top of her lungs this sends her over and i take the opportunity and just hold her tight against my chest as she bawls her eyes out screaming and crying at the same time after she wraps her arms around me all i can think to do is let her carry on just softly repeating it s okay baby i m here and it s gonna be okay baby it s gonna be okay and i nearly start crying just seeing her like this   she starts coughing from crying and yelling so much and i just rub her back and kiss the top of her head over and over to help her calm down she eventually gets to a point where she isn t crying anymore and is just staring out into the hallway i let the silence just sit there for a few moments before i get her to look at me and stare directly into her eyes and say i love you sweetie you re gonna be okay and kiss her forehead before she says i love you too and i smile warmly but she doesn t smile back yet i still just hold her close and we sit in silence   i know this was probably a build up from all her anger and rage she was holding in since the separation and i don t blame her for being that way at all after she finally was really calm i asked her if there was anything she wanted to talk about but she said no i reminded her that she can talk to me about anything and we just kind of left it at that   i know we have a lot to work through but i m confident she ll come to terms with the whole thing one day and if she wants to do something like therapy to help her i ll be there for her    anything to make her happy

happy,carinace,self.happy,2020-05-24 23:36:13,bestfriends for  years and then we got together cute inspiring i hope so story of my love life   i m in a relationship with my bestfriend he was my friend for  yrs until we finally got together   back in college he was my buddy he was the guy who would always make me laugh but i try to hide the smile laughter anyway he always made sure that i would know his favorite songs and carefully put the other earphone on my right ear so we could hear his fave song together i would pretend being annoyed by that gesture but deep inside i was exploding with happiness and kilig  a filipino term for giddiness  i ve witnessed his heart breaks his shallow relationships and he was there when i got into my first serious relationship i was so happy with my relationship i was distracted making it work and i forgot about my best friend he transferred to a different school far away from me from his college buddies he became a different person to me as months and years go by the only updates that i heard about him was stories ridiculous stories from our mutual friends   we went through different relationships bouncing in and out of relationships for  years until we found each other again he was different different from the party guy i ve known from the stories of our friends he grew his hair long even his facial hair he s wearing black everyday he smiles only timidly now not the guy i knew in college that would smile widely he was in a place in his life where he s really focused on doing what he wanted to do he didn t care about the opinions and judgements of others he knows his true self now   he found me at the time of rising up from a loss i just got out of my nd relationship it was pretty serious i thought i would die  now i know that i wouldn t a week before we talked again i went to a  day vacation away from the city i went to ilocos to do some soul searching i came back happy i came home thinking that i could be happy again without my ex and i really did so going back a week later my best friend commented on my post and then we chat through the comment box and moved our conversation to messenger app we talked all day all night about random things about life about politics about food  everything i felt like we re in college again we talked everyday and i noticed how fond i am with him even though he s miles away he didn t leave me hanging too we confessed our feelings to each other and it went smoothly it felt natural it felt like it could happen even before months passed by and we officially became a couple the happiness we ve felt that time is still the same and grew even more today and everyday   there are times that i would cry because of happiness and gratitude that he s in my life we understood each other and we held on to each other no matter what i ve never felt love this way before i ve never known someone as much as i know him and he knows me too that well everything was worth it every heart break every disappointments every downfall because it led me to finding him again and love him like i never loved anyone else before   i hope all of us will find the happiness we all deserve even if we went through some hard times there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel just keep praying hoping loving and living

happy,butidontwantausern,self.happy,2020-07-23 09:13:48,i feel like lots of the posts lately have a silver lining and even if they are meant as something positive they come off as really negative  hello everyone i do not know if i am alone with this but i want to mention it   lately there have seen a lot of posts saying stuff like for the first time happy in a long time or i am struggling so much but i am happy at the moment or my life has been so bad but i am happy at the moment and then explaining why their life is so bad  you get the idea i think this is also against the sub rules as it says no silver linings  tbh the longer i am in this sub the more depressed it makes me i usually feel awesome all the time and reading these stories doesn t make me feel good it makes me feel sorry for the person it totally kills my mood and enthusiasm as much as i am happy for these people and wish for their best i can t help but feeling sorry for them   i know this is kind of a depressing post itself but i want to see if other people feel the same if it s fine for everyone i guess i just need to move on from this sub in order to keep my positivity thank you all for reading and understanding also i d like to know how you guys feel about this have a nice and positive day

happy,Buutchlol,self.happy,2019-02-24 04:20:35,after almost  years of depression and very many ups and downs im now for the first time in my life positive about the future  high school for me was a very eye opening and intense experience in a way that i started realizing stuff about myself other people and the world and it felt like it all happened too quick for me to process it all correctly   up until hs i didnt really worry about anything i very rarely studied and still passed with good grades i had many good friends i hung out with a lot and i was a nice but a little shy and scared kid   when i started hs all that shit changed i dont know if it was because i started growing up or if it was just a totally different environment than i was used too but all off a sudden i was thinking about stuff i never ever had thought about   my train of thought had suddenly changed over what felt like a night and a lot of new impressions people thoughts lessons etc entered my life and i believe i got overwhelmed   i realized i had picked the worst fucking direction in school i picked a technology oriented class for my  years that i thought was a perfect fit for me but i liked the people in my class and decided to stick with it how hard can it be right   hard af i started failing tests and later grades i became the class clown and started partying a lot i also played a lot of wow back then and that evolved into me staying home from school playing wow because i hated waking up early to sit in a class that i wasnt going to study for anyway   my mom left her bf someone that i looked up to a lot and he was more of a dad to me than my actual dad about this time and we moved into the city this resulted in my mom being a little more loose with rules and i ended up with a lot of responsibility maybe a bit too much for me back then   i became a full blown aimless slacker who graduated school with  failed grades and up until about  weeks ago ive had a ton of different jobs that never ended in something real ive done a lot of drugs and many times prioritized them over life ive lied cheated and ignored way too much stuff and ive been overall very unhappy about my life since my nd year in hs basically   the last  months ive been unemployed because im lazy and i have no idea what i want to do with my life wich made me hate my life even more and ive borrowed so much money from my family that i wasnt sure i was ever going to be able to pay it back or even sustain myself any longer   but  weeks ago my dad asked me if i wanted to help out at his job he works as a carpenter wich i have some experience in  i obviously said yes even tho i had to get up at   in the morning and do physical labor all day and the money i would make wouldve payed my rent for another month   i ended up working the whole week and on friday that week his boss asked me if i wanted to work there full time my first thought then was no thank you im not getting up this early every fucking day no way  so i told him id think about it and have an answer on sunday   but then i started thinking about the past  years and how fucking miserable theyve been and i also realized i felt really fucking good about myself i did something that actually mattered for once and i felt happiness something that often got shadowed by worries about money the future my relationships etc so i texted my dad and told him to tell his boss that id be happy to work there   ive now worked   for  weeks and i havent been this happy about myself in a long fucking time theres literally  worry in my head im for the first time in my life thinking and making plans about the future i feel like a real human being now someone that actually contributes something to society and someone that people can trust and ask for help with real stuff   i just realized this became waaay longer than i planned and hopefully someone reads some or even all of it im just  so  fucking happy about everything and im also a little drunk   i just want to shared my happiness with everyone and perhaps even give some people hope that its not going to suck forever thank you for reading  lt

happy,whiteandafrikan,self.happy,2019-10-25 04:21:32,i still can t believe how far my life has come my dream is almost complete if i can do it anyone can sorry mobile user  bad formatting sorry   my life for  years was a trainwreck i was forced into sports by my father a man who beat my mother weekly the man who beat me so badly i was taken out the orange county  orlando fl  public school systems and homeschooled why you ask oh i firstly had trouble sitting from a beating i took and it was apparently time for me to focus on tennis anyway because i was going to be a profession  this was my fathers dream for me to be his hollywood kid i had have a nack for tennis i guess  by  years old i was spending  to  hours a day either training off the court or practicing with my personal coach other hitting partners i was running miles daily and calculated food intake was a must i went to school at home mostly my mother filling things out and giving me the absolute minimums i was getting decent at this tennis thing and welp i guess they chose to send me away to tennis  academy  it was horrifying i m  ish years old a top player in florida top  in my age group in the country living with kids    and  year olds from all over the globe i go to school in a room alone with a laptop and that s fucking it i played tennis for  to  hours a day hitting the gym for  hours a day then finally going for a run for an hour before completing  hours of school i played for years different academy same story i was top in the usa for a good portion of my youth and played numbers tournaments while traveling the country i played a few professional tournaments as a minor and did pretty well  i had full ride offers to a fist full of schools and sponsors ready to talk money all the while my mother s being beaten daily along with me losing was given public and private beatings  loss at the tournament are seen as an embarrassment to my father  the beatings last so long once he hit me in the head and face from clearwater to orlando in the car he hit me so hard by surprise i couldn t block any of it that i swear my one eyes bigger because the other one never opened correctly again after the swelling went down i once had full body craps to which he punched me for swearing in pain begging for salt pills and a fucking doctor he broke his phone on my nose once the kicker was i didn t lose  i simply didn t win by enough this is a small sample of my horrifying run with tennis and so i digress by  i put the racket down and the my father explained i was no longer his son by  i wasn t small anymore my father who was still just as aggressive had less of an edge over me but i still haven t made any pushback during my beatings i started smoking weed at   no big deal  i never stopped   i had met a girl on plane who exchanged emails with me we chatted for a bit and started talking on the phone long story short i said fuck it packed s bag and said i want to leave spoke to my mother then my father we had a nice little fist fight and i got a plane ticket out their life fast forward a bit and i m now living in jersey with a chick  years older than me that relationship fizzled and i m back in vegas living in a bathroom stall in an apartment complex pool i m walking down the road and who the fuck do i see  andre and diane  my parents   my parents moved to vegas from florida while i was up north  they force me in the car and off i go home to live again i m forced to work with him in timeshare  lpt that shits for selling not buying never ever buy one ever  he was head of sales department so yup i was selling that garbage i meet another chick she was in timeshare so i should have know she was nuts lol we live together and she s super crazy i m honestly not badmouthing her

childhood so i say why not pack a bag and go with we go have an amazing time had no clue my wife would be on that trip with me no clue that my life changed with that trip the trip started with two people who both had relationships outside the trip and turned into two people going home to pack their items and meet the other to start their new life together i continued to struggle with my childhood internally i was a mess my fathers manipulative behavior continued to draw me in empty promises and straight lies his abusive behavior stopped with his hands and intensifies on an emotional and social level he hated my newfound relationship and tried to chip away at it any chance he got i d need   pages to go into all the shit the man has done i ate my feelings and weighted in over   pounds i flinched at fast hand movements even from my children i was depressed snd had plans to commit suicide i had a rocky relationship with my wife i sucked as a personal i was violent  never to my now wife and kids  in general i was aggressive i guess i manipulated everyone to get what i wanted i cheated on my wife regularly i lied for fun and had become numb to causing pain to others i had

happy,raintosun,self.happy,2019-10-24 16:40:16,i m glad alex morgan s unborn child is a girl i don t care how much hate i get for this i believe that alex morgan s child being a girl is a good thing for women s rights as crazy as it may sound specifically in sports here s why   as most of you know women are extremely underpaid in sports like soccer football  basketball etc now here s the thing about genetics that child will most likely in the very least have an above average ability in athletics at the most a world class athlete who could go down as the greatest of all time this is what the world needs another empowering female figure who can dominate in sports and further prove that they deserve more money and rights in sports i m not hating on males please don t take it that way   i m just saying that in her particular situation having a girl will benefit women s rights in the best way possible because of the odds of her having a supreme athletic ability that may necessarily be pointless if she had a boy heck i wouldn t mind if the rest of her children if she has anymore are girls because that could mean even more to our fight just think about a trio of sisters on the best team in the world promoting equal rights nothing would stop them and that is my take on this feel free to comment dissenting opinions

happy,NickJolter,self.happy,2019-11-18 20:04:52,learning this simple concept made me happier than i ve ever thought i would be this is an excerpt from my personal journal any time i feel lost or discouraged i consitently find myself coming back to it reading these words inevitably fill me with motivation and clarity on what s the reasonable next step to take hopefully this can help many other fellow humans to experience more fulfilment and happiness in their own lives   here s the main concept   lasting happiness fulfilment can only happen through a holistic system of good habits   and these are my personal reflections about that     habits are the success tool of nature    inconsistency leaves no room for long term successful outcomes if there wasn t a consistent component to evolutionary natural selection it would not be possible to successfully carry a species through hundreds of thousands of years and since humans are a byproduct of nature s systems it appears self evident to me that the same principle applies in relation to successful outcomes of human endeavors   good habits  consistent successful progress csp   csp  happiness   i shouldn t simply ask myself why i m not consistently happy or at least content  the real important question is   what crucial good habits both mental amp physical am i lacking   of course a context of well being for myself and others it s implied and i clearly can t include any form of addiction in that context although they can feel so good to to the point of fooling my mind into rationalizing even obviously destructive habits in a well being context   even a slightly approximately correct answer to that question can save me from a whole life of unnecessarily added misery and struggle so it s probably wise to spend some real good time thinking about it    and to quote a consistently wiser dude than me   we are what we repeatedly do excellence then is not an act but a habit    aristotle   and here s another quote if i need some extra motivation   it gets easier every day it gets a little easier  but you gotta do it every day that s the hard part  but it does get easier    bojack horseman     of course it s crucial to be aware that some degree of tragedy and pain are a virtual inevitability of the human condition so i m not in any way implying that good habits will solve all of my problems although they can and will make my problems significantly more tolerable  there are obviously many things that i can t directly control and in many of those instances it s clearly not useful to think in mainstream terms of mere success but more in terms of successful acceptance and emotional healing   i m just saying that if really i really want the best possible life i get having the best possible habits it s probably your my bet   to that many people could say   well no sh t sherlock how is that revolutionary news   and my answer is   just look around    and honestly count how many people truly dedicate most or even a small chunk of their daily time to the understanding and development of the best possible habits they can get it will inevitably be an extremely marginal percentage of people and it shouldn t come as a shock that virtually all of those people are among the most successful humans to ever walk the face of the earth   so now stop complaining like a little b tch that s upset cuz daddy won t pay for the new justin bieber album she wants and get your lazy netflix lover a s back in the game by taking the very best next step you can take with what you got even a daily  improvement can completely change your life in a few months can you even imagine that version of you in a few years   future me will thank me   please don t disappoint future me we both know how bad it feels to disappoint that guy

happy,smileycat,self.happy,2020-01-22 13:27:32,my dreams are coming true life may be hard but it can be wonderful too  long  i am not a person who likes to brag so most of the time i ve always been very low key about my accomplishments in fact i have always been self deprecating so that others will be more accepting of me this is a habit i ve been actively trying to stop because i shouldn t have to downplay my success in order to be liked but the fact is i don t really have friends or much family to share with and the friends and family i do have seem to not enjoy my successes with me i thought maybe i could share it with you fine people i ve heard of how awesome this community can be and even though i m scared of getting even more negativity thrown at me i m going to do it anyway fear is a part of living right  so both my husband and i come from very humble beginnings he grew up in a trailer park with young and inexperienced but loving parents who taught him the value of hard work but had no experience with money i grew up moving a lot between states with parents that should have had money due to good career choices but were always struggling due to poor decision making i was also subjected to sexual abuse from the time i was born until i was  from my grandfather and received little positive affection during my developmental years  that being said when i met my husband my first dream came true we met and married young i was fresh out of high school and he was a senior in high school a lot of people out there believe that if they are in a committed relationship too early they will miss out on a lot of things life has to offer and while that may be true for them it hasn t been for us we ve grown into adults together experienced wild and crazy things together have had sexual adventures together traveled together failed and learned together no topic has ever been off limits and no experience is off the table with us we also never had children and neither of us ever wanted them after being married for  years and having only one major fight in our first few years of marriage i can say that i believe we are soul mates i know a lot of people don t think they exist but we do we re just extremely rare i think the larger the population gets the rarer we become  anyway we set life goals together early on neither one of us was used to having any kind of money growing up and having nice things were few and far between we didn t really have any huge life dreams we wanted to achieve i honestly just wanted to be loved and to be safe and to have a home maybe if i were to dream big that home would have a pool maybe even an inground pool  so we set up our plans and thankfully my husband was born with this ability to manage money as he certainly wasn t taught how to over the years he s taught me so much about how to handle finances and has helped his family learn and achieve as well his instincts were always spot on and instead of planning out some huge dream scenario we paid attention to the opportunities that would come our way and together discussed whether to take them or pass on them  over the years we put on some weight and i began to develop some health issues which put a strain on things but never to the point i was ever worried about our happiness thanks to my husband and his researching skills he found the keto diet and i ve lost  lbs already and am working on my last  now i feel amazing and have more energy and confidence in myself than i ever have before he also has lost  lbs and looks fantastic he always carried his weight well and was never fat like i think i was but together we re now living our best life we are more active and capable after all this time together he s still the only man i fantasize about and want to be with and i m thankful daily to have him in my life   he ended up purchasing an existing business from a man who was ready to retire and a year after that another business associate wanted to retire so he bought that business and merged them together i ended up quitting my job receptionist work so nothing i went to school for or honestly cared too much for and joined him at the business and so my second dream become a reality now we operate it together and i have found that not only do i enjoy it i m really good at it too i wake up in the morning and for the first time in my life i don t dread going to work i don t lay there and wonder if i could play hooky without getting fired or in trouble and i have discovered that all the people i had worked with and bosses that i had over the years that tested me in some way shape or form have in fact taught me a valuable skill that i utilize in the operation of this business everything ended up meaning something  during all the time that we were building up to the business dream we bought and sold our first home at a profit just skating in under the wire of the   housing crisis we continuously lived as far below our means as we were comfortable with and without children we were able to save a lot and invest it wisely i can honestly say that we are both very lucky people but we also worked very very hard to achieve our goals we didn t just let life happen to us we planned it we worked at it and we never stopped trying to go forward we earned this life that we made and i am so excited  this year is the year we are going to build our dream house with a pool maybe even an inground pool we ve picked the plans and are choosing our builder and looking for the date to break ground our next dream is really going to come true and i am so excited i can hardly stand myself  thank you for reading i feel like i ve been busting at the seams with happiness and wanted to share with someone anytime i ve tried to share my joy with those physically in my life i ve been met with silence or they change the subject back to them it s gotten to the point where i feel like i cannot share the good or the bad with anyone i wish all of you could feel what i feel and that your lives are filled with joy and happiness as well

happy,yellingsnowloaf,self.happy,2020-01-22 12:32:59,i m getting laid off at my job this week but everything is going to be ok because my spouse is a wonderful partner  back story when i was a kid both of my parents were pretty severe alcoholics the ended getting divorced and stayed alcoholics for a very long time it was hard i took care of my younger sister a lot we went to soup kitchens a lot it sucked i m not mad at my parents or anything i ve dealt with those feelings and at least understand why they were like that but i had gotten so used to taking care of myself and others because that s pretty much all i knew i was dumb and married a guy who basically wanted a mom forever i worked he stayed home and did nothing i cleaned the house grocery shopped cooked managed the bills and whatever else after realizing that he was not going to change and i deserve better i ended our relationship for the next few years it was me handling everything in my life and that s fine   after my spouse and i had been together for awhile he relocated to where i lived and it took a few months to find a job he managed the house in the meantime so that was nice he got his dream job and everything has been great   now i m getting laid off unemployment isn t nearly as much i make at my job and there s no time frame for when the lay off will end i feel like i have to jump into action and get this handled by myself asap because that s what i ve always done out of necessity finding a job that pays well enough in the industry that is doing the lay offs is not an easy task so i m panicking i m not going to make enough money i m so fucked   cue the good spouse i m venting to him about my panic and he nonchalantly tells me don t sweat it we ll get through this just fine together  and he means it he s ok with picking up my slack because that s what partners do it feels so good and so foreign to actually have someone i can rely on someone who can and will actually help and will help for the first time in so long i feel like i m not handling life alone and it s comforting

happy,Spudblood,self.happy,2020-02-23 02:47:47,finally have some good people in my life okay so the backstory for this is pretty long sorry about that i have adhd so i get pretty rambly sometimes   so like i just said i have adhd and i also have a few other mental disorders that can be really challenging sometimes so my school offers something called an iep i honestly don t know if i ever learned what it stands for and if i did i don t remember for those students which basically gives them extra help like giving them more time on tests   so i have an iep and students with an iep are able to go to a special study hall or are forced to in my case  where it s basically study except there s less students and more teachers and they re always making sure you re doing work and help students more   this special study hall has a name but because it s specific to my school i don t really want to share it anyway these sshs that s what i ll call them from now on are all over the school and include students from all grades and i ve made a lot of friends with the other people in my ssh and there s even a group chat among most of us in our ssh   okay sorry for that backstory it was way too long can you tell it s   am here anyway   so a week ago i walk in to this ssh and one of the tas there are  tas there jokingly says oh no it s my name  and my friend responde with no it s the opposite  and it made me feel really good   i have anxiety so i constantly feel like i m saying doing the wrong thing and that my friends don t like me but hearing him say something like that really warms my cold and shriveled heart   it just makes me really happy to know my friends or at least that one friend feel the same way about me as i do about them   my life hasn t been particularly easy or fun but this year i think i m learning from my past mistakes becoming a better person and finally starting to get over my depression and knowing that i have people like that by my side really helps me through my daily struggle   i applaud you for getting to the end of this and hopefully everyone reading is will be as blessed as i am or even more so

like doing yoga every day though both can help a study of   men conducted by harvard allowed this question to be studied what is the best investment of time and energy now for our future health and happiness it turns out to be relationships    the study  the study tracked participants health and happiness over a  year period  and the single best indicator of happiness and health in later life was the strength of individuals relationships  building and maintaining strong relationships will be better for your health than more money or prestige most of the time   when we try and discover the impacts of decisions on our future health we often try to work backwards we start with an older individual then use the fallible tool of memory to isolate decisions and trends from their life that led them to where they are now the use of memory often results in errors because memory is fallible   this study attempted to bypass this problem by tracking the people as they grew up recording decisions health happiness and wealth year by year it s called the harvard study of adult development    the harvard study of adult development   in   the study began it followed   men the   s weren t great at gender equality through their lives the participants came from all parts of the societal strata upper middle and lower class   one group of boys were specifically selected as sophomores year  here in australia from harvard college while another group of the boys were selected from boston s poorest neighbourhoods the boys from these areas came from mostly disadvantaged backgrounds   the study measured health happiness financial success aspirations and dreams they routinely checked in year after year sending out another questionnaire sitting them down for yet another interview today most of the participants have passed away but the study continues to track their children and grandchildren   robert waldinger the current director of the study and fourth director in total presented a ted talk watched by millions on their findings  https  www ted com talks robert waldinger what makes a good life lessons from the longest study on happiness language en    the findings  this study allowed the future consequences of many actions to be measured does more money make you happier do cholesterol levels in your mid  s have a correlation to health in later life   now these answers are almost

what this study has allowed researchers to do is find the best indicator of future health and the best indicator found was the quality of individuals relationships the people with better quality relationships were happier and healthier    the power of relationships  three of the most important findings from the study were      social connections are good loneliness kills  social connections are really good for humans we evolved as social animals in tribes therefore we need close and strong social connections and the lack of connection or loneliness kills when isolated we suffer terribly investing in relationships are key participants who had strong social connections were happier and healthier      it s the quality of relationships that matters most  deep trusting relationships were the best indicator of future health not the number of relationships the men with the highest satisfaction in their relationships not the most relationships at  were the healthiest at     amp x  b

cognitive abilities loneliness and poor relationships either don t inhibit or potentially cause quicker memory loss    why is this surprising to most of us   most of us want more money  we re often hard wired to chase wealth and status https  thehappyorchardblog com the score cards that count in your life  it is rare to survey a millennial who would put strong caring relationships in their top goals for life    good relationships aren t sexy  being rich and famous is glamorous we think being able to buy whatever we want will make us healthy and happy it turns out investing in the quality of our relationships is a much better way to secure future health and happiness   but this is counter intuitive we get caught up in the rat race of life in the busyness careers eating well and exercising buying a bigger house relationships are often left by the wayside   working on relationships is not sexy or glamorous it s plain old hard work a slog i find myself sometimes thinking about other things i should be doing instead when spending time on relationships coffees with friends or long chats with families virtual or face to face leave the dishes not done or the bathroom not clean   it s also scary to reach out to strengthen relationships to open the door for others inviting people for tea making the first phone call or proposing the weekly catch up we open up to rejection to the door being slammed in our face   just know each instance i go out of my way to strengthen my relationships with my spouse friends and families i have felt better afterwards   sometimes it won t work out and sometimes the dishes will be left dirty but we now know that investing in our relationships is the single best way to impact our future health and happiness so turn tv time to family board game night plan a monthly date night or reach out to that friend for a zoom catch up you will feel better afterwards and you are protecting your heart and mind in the process

happy,Whysocomplicat3d,self.happy,2021-09-23 18:53:48,today was my last therapy appointment and i am so proud of myself and so thankful for my therapist   i ve already experience with therapy but during rona with no job university at home fearing my partner might get ill no seeing friends anymore no going out and so on depression and eating disorder came back i decided to get help in summer last year and first it got worse i really feard i might never get better   and now here i am a few month ago we changed to a two week schedule had a three week schedule a few times and it was completely fine i had a lot to talk about but rather about new exciting good stuff than therapy themes we even finished the last three appointments after only  minutes because there was just nothing to therapy anymore and it felt better and better   i had to use recovery records app for eating disorders where you log in every meal feeling and thoughts and your therapist can read it and since quite a while i felt rather annoyed about it and forgot a few times because it just didn t take up my mind anymore for the last month we went without it and i felt so free and happy and good again   she asked me if there were some things that got to less time or if i am afraid about certain things in the future and when i said i would liked to dig into my childhood a bit deeper she said but this is something you could do on your own too you re so strong and smart you ve learnt so much you re completely capable of dealing with this and this made me to proud and a bit teary eyed   i am truly happy and so thankful she is an awesome therapist and the first who really fully helped me i feel confident and strong and i am excited for the future   tl dr  today was my last therapy appointment and i am so happy i feel thankful and strong and ready for the future

happy,pudgieducky,self.happy,2021-01-21 03:31:11,i met my ocd match and have never been happier a feel good story  i  f met my partner  m at the restaurant we both work at when i met him i thought he was some random  year old kid who was our new dishwasher turned out to be a very young looking  year old man who would be joining our prep team i ve always had a thing for gingers we worked together everyday for a full year and i really liked how he operated he was so clean efficient and amazing at multi tasking this guy could crush a whole prep list in an hour or so while the kitchen area was spotless no dishes and a clean apron   there was this one time we went off in a rage of passion about how specific crunchies should he stored alphabetically use first on top refills underneath with all the tape labels facing the exact same way on messier chef wasn t putting them away properly and that was the exact moment i knew i had to have him i caught myself always staring at him as he went back to his station over the weeks and months we ended up closing together and we would walk from downtown towards his parents house and my apartment taking me to my door everytime i know he did it just to make sure i got home safe but i knew he loved it too   i started inviting him in to play mario games on my wicked gaming setup we spent the whole summer crushing services and playing video games until am most days everytime he would leave i would walk him down and he would say i can t believe how late we always end up hanging out and after a full year of making sure he was what i wanted i asked him out   he hadn t been with anyone for  years before me and was very anxious and vanilla but having to start from scratch didn t bother me on our first date while playing jenga at a bar some kids ran into the restaurant and threw lit firecrackers at the tables in the back we thought it was gunshots and the restaurant cleared out it was so scary and intense  long story short we got free takeout and went home to play video games i just remember feeling okay if that was the end and we were going to die i finally got to go out with him   another thing i really love about him is how passionate his is about proper recycling composting and purchasing things in bulk with jars i watched him today in the recycling bin aisle picking new bins he was in such deep thought about picking the right ones and kept bouncing ideas off me i just watched him in awe with big ol silly grin it made me giggle and feel warm inside   almost  year later we now live together in our very labeled apartment our favourite activities are putting away groceries and cleaning out the fridge together reorganizing things in our home and being the ultimate completion ists with our video games he finished mario odessy with   and it was super cute how excited he got when he beat the entire game and all it s moons   he fills my beside water makes my bed when i forget wipes down the calendar and starts the next month  am on the st of the month he fluffs the pillows on the couch wipes down the electronics and cares so much about how the bathroom looks and smells he gives so much of a fuck about himself manscapes all his areas to be well groomed gets haircuts on the dot every  weeks prebooks the next one when he s there and has an amazing bedtime skin routine   we never argue we communicate our wants desires and thoughts he problem solves quickly goes right to wendy s for exactly what i would order when i m pissy on my period and watching him make to do list and cross the entire thing off in a few days makes me wetter than the ocean   i never ask people to do things for me because  i want it done a very specific way and  i feel like an asshole trying to explain how and why i want it done that way which i can never explain because i want in done that way because i view it as the correct way in my mind and one day i realized i truthfully and genuinely trust this person if i give them a task or ask a favour he will  do it my way or  when i tell him i need it done certain way he doesn t argue and goes i understand that because he thinks the same way which makes me feel whole inside   my past relationships made me feel with my obsessive compulsive disorder i was unlovable that the way i liked things was unachievable and too high of a standard people would often compare me to monica from friends i like labels on the food in the fridge first in first out super clean windows i always cared about my entire house being setup as if surprise guests would be coming over  i felt like an asshole trying to get people to clean up better and to give more of a fuck i had come to terms with the fact i could date for fun but not for a long term serious relationship i was told no one would clean up at am after a board game night because they were too tired to do the dishes put the pieces in the correct boxes and reset the living room   until i met you   you made me feel like i wasn t alone   i love you   always yours   gm

happy,honest_scenario,self.happy,2021-03-13 21:21:59,my niece that i helped raise visited me for the first time since starting college  so long story short i helped raise my niece after her dad my older brother walked out on her and her mom when she was   i originally was hesitant about doing it because i was still grieving the loss of my wife years earlier something i still haven t fully moved on from of course me helping raise her were honestly the happiest years of my life i m confident in saying she s the daughter i never had and i m the dad she deserved and needed i was there for her at her lowest and highest and letting her go to start college was one of the hardest days in a long time but i knew she d be okay   we d been keeping in contact as regularly as possible texting a couple times a week and in her absence i got myself a dog to help with i guess my loneliness as sad as that sounds his name s bullet btw  he s a labrador retriever mix and one of his favorite things is hide and seek he s as trained as can be and rarely barks at other dogs or people when he s home alone and obviously coming home to him running up to me never fails to put a smile on my face   anyway my niece messaged me saying she had a long weekend due to having just finished midterm exams and was going to come over to my place to visit after she saw her mom first who also was equally there for her btw  so i m waiting and waiting and then i hear a car door close in my driveway i go out and no surprise it s her and the biggest smile imaginable comes across both of our faces as i walk over and we hug each other and it wasn t one of those hugs you give casually to your parents when you re going somewhere or when you see a good close friend this was one where we held each other tight long and didn t say anything and after i kissed the top of her head hard the first words i said were how s school been baby    and she laughs and we head inside the even bigger surprise was that she hadn t even gone to her mom s yet she came to see me first this just melted me i also brought my dog in from the backyard to see her and she immediately fell in love with him i remember he kept looking at me like who is this  and the more i stood next to her petting him the more comfortable he got   we then just sat and talked about school and how everything was going she s going for education and wants to teach k   basically she s made some new friends is in a club for her major and loves most of her classes   my life was obviously less exciting haha only really telling her i d been seeing other family members working from home more started doing some home renovations all that and i actually did manage to reconnect with someone i went to high school with and we met up for the first time a couple weeks ago   i also showed her something i never had before it was a photo of me and my wife at the hospital on the day of my niece s birth and i let her keep it rest of the day we spent with her mom and other family and went out to eat together watched a movie and other cool and exciting stuff i m planning on taking her shooting tomorrow one of her favorite pastimes just her being in my presence makes everything better i know that sounds vague but there aren t enough words for how much joy she brings me   just wanted to put this out there and express how i m feeling currently

happy,White_Notepad,self.happy,2021-03-13 10:12:51,as of today i m officially one year sober and i ll never forget what inspired me to quit in the first place i was basically a steady drinker in my late  s usually getting drunk at least a few times a week and starting off my morning with a beer or mimosa even if i was feeling fancy and the kicker i had a kid my six year old daughter and my wife who suffered through all of my bullshit i was a monster with a bottle in his hand never abusive or mean to them but quickly going down a health path i was sure i couldn t recover from   and one saturday morning i woke up with a hangover like nothing i had ever felt it was like someone had a sledgehammer and was beating me senseless over the head blurry vision hardly able to stand and i legitimately truly thought that the solution was to drink more so i poured myself a whiskey and threw it back and i remember feeling this very brief sense of huh i guess it passed before something from my stomach shot up to the top like a volcano and i was basically projectile vomiting all over the kitchen walls on the counter and in the sink   i remember that while my face was buried in the sink now i found the strength to stand up and collect myself a bit feeling a bit better and just looking around and seeing the volume of my destruction  wait  i did that  was immediately what went through my head but that vomiting wasn t what really made me want to change it was my daughter having to come out and see it yep she came out of her room and just stood there looking at me and all that vomit   and i remember the first thing she said was are you sick dad  and i reassured her that i was okay and that i just had an accident and politely told her to go back to her room for a little while while i cleaned up and she just nodded and walked away as soon as she closed her door i immediately burst into tears crying my eyes out on the floor the stink of my puke really starting to become more apparent   i eventually collected myself and scrubbed the whole area down like it was a crime scene that was the moment i decided to stop not my vomiting or me crying but seeing her standing there just staring in complete confusion and worry so i also threw out all the bottles and cans that day as well anything that wasn t hand sanitizer that contained alcohol was going in the bin and it stayed there   now it s a year later and if i m being honest i don t feel that different i mean i m glad i stopped drinking and that i have my family still with me but i don t feel any different from a personality perspective i m still the same sarcastic and upstanding guy i was before who also loves deadpan humor and can name you  of my favorite bands of all time nothing s changed yet everything has at the same time also

happy,FocusedMaintenance,self.happy,2021-03-12 18:46:14,my adopted daughter called for me for the first time ever a today and also clung on to me when she got scared after being shy around me since she moved in with us so quick summary me and my wife of four years wanted to start a family but my she cannot have kids of her own so after getting in touch with our local adoption agency and with them living with us for a few months with us as the foster parents we officially became the parents of two beautiful girls named amelia   and judy    they had been under the care of an actually very sweet and loving older couple who were their foster parents but obviously with them getting up there in age it was getting harder for them to take care of the girls so that s when we stepped in   now when i say she was standoffish i m referring to amelia she wasn t necessarily scared of me or my wife or anything like that in fact she was quite comfortable and adjusted very quickly to living with us she just saw me as a bit intimidating because i m rather tall    and have lots of tattoos i think she thinks i m like a biker or gangster or something lol and anytime i d ask her something like how school was it was usually just one word answers but whenever my wife would ask it d be hard to get her to stop talking this happened when we were the foster parents as well   so the incident in question happened earlier this afternoon my wife had taken judy to the mall to get some more stuff for school since they both may be going back to in person classroom attendance soon and i watched amelia we had breakfast together and she politely asked if she could go out in the backyard to play i was doing some work on my laptop in the kitchen and i hear my neighbor s dog a german shepherd barking and don t think much of it but then a few seconds later i hear her yell daddy for the first time ever i jog outside and see her standing there on the verge of tears as my neighbor s dog on the other side of the chain link fence is sitting there looking concerned   i go over and kneel down next to her asking what s wrong sweetie did he scare you  and all she does is nod and wrap her arms around me trying not to cry i smile and tell her it s okay sweetie he s not gonna hurt you and i pick her up and she s holding on to me with all her strength i immediately figure out what happened and know the dog isn t a threat because he is the biggest goofball you can imagine there was a ball next to the fence that amelia and her sister must have played with and the dog saw her and made the connection in his head that she wanted to play catch and was trying to get her attention to play i know this because he s done the same thing when i cut the grass or do yardwork and just wants someone to play with he s honestly the cutest thing  she calms down enough and while she s still holding on to me i get the dog to stand up and hold my hand out for him to sniff and lick my hand and say see he s not mean at all and i pet him all over his head and he melts in happiness i then ask her if she wants to try and she doesn t say anything except slowly reaches her hand forward and lets him smell her and she laughs as he licks her hand and she giggles and i kiss her on the cheek for good cuteness sake i even let her throw the ball and he quickly brings it back and dumps it in her hand and she s laughably grossed out and completely forgets why she was scared in the first place   eventually we both head back inside and i make her lunch and it s like an immediate transformation of how she is with me i just talk about the work i was doing and she s asking me loads of questions like she does my wife and it really just feels awesome just wanted to share this story and hope it made some of you smile

happy,shy_arcaneguy74,self.happy,2021-03-11 23:18:50,found my online friend after half a year of no communication with one another  i don t know if this belongs here but i but i m so happy to find my friend i lost a couple months back in late august early september   so today i was scrolling through the friendship subreddit on u needafriend when i came along a post of a teenager wanting to befriend others i was hooked into chatting with this one dude but as everyone does before sending a message to the person they re willing to talk to i first had to check the person s post history and the comment history to get a little more info on who this person is so as i was scrolling through his comment history i found this one post that sounded so familiar it said  name of friend  m and it was months back so i checked this one person s post history and they had a ton of posts about one specific topic they always talked about with me which was football and video games   after looking endlessly for this one friend through reddit by his username i somewhat remembered and trying every discord name related to his old tag i finally thought i found hope when coming across this profile it was new too i quickly messaged this person and asked him if his name was what he was called and he said yes i continued to tell him that i thought i knew him questioning him until i told him about who i was and if he remembered and he did telling me it was actually him this made me super happy after losing contact with him i knew him since june of last year and he was a great friend and now we re talking with one another on discord again and i m just so happy to finally hear from him again especially having the weights on my shoulders to finally be settled where i could explain to him why i disappeared out of the the blue and that he shouldn t worry about anything   the most unexpected things comes when you least know it so if there is something that you don t believe is going to work or you finally lost all hope it s all going to be alright in the end don t give up thanks fo reading i also wish you a great day or evening

happy,conifer13,self.happy,2020-05-23 22:10:19,big surprise and i can t stop smiling and occasionally screaming and dancing with happiness my student loan is paid in full and this is such a big deal way beyond the money  this happened yesterday i am still struggling to deal with it but in a very good way   i think i needed to share and it s not something for my rl networks   i checked my monthly pay that went into my bank account yesterday it was noticeably higher than normal which is odd because i m on a fixed salary get no overtime or allowances and any pay increases only happen in august i went online to check my pay slip and there it was  no student loan deduction made i only get a sl statement once a year and it s been a while since the last but at that point i d calculated my repayments would finish at the end of this year so this was right out of the blue i checked with payroll department and yes they have received notice on st of the month to stop taking payments   well this is amazing news for anyone of course and the extra money is going to be fantastic  or will be when lockdown ends and i can get out and use it not that i m ungrateful for being safe and still able to work   but for me this is so much more   i have had a very difficult relationship with all things relating to my university experience right from when i applied  i d wanted to take a year out before going parents wouldn t let me i then wasnt accepted for any of my applications and this was on the back of me being top of every class at school with tons of extra curricular and volunteer work and everything else you could possibly want  i ended up having to take a year off so i could reapply but it was too late to be able to do my original plans so i just got a job and watched all my friends leave town plus i had to endure my dad not speaking to me for  months solid while i was still living with my parents  huge mess   second time round i got into a world renowned university   but halfway through my studies i had a complete mental breakdown  nvm why ptsd suicide attempts very bad stuff eventually i dropped out because of it my parents reaction to this was so severe that i couldn t possibly move home had to cut off contact for a while in fact because of the toll it was taking on me dealing with their destructive and controlling and demeaning behaviour   this was also just as the credit crunch happened and there i was with no degree no confidence or support a suddenly very restricted and competitive job market trying desperately to keep a roof over my head because to go home would have literally killed me i racked up credit card debt just to pay the basic bills i had no social life and lost all my friends i had to live in a hostel for a while and in many squalid and dodgy places after that too trying to explain dropping out of a very prestigious university to potential employers was impossible as was trying to deal with my mental health and financial problems had to take the first job i could get and spent the next  years or so trapped in an awful attempt at a career i hated and that made me die inside every day   i honestly don t know how i got through it   and all the while the interest was piling up on this  figure sum of sl debt   for which i had absolutely nothing to show every year i d get a statement showing that the interest accrued was more than what i d repaid so the debt kept growing and i honestly thought i would never be free of it until i die   i was so trapped by all of this for such a long time doing soul destroying work because i had no other choice for nightmare bosses living in squalor trying to deal with debt and mental health problems having no support network so many times i came close to ending it   oh and another real kicker was when i eventually decided to go back to finish my degree to try and break out of this cycle but because of the funding rules i could not get a further student loan to do so and would have to pay  k per year tuition fees upfront from my own pocket plus living expenses not possible   dark days dark years in fact but bit by bit it eventually got better   through very frugal living i managed to balance my budget it meant no social life for years and that has done lasting damage to the relationships of my youth destroyed most of them in fact but i paid down my credit cards and eventually started to save   what took longer was building up my confidence and finding better work i still don t exactly love what i do but there is at least meaning to it and variety and challenge and that s good enough plus through hard work and a fair dose of good luck i have managed to become moderately successful i lead a team although i still so often feel like an imposter i m surrounded by people not just with degrees but extensive postgrad study doctorates etc i even manage some of them to be in my position without a degree is very unusual but however difficult and not me the work may sometimes be it is at least work i can take pride in   it s perhaps ironic that i now work at a university and even now there are days when that is in itself very hard because i see so much of where my life could maybe have gone instead   so for all these years  about  of them  i ve had this sl debt hanging over me reminding me what a waste it was always pulling me back to all the things i went through because of that failed attempt at study   and now  bam with one glance at my monthly pay it s all gone the debt is gone the last tangible link to all that horrible history is gone the fact that it was a surprise has made the impact even deeper   i m suddenly free of so much more than the financial debt and i can t stop going nuts over it   bottle of bubbly has been popped     tl dr unexpected end of student loan repayments has me high as a kite feeling free of so much bad history

happy,Midiex,self.happy,2018-12-10 17:49:54,after a difficult year i want to recognize mrs wanda  a retail store employee who went above and beyond her job duties to show me the true spirit of christmas  story and photo inside  my four year old daughter has been begging santa to bring her one of those lol surprise egg things that apparently is one of the it toys this christmas  i have been out of state for two months and missing my little girl like crazy  fortunately i will be surprising my little one with my return on christmas morning   and bringing her a big lol surprise thingamajig thanks to the kindness of mrs wanda at walmart   i really needed to find one of the toys for cheap because i ve been unemployed since june  a few weeks ago i read that a specific one  a big one   was on clearance at walmart for   down from something like     originally  last sunday i searched six different walmart stores for it but i had zero luck  i was bummed out but would have to settle for a smaller one that had a few surprises in it   early last week and just a couple of days after my search i called a local walmart and asked to speak with someone in toys i figured it wouldn t amount to anything but couldn t hurt to ask someone in the toy section i really wanted to give my daughter the biggest toy i could afford since i haven t seen her in so long i have called a walmart before and getting in touch with someone in a specific department is about as easy as calling a radio station to win concert tickets people might not do that anymore but i m old  to my surprise  someone actually answered my call  i told them i was looking for a toy that was on clearance and that it was a long shot then before i could say anything else the lady asked if i had seen it on the walmart site and asked if i would text her the sku number and a picture of the item so she could look for it  i was shocked  it was impressive she was willing to look around for me during the busiest time of the year and it was especially impressive  that she was willing to get her personal cell phone involved being that i was a random customer so i texted her a picture of the toy along with the sku figuring i d get a call five minutes later saying she couldn t find it  an hour passed and she called me back to say she had combed the toy department and the stock room  even asking her manager for help  but could not find it  i wasn t surprised she didn t see one but i was incredibly impressed that she made such an effort to help me   here s the kicker    last night i while i was browsing reddit i received a call from a local phone number i didn t recognize and i answered it    hey this is wanda from walmart    in that moment i was not even thinking about the phone call i had made early last week  mrs wanda went on to say she had been in the back of the store looking for an item for a customer apparently she is awesome to everyone when she ran across a box that had a mysterious lol surprise toy that looked like the one in the picture i sent  she took the item to a register and checked the price and when it rang up as   she looked through her phone to find our text exchange and called me to see if i still wanted it  i was really in shock  i told her i d be there in  minutes if she could hold it for me    i ll be wearing it like a purse  i ll make sure no one else takes it    i immediately hopped in my car and drove like a mad man to the crowded walmart bolting to the toy section as quickly as i have ever moved through a retail store  there was a group of people huddled up thanking someone profusely for their help and as they departed i saw a walmart employee standing there  with a big lol surprise toy hanging from her arm like a purse   my first words in the moment were  mrs wanda  i need a hug  and i pointed to the toy on her arm  she flashed me the biggest smile and gave me a hug like we were old friends  i told her she had no idea what she had just done for me and that she was making me the father of the year  i asked her if she would take a picture with me then i started getting emotional  a grown man holding a big lol surprise  standing next to the bicycles and crying  she told me to stop crying or she would start and i quickly got her information so i could tell someone the story of what she did for me     here is the picture of mrs wanda and

happy,poppyfield_76,self.happy,2019-08-11 01:19:47,i ve hit seven months without a single panic attack or case of long lasting anxiety  note sorry this is an extremely long post but it goes through when i started getting panic attacks and through my recovery also sorry in advance for any typos and my bad grammar  i m using a g board and also my english is pretty bad   last year for about half a year or so i had really bad anxiety   when it first started i didn t understand what was happening to me all i knew was that i felt weird and it was a bad kind of weird it frustrated me to not understand what i was feeling just that i felt strangely off sometimes and it felt like it was on a health level and i didn t like it i don t know what i realized first that when this happens my heart was beating instantly fast or that the emotion i was feeling felt close to fear    it went on like that for weeks maybe even a month  during that month it got worse and worse and i realized something really wasn t right and i wasn t just overreacting it became hard to breathe during those episodes it would usually be promoted by or prompt overthinking and i felt like i wasn t really in my body i constantly feel afraid for no reason and i noticed i started to spend more time frowning than i did smiling  a lot more time   then it got even worse i began having these episodes when i showered at first it was once every three or so days then every two days then every day  i would classify them as episodes at the time because i just couldn t explain it and these episodes were way worse in the shower and i feel like that was because there was no one around to watch it happen i would start to lose my breath find it hard to breathe feel my heart pounding feel so scared feel like i wasn t even in my body i felt so detached so alone and i would cry so hard i would almost throw up all i would feel like doing is sitting down on the shower floor and curling up into a ball this got so bad i dreaded showers absolutely dreaded   that continued for months and months at a certain point probably two months in i realized that those episodes were panic attacks and i had death anxiety being an over thinker and an atheist i ve never had a way to grasp the idea of what happens after we die because i believed nothing would happen i was embarrassed that s all i felt for a long time because i thought it was the dumbest thing to have anxiety because of a fear i hated myself for being that way and i was so frustrated with myself   it was probably around  months in when a i finally began to talk to someone about it my online friend i ve had for many years i knew she has had terrible stress and anxiety issues in the past and i needed answers to my questions about anxiety problems as well as an ear to let it all out plus i m still a minor so i live with my parents and i love and appreciate my parents but i ve never liked being emotional especially with my family so i ve always dreaded talking about these things with my parents and kept it a secret  i just wasn t ready to tell them during the shower i took later on that day i didn t have an episode it really helped and over the course of two months the frequency of my panic attacks slowly faded away   i still remember the time i cried at school during my recovery i wasn t sad i was happy i was walking back from lunch to my classroom building we have to walk outside to go between the two buildings about a quarter mile apart all alone since i forgot my backpack at lunch so my teacher let me go grab it and i remember i was smiling and i noticed i was smiling and that i felt so content halfway in and that meant the amount of progress i was going through was astonishing i hadn t smiled of felt happy in the past few months at that point and all i ve felt was fear or sadness it made me so happy i cried all my way back to the building   i started talking to a camp friend about my anxiety after that as well and from there it was all uphill that smile gave me so much motivation it was such a nice reward  never had i been more grateful to be able to genuinely smile it took time and my spring sports season also really helped with my recovery but i eventually made it once i was crying myself to sleep daily and relying on rescue pastilles to go through the school day and now i m crying tears of joy at the thought of my recovery and enjoying every second of my life it s been seven whole months since my last panic attack and i couldn t be happier about whether i m at in life right now   long story short i had anxiety and terrible panic attacks for months and spent months trying to get better it s been seven months since my full recovery and last panic attack and i m extremely glad about it i m so grateful for where i m at now and i couldn t be happier   for people experiencing the same or similar things please please please talk to someone about it if you don t feel comfortable telling your friends yet you are always welcome to talk to me talking was what got me to where i m at and believe me when i say that it helps a lot more than you can imagine i went from feeling at my worst to my best in just a few months because i talked about it and the two friends i talked about it to i don t see regularly because one is from summer camp schools and the other is an online friend please also find what works for you for me exercise really helped easy my stress and anxiety levels and it seems to be the case for most people

happy,Biljon,self.happy,2019-01-08 20:15:32,i m dating the love of my life  i have anger issues i bottle my feelings up inside and then when something finally sets me off i explode i believe these issues started when i was a kid my dad was in prison from the time i was six years old all the way up until i was   my mom was embarrassed by this and told me not to tell any of the other kids if anyone were to ask where my dad was i was supposed to say he was on a business trip my mom used to cry all the time when my dad was in prison so i saw it as my responsibility to be strong  so despite my sadness i didn t cry once during the  years my dad was in prison i believe this is where i learned to bottle  i don t blame my mom nor do i view this story as an excuse for my anger issues anyways  let s get to the happy part    years ago i met the love of my life she s beautiful kind and as compassionate as could be but most importantly i trust her completely surprisingly enough we met through tinder our first date was to a comedy show on the drive back to her house she asked about my childhood at this point i don t think either of us thought the date was going particularly well and i didn t expect to see her again so i told her everything  stuff i still haven t told some of my oldest friends she listened to me and even shared some stuff about herself neither of us had the greatest childhoods growing up but after talking to her and listening to what she had to say i knew she was someone i wanted to be friends with which is why i was very sad when i found out she was going to a school  hours away from me i had finally found someone i could trust but they were moving away    she invited me to her going away party after a few minutes there i realized i was the odd one out everyone else there she had known for years family old childhood friends and me but not once did i feel out of place we had a fun night of playing board games and talking when i left i hugged her and she said  i have something for you  and ran to her room and came back with a cd she had burned for me for the next couple of months that cd was all that i listened to   even though we had just met a couple weeks before she went away to school i visited her every weekend the more time i spent with her the more i grew to like her and eventually i fell in love with her since our first date didn t really end up romantically i asked her if she d be interested in going on a second first date and she said yes i was so happy   and this happiness continues to this day it feels so nice to have someone in my life that i can trust and help me to work through my anger issues i m happy to say i m a much less angry person than i was  years ago thanks to my gf s understanding and constructive criticism i feel much more in control of my emotions and i feel like i m able to articulate how i m feeling to her in a clear and calm manner i have made some serious effort to have a good relationship with myself so that i can have a good relationship with her and i am all the happier for it

happy,smolprincess928,self.happy,2019-01-08 13:30:13,i feel included for the first time in a long time hey all first time poster this is such a strange strain of happiness and i wanted to share    generally when i meet people in a place where they re forced to spend time with me i e grade school summer camp college classes etc  they generally seem to enjoy my company i like to think i m a kind person though i will admit i can be a little overwhelming with how much i try and take care of people and make sure everyone is happy and healthy i m generally seen as the mom of friend groups so these people like me until we hang out on our own outside of this forced interaction as soon as we go out on our own they apparently decide that they ve made a mistake and i never hear back from them again it s been that way my entire life so i m used to it albeit extremely disheartened because of this and other health issues i ve been completely isolating myself over the past year however an acquaintance from high school reached out last weekend and asked if i wanted to hang out i agreed and had a wonderful time meeting some new people as well as the softest gray cat ever a super fluff tuxedo kitty and a lovely but deaf as shit australian cattle dog i left after a few rounds of mario party and prepared myself for regulation disappointment but but they reached out to me again today and invited me to watch hereditary with them and their friends they re all getting together to watch a movie and they thought of me i actually might cry    i just want people to know that if you feel like you re alone and that there s no one out there for you to lean on or talk to that s not the case there s always people that care if you re having trouble finding them or just want to talk my inbox is always open no one is alone

happy,sinfulthia,self.happy,2019-08-22 02:03:11,a new start has turned my life around   happy days are ahead with a successful road i feel it sit back and watch me as i continue to strive and grow and be the best mom and person i can be  hello i have only learned about reddit about  week ago and i love it i think it is a great way of having people who trully care about what is going on in a persons life i m surrounded by friends and family everyday and still have no one i can talk to now thanks to reddit and all of you i have people that i can talk to that i feel whole heartedly care and will give the best advice without judgeing me or my decisions   a little history about me is at age  i was anancipated and deemed a legal adult i grew up in a house of drugs all around me so i fought my mother in court and i won at  i became a legal adult and i went to my freshman year of highschool and maintained a full time time and was the only one in school with my own apartment it was great at  i took my mom back to court to get custody of my  year old brother and won so now i had a full time job full time student full time mother of a  year old and maintained a household paying bills and grocery shopping everything that a mother has the responsibility of doing my little brother today is an amazing person he is married now with  kids of his own and is the general manager at jack in the box i am so proud of him   well at the age  one month away from graduating high school i met my kids father and we started partying and doing drugs i did not finish my senior year and dropped out my whole world was wrapped around this new boy in my life and before i knew it my life was nothing but drugs and him at the age of  i had my first child and my mother was at this point using drugs with me and we lived together again my brother moved out and married at  so it was me and my man and my mom and a few other family members living helping to support each other s habbits getting pregnant slowed me down but after my son was born i just went right back to the drugs at the age of  i was pregnant with my daughter and i slowed down but only while i was pregnant   now when i turned  my mom was with my kids me and their dad split up and i never went home anymore just bounced from place to place using my body to earn money for my drugs my kids only saw me on their birthdays and holidays the very woman i took her son to raise as my own was now raising my  and my mom has her faults but i love her more than she will ever know for keeping my babies healthy and happy and being there when i was not i was  when i woke up one morning and told my self no more i went home i went back to school   now i m  years old for the first time i have my own  bedroom home with my two children i live everyday for them i m sober stopped using cold turkey never have been to any meeting or any rehabs i was just done and put the drugs down and walked away in a moment s time i now have my high school completion where i graduated with a   gpa i continued in school and received my associates degree in medical billing and coding and was honored by being my class valid victorian with a   gpa and am currently working towards receiving my bachelor s degree in healthcare information management and specializing in nursing home facility management still maintaining a      i was homeless with both my kids for  year and  months we lived in a tent in the desert cps was called on me  times in that year and a half but i never lost my kids i just continued to do what i needed to do to continue to move forward in this past december i learned of a homeless program called jewish family services and i went to them and told them my situation and let them know i a was in the desert in a tent with my two children in about  days i got my key to my very own  bedroom house and my rent is only    a month and this includes all my utilities my kids and i are at this moment closer and happier than ever and my life is turned around i have learned through all this that it is never to late to get your life back my kids are now  years and  years with many many issues that i gave my daughter abandonment issues she would get anxiety attacks daily scared to leave my side that i would not return my son was a problem in school refused to participate got suspended constantly if he even went to class i had to constantly stop and remember this was my fault my actions and my choice to never be there for them gave my kids behavorial problems i did not know how to handle gave my little girl issues that made her feel like she was not good enough to be loved  i faced it everyday and it was heart breaking and very very hard to get through   today my son is an honor roll student my daughter sleeps in her own bed with no fear and i am about to start a new career   drugs is no longer a daily fight for me and my life is better than ever i never thought as a teenage adult i would walk down the same path as my mom but i did it  times harder and selfishly than she ever did drugs are a sickness like nobodies business but i am proof that there is life after addiction strong minded and determination was the  key things i kept on my side  i m so thankful everyday for the second chance i was givin it s never to late to get your life back   thanks for listening to my story of my life

happy,Beethovensnothere,self.happy,2019-09-19 15:51:02,i ve been struggling with my mental health for years and i finally addressed it with medication and a bit of love for myself today i realised it is getting better  i have battled with my mental health for  years at times i have self harmed attempted suicide and yet i have never actually consistently taken medication   this is part stubbornness and part not feeling like i m worthy enough to look after myself  i developed ptsd after a traumatic event  years ago and around  years ago i had emdr treatment and my symptoms massively reduced but i still had all the residual anxiety compulsions and self doubt left over that began in my teens i just endured this but it would always spiral when life got hard   after working hard to get a job i love supporting other people my mental health began to spiral after a relationship broke down i began having panic attacks i wasn t eating or sleeping and i felt so terribly about myself i couldn t stop thinking destructive thoughts i realised if i wanted to support people i needed to put myself first   i went back to the gym and rode that endorphin wave i stopped eating rubbish food i reconnected with friends who i love but have neglected i made a pact with myself not to enter into another relationship until i am happier and have gotten over the previous one i made tangible plans to move out on my own with my cat i get the keys  weeks tomorrow i also bought a lot of plants i began journalling and researching how to think about myself in a more positive way   i went to the gp and was prescribed sertraline and vowed to actually take it today i came across something that i know just two weeks ago would have made me spiral  but i didn t i felt a knock but i was able to calm myself down and recover i feel like i am thinking rationally about set backs and not taking them personally   my appetite is back i have more emotional energy and i feel much much more calm my sleeping isn t there but you can t have it all at once i know there ll still be dips but i am so happy and feel like i m on the up finally i feel happy more than i feel awful   it is never too late to get help and no problem is ever too small to be addressed if you are wondering if the pain you feel on a day to day basis should just be put up with  it shouldn t there is no shame in getting help and i wish i could go back to  year old me and put her in treatment so i didn t have to feel so awful

happy,findmylifecoach,self.happy,2019-09-19 14:06:31,free life coaching confidence and happiness tip     confidence tip   don t take yourself so seriously     it s easy to get tripped up because we are overly self conscious we think people are scrutinizing how we look judging what we say or do or perceive us a certain way the truth of it is most people are so self absorbed they re likely focusing much more on how they look what they say or do and how they appear to an extent it is just human nature there may be some people who because they have their own issues are judgmental of others but that is their baggage as a wise woman once told me repeatedly until the message sunk in  what other people think of you is none of your business  mind your own business  and carry on      have a great weekend

happy,kunmeh13,self.happy,2019-09-08 15:35:50,a realization i ve made about staying happy i was watching a joe rogan clip on youtube i wish i could find it about happiness and what he said really really resonated with me i ll try my best to remember recreate what he had said   he used an example of two kids the first one was given a lamborghini in high school and at the time kid  was probably the happiest teenager alive but when the kid goes off to college the lambo has to be sold and replaced with a new bmw it s still a whole ass bmw but kid  is kinda bummed as he had a lambo in high school   kid  instead is given a   honda civic through high school was still happy but maybe not as happy as kid   but then kid  is given the same new bmw in college kid  is really excited as he just upgraded from his civic to a new bmw   both kids are at the exact same point in their life in college with a bmw yet kid  is much happier than   you d be mistaken if you think they should be equally happy since we find our happiness in comparison whether it s with what we used to have or what others have   this completely shook me and it related to where i m currently at too i recently moved to a university in a new state after living in the same town for  years leaving behind everything i ve ever known i was about to go to a large state school where i would ve been with my long term girlfriend and would have already had a group of friends i love trying new things but i wasn t ready for literally everything to be new nonetheless i chose the out of state school for its superior program in the field i m studying i left behind my best friends and what s given me more trouble my long term girlfriend this girl was gorgeous caring and legitimately everything i could ve asked for but we chose to go our own ways and break up since we were attending different universities   but in these first few weeks i ve met such an incredible group of people and i really should have no reason to be sad if i was a social outcast in high school i would be the happiest person alive right now with just the friends i have now but since i m looking back at what i had and what it could be i m being unreasonably bogged down   just making this realization has really helped me and my message to all of you is to not let best be the enemy of better

happy,FuriouslyBlazingLion,self.happy,2019-09-08 10:19:15,after being made to feel like a constant failure in my past relationships my fiance just yesterday encouraged me sign up for the course i dropped out of  years ago a lot of back story tw idk  oh and tldr at the end if you don t want to read my life story lmaooo  please be kind this is difficult to talk about but i share as part of recovery ptsd and in the hope of trying to help some else realise they can defeat their demons if they keep fighting hard enough for long enough   i had a really rough childhood was abused an neglected this encouraged me to get into bad relationships when i was  i had nothing to life far so depressed smoking pot all the time i decided having a baby might give me more purpose someone who really loved me and force me to get back on track  i know what a cliche   the guy i had my child with was is a terrible man and hasn t been in our lives since my son was about mo he constantly broke me down abused me and made me feel like less than the dirt on his shoe then he did something utterly unforgivable to me and after a couple months of getting my bravery i kicked him out     and on the rebound from a traumatic relationship i fell straight into the arms of another abuser this one was different though to start with he was so sweet he had a hard time lately too so i wanted to help him he knew this and he preyed on this i was in a very bad place and wanted an open relationship as an excuse to self destruct through impulsive sexual behavior and excessive alcohol consumption he used this against me instead of helping me understand why i was doing what i was doing he abused me to the point where i no longer wanted to live he was is a drug addict and i fell into heavy pot smoking during this time too i threw him out more times than i can count but he always wormed his way back in i finally decided i had to leave if i wanted any peace for me and my son so i left i was   he was  if memory serves   i lived with my mother for a short time as i had nowhere else to go she is a drug addict but i never realised the depths of her mental instability until i moved back in with her she berated me constantly made me feel like a terrible mother for falling apart and not functioning she d agree to look after my son and promise she wouldn t be getting high but then would and would abuse me for leaving my son with her like i forced her to do it she tried to beat me on at least two occasions it wasn t safe for us there and i was desperate to get out   a friend said i could stay with her but this invitation only lasted a week and i was homeless with my son in emergency accommodation at a motel i couldn t handle my life anymore i had to get out or i d never survive so i left i got someone who i thought was a friend met online to come over from another state and take me to somewhere where i could have a fresh start  or so i thought    we ended up living in a house he was actually a flatmate in it was his friend s mother s house and he paid a bit of rent he promised me he d help me find a house and help me get back on my feet bit all he wanted from me is what most people would think he d expect in return for rescuing a damsel in distress and i gave it to him because i felt i had no other choice but that or homelessness on the streets of a big city where i knew nobody and winter was around the corner   the friend i had lived with for a week in my hometown had moved to the same city in this time and she told me to come live with her i did and it was stressful she had two young kids and i had my one living with her lasted about six weeks before she told me i had to leave right before easter i convinced her to let me stay until just after so the homeless support services would be more operational   i found myself in another motel homeless and scared   i had spoken about what was happening with another newly made online friend talk for maybe a month and he told me he lived three hours away but as luck would have it him and two of his daughters were at a friends place just around the corner from my motel i was shit scared for good reason but i agreed to meet up an go for dinner together with one of his daughters i felt so at ease and comfortable   we went back to where he lived after a few days of hanging out and we lived with him until we got a place of our own me and him had a weird friendship and after a few big ups an downs and him helping me work through some intense stuff we got together   it s now been almost two years since we got together and he s the best thing to ever happen to me he s held my pieces together while i ve set them with glue and together we are both healing from our sorted pasts and helping heal our children too we are both in such an amazing place now from such tough times in our pasts through being so loved and comfortable a lot of my forgotten trauma has decided to try and run the show and wreck havoc on my mental state but he has been there every step every tear and every panic attack of the way he is my inspiration to keep going and my rock in the storm    yesterday he convinced me that i m good enough and talented enough to get back into the beauty course i dropped out of years ago they start taking enrollments in october but today i finally got the balls up to send in an enquiry for an info pack and for information on how to transfer my previous completed modules of work if i can enrol i ll be starting i m february and i ll be one step closer to reaching my dream of starting my own business one day   our next steps are working towards me being brave enough to call my maternal grandparents who my mother convinced me were evil my whole life surprise they aren t  getting a new car new place and both of us getting healthy so we can be here for a long ass time for our kids and to enjoy our best life together   i ve made mistakes i ve been treated badly here i am fighting on trying my hardest some days are worse than others but i have the best man in the world and an amazing psychologist i m so proud of myself and how much i ve turned my life around it s been so hard but do worth it i know who i am i m a good mother i m a good person    if i can do it you can do it no matter how hard your life is how much the chips are stacked against you there is always a way through a way forward you can be the person you always hoped to be just choose choose to get up and see what you can do rather than what you can t choose to try and find the good in every moment know who you are and fight for what is right i believe in you    tldr had a bad life lots of mistakes and bad treatment life is now everything i ve wanted and more you can do it too be brave and seize

happy,ulj1Ivh,self.happy,2019-04-12 23:55:18,i set a boundary  i recently visited someone who i thought could be a possible friend i m very isolated and alone i m working on it and my current challenge is that i tend to stick around longer with certain individuals most people would definitely leave after being around very shortly i wrongly think i m the one who has to suck it up  regardless of their lack of interest in me their bad habits rudeness invalidation and putting down or unhealthiness as a result i have unspeakable rage  that i try very hard to but rarely channel into healthy assertive action but this person was pretty supportive and thoughtful in a past specific environment so i agreed to meet them after a couple years well they changed   the hangout was pretty bad    can skip if don t wan t details    gt most times when i tried to speak they replied with a completely different topic one about themselves in long stories without stopping much for me to join in and the only times i could even make a sound was when the person stopped to drink or look at their phone i d often begin to speak but they d bulldoze through without hearing me i often very audibly asked happy lighthearted questions to propel balanced conversations and they often didn t even respond like literal silence after being asked a conversational question sometimes while looking at their phone sometimes acting as if they didn t even hear me and trust me i was within  feet of them the whole time and every place we walked or sat was quiet   gt   gt later they started asking me a lot of way too personal questions involving finance where i get my money and word for word said  do you use your mom s credit card for everything  later the person kept repeating over and over that we should start a creative business together  mentioning they don t know how to use a computer do art or create anything but they know how to do everything else  then they kept saying i should either move to their place and help them clean their apartment and work on everything portfolios job entire life together they kept mentioning they could move to my place as well kept saying we don t have to but you should sleep over at my place i could sleep over at yours sometimes we could hang out for a whole two days    gt   gt btw we re the same gender this is not a date and this is the first time we saw each other in  years   gt   gt and i said ok to everything as the person blurted everything out so fast in the end  i told thanked them for hanging out with me we both expressed we d meet again   amp x  b   i felt like utter empty cowardly disrespected shit   all those inner pep talks to say no on the spot were blown   but yesterday i decided to put my foot down instead of letting go with ambiguous silence i tried something new   i utilized my anger and gave them a piece of my mind by texting them exactly how they were inappropriate explained how i felt told them i am moving on for me said i m just letting them know this so they know what happened between us and then i wished them well i set up online and offline boundaries and they cannot contact me again   it s true that i could ve not done anything and nope d out   but i need to start somewhere this would be the starter for getting used to speaking up on the spot which is my ultimate goal   if i think in my deathbed of the times i stood up for myself at least i have one so far

happy,fefifofumm,self.happy,2019-03-23 21:58:55,after a rough couple years it s nice having someone i connect with who is kind to me because he wants to be  i had a really bad last few years my year relationship ended  of my friends died  of my family members died my mom got scleroderma which has since spread to her lungs and digestive track i got too busy with school and work to maintain my sports and i got into a year long relationship with a horrifically manipulative older man   i finally got a new place it s a little expensive for my grad school budget but it feels like home and makes me happy i reconnected with girl friends i lost touch with when i was in my isolating relationship and they genuinely seem to want to have me around   i also started seeing a guy he s kind and didn t mind waiting for me to be ready to have sex last week i had a low moment where i got bad work news and wanted to leave the guys place i feel like most people in my life don t care to hear about my problems so i never open up this guy gave me a hug and told me that he wants me to stay and talk to him about what s wrong but i can leave if i d like and we could talk later it was so genuine and soft no demands no annoyance no preaching solutions just a light offer to listen   yesterday i cooked him dinner and we got really drunk together and finally became physical it was one of the best intimate experience i ve ever had but i woke up with a horrific hangover he held my hair while i was sick brought me paper towels and water cooked me breakfast and made me coffee before i had to leave for work i m busy studying right now and he is picking me up some chipotle and bringing it over for a dinner study break date   my ex would always do these big grand and expensive gestures and would use those as excuses when he would cheat or lie to me this guy is so light and casual with his actions but they are so thoughtful and so meaningful   i m sure we ll run into conflicts and maybe we won t last but right now having someone do something like bring me a burrito while i m studying has made me feel so cared for and happy i don t even think he realized what the gesture means to me to him it s just a casual thing he s offering somehow that makes it even better

happy,Valoissa,self.happy,2019-05-10 23:27:51,a nice tribute to my grandmother long read  i am here to share something that my sister and i created i will start out with a brief backstory   please understand that this is not to be taken as a sad story at any point as you will see if you read on  everything worked out as well as possible and my grandmother was prepared to move on to the next step of her journey    so a little about my grandmother   my grandmother on my fathers side had always been known for her traditional pennsylvania dutch cooking and absolutely amazing recipes   she had fallen ill a few months ago and moved up to a local nursing home which she had worked at for over  years   our immediate family and many of her friends made sure we visited her very often   on the  th of april my grandfather my father my sister and myself were up for a visit my grandmother was very tired but she was able to briefly say hello to us in the late afternoon hours she told my grandfather she was ready to go  later that day in the early evening we saw the signs that she was she preparing to pass we were all there for her and we were with her supporting her   my grandfather went to her bed sat next to her and held her hand as she left   she had chosen not to have a traditional service and to simply be cremated but shall be honored tomorrow by a small amount of family and friends   so we decided to do something a little different to show our respects and further preserve her legacy  instead of handing out a memorial paper we made a tribute to her in the form of a cookbook featuring some of her most popular recipes   to do this i borrowed her large collection of recipes from my grandfather  i then made high resolution scans of the family favorites and uploaded them to my sister s dropbox account   i also scanned several photos of my grandmother and some with her and my grandfather throughout the years and sent them to my sister to edit as well   my sister then edited the notecard scans to be printed into a small cookbook and used a photo of the wallpaper from my grandmother s kitchen as the background for the pages   my sister placed a dedication message and arranged the recipes by types main courses soups desserts genera knowledge   so we ve finished scanning and editing right but now where to have it printed and bound properly    my sister found a store to do exactly that   i will not name the exact store because they did something very nice for us and just incase i don t want to get any employees in trouble for being good people   when she brought the prepared files to the store and explained the plans we were given a price quote and estimated time for completion   as it came time to finalize the print we were u fortunately told that the quote would be roughly double the cost we decided we would simply make a tiny number of copies and give them to just a few immediate family members   however the employees were very much moved by our project and took matters into their own hands    the prints originally had a blank white border due to the printer not being able to fully cover the pages an employee hand cut the border off she also took it upon herself to offer a massive discount and provided  free extras which absolutely made sure that everyone who is intended to have a copy will be able to do so   thanks for reading i hope to inspire others to do something like this our family who knows of this project is nothing short of thrilled and i know that tomorrow this will help make a lot of people happy   if you have similar stories please share  i ll make sure to check back on here incase anyone reads this   have a good weekend everyone stay positive

happy,ExecutiveElf,self.happy,2019-07-06 01:22:38,i made an unexpected fuzzy little friend while celebrating the th of july a day late  i live in a small town with a population of around   people tonight the fire department was doing a fireworks display because it was raining last night  my mother sister and i were about to head over to where they were being set off when i spotted a stray kitten i tried to get it to approach me in order to not frighten it but it ran of when my mother started the car i decided at the time that it would probably go back to its presumably ally cat mother   about  minutes later we returned at first i didn t see anything but when i opened the car door to get out i heard i little meow i then spotted the kitten hiding underneath a truck parked across the street this time i was able to get it to approach me after it calmed down i went and got it a bowl of water i would have fed it too but it looked maybe a month old and while i m not certain i think that is too young for meat  also at this point my sister named her callie   my mother eventually went inside after about  minutes followed by my sister about  minutes later but i stayed outside still afraid to pick her up because a i didn t know how she would react and b ultimately she was an ally cat getting bit would be really bad especially considering that i m allergic to cats anyway after about  minutes of waiting the fire trucks that were at the fireworks display were getting back to the station which is actually across the street from my house so i then finally picked up callie and held her in my shirt to make sure she couldn t hurt either of us and walked over to the fire department to ask if they could help me out they said they couldn t and to call the humane society well the problem with that is that it was now  pm so then i went back home and sat down with callie   i was getting ready to leave her briefly to make sure my dogs were already in bedrooms for the night so that i could take her inside when i heard a women s voice behind me she said that the firemen told her about my problem she then went on to say that she lives on a farm a few miles away and has  other cats and offered to take callie   i am just so happy that it worked out despite it being  pm in such a small town that i needed to find this sub   also sorry for the lack of a picture i was more concerned making sure callie didn t wander off or get herself hurt than with taking pictures

happy,TriggerHippie77,self.happy,2019-07-18 11:52:47,meet max power i saved his life and he saved mine and for that i am happy  https  i imgur com pk j n jpg  https  i imgur com aqtrrto jpg  max power came into our lives over  years ago he s been with us through the thick and thin we have three other dogs two other shi tzus and a samoyed and max has taken the alpha male role around the house he s got a system and when he s not feeling well we all feel it   last february max stopped eating regularly and started losing weight he was slowly declining and fading away after several trips to the vet we were told it was the beginning stages of kidney failure but it could be treated he did fine with the kidney treatments but by this point he stopped eating entirely he acted like he wanted to eat but just couldn t   so i started syringe feeding him at this point to keep him going until we could figure out what was going on finally we were able to get him to an ultrasound and found the problem pyloric stenosis a condition where the pyloris thickens and creates a situation where food can not be ejected from the stomach into the colon so he essentially always felt full   we decided despite his age we wanted to take the chance on surgery we know him and we know he wants to fight so we have him that opportunity surgery was on a wednesday last april and even though he seemed better friday he began a serious decline that weekend he still had no interest in eating or drinking he was fighting his syringe feedings and even worse he was vommitting monday morning i took him into the vet and the doctor told me that max s intestinal wall wasn t healing and wasn t likely to we decided to give him until wednesday but i didn t know if he would make it things we re looking grim   monday night was a nightmare he laid on the couch in the same spot staring off into space his eyes were cloudy with death and the look on his face was that of a dog who gave up he had thrown up most of what i fed him that day and he was declining fast he could barely walk now and it was obvious he didn t want to lorie and i decided to put him down tuesday morning and spent monday night with him keeping him comfortable and happy telling stories about his epic  years on this planet monday night i decided since he would be gone the next day i would skip his medication and his feeding since he hated them so much and when tuesday came and he was still or less the same i also skipped breakfast and morning meds for him lorie stayed home tuesday so we could say goodbye to max as a family   then around  am something miraculous happened we noticed max was more awake alert and was now following us around the room with his eyes there was life there when there wasn t before we knew we might be just seeing what we wanted to see but we took it and ran with it we spent tuesday cleaning singing and being as positive as possible and sure enough little bits of life returned not much but it was enough to make the decision to hold on longer i started to research some of the meds he was on and realized of the eight different medication he was taking five of them had side effects of lethargy excessive drooling innapitence nausea vommiting depression and anxiety so i took him off of all of his meds except for his antibiotics put him back on cbd began a probiotic treatment recommended by my sister and started using a special dog food diet for intestinal issues   the following wednesday and thursday were nothing short of miracle days slowly but surely all the things he hasn t been doing over the last few months began returning he spent most of yesterday wanting to go to the dog park following me around the house barking at me too give him food playing with toys and peeing on the couch which is a sign that he s feeling better as that s been his spot for the last decade and he hasn t hit it in months all of his routines and habits are coming back at lightening speed all he needed to do was poop to confirm the surgery worked and to try to eat on his own last night he pooped and this morning for the first time in months he ate breakfast on his own as i type this he s playing with his favorite chewbacca toy as if the last two to three months didn t happen   all of this is completely surreal to us obviously he was a sick sick sick dog and we said goodbye to him so many times but we didn t give up on him when he showed those signs of life while this is what we were hoping for in our wildest dreams it s not at all what we we re expecting it s been such a long emotional road i haven t slept in months and have dropped  pounds because i wasn t eating as well i feared going to bed every night for the fear that the next day would be the one where i would have to say goodbye to my best friend of  years my boy but we didn t give up on him   nearly  hours of syringe feeding   hours of administering iv fluids at home another  or so hours at vet visits speciality clinics and ultrasounds it was worth every single second of it max power won he beat death and he did so with maximum power   there s a quote that has stuck with me through this whole thing   if only the saddest words in the english language   kristan higgins  i didn t want to spend my life wondering if only   and i m so thankful i don t have to i m well aware that max s case is the exception and not the rule and that at his age we don t have much longer but for the time we have left i will treasure every single day as if it s not only his last but mine as well i m so thankful for the lessons and challenges this ordeal has brought for it s made me and my family that much stronger   it s now been several months since he s been getting better last year he was   pounds three days after surgery he was   pounds yesterday he was up to   pounds all he wants to do now is eat and play and explore it s almost as if he s getting younger again   we are back to business as usual we spent this morning as we do every morning at the dog park and as usual he came home ate a big breakfast and is now happily passed out on my lap   i am happy

happy,kamcio616,self.happy,2019-06-23 03:42:28,you never know what lies on the other side of discomfort  if you need some motivation for that job interview or do get something done here is a little story     months ago i had my first ever job interview it just so happened to be for a job i really wanted since i d always dreamed of working in a museum i ve been studying history for the past  years  furthermore the wage on offer was significantly higher than what any of my friends were earning when i left the house with all my fanciest clothes i realised that i hadn t worn my dress shoes in a while and they were far too small eating away at my heel i had about a  minute walk to do in these shoes but i had no alternative pair i stopped and hesitated for a moment wondering if i should go on after just a few steps i could feel that blood had started to seep out and it was extremely painful to walk however i realised that this was the moment that i would look back on in a few months time with either pride or shame i decided to keep going literally limping my way to the train station i finally arrived at the museum only to realise from talking to other people that out of about  of my peers i was the  only  person who s email did not state that i had to prepare a  minute talk to upsell an interesting object now i really knew that today was my day i showed the incomplete email to the interviewers who were extremely apologetic and said i could have as much time as i wanted to myself in a different room to prepare looking in my bag i could see i only had a paper notepad so  it would have to do instead of complaining about my bad luck  i didn t take any time on the side and listened to the other presentations which were excellent most of the people had prior tour museum experience  i then stood up and explained why this particular notepad was the best one money could buy      looking at interviewers  i see all of you have cups of water with you now if you had a normal paper notepad and you spilled your water you d lose all of your precious notes with this notepad and it s waterproof cover page you can be sure that your notes are safe etc etc     limping my way back home i really didn t think i had much of a chance at getting the job all the people there were older much more experienced and  in my eyes considerably better suited for the job the following week i basically stayed at home and didn t go to university since i found it nearly impossible to walk the shoes had cut through multiple layers of skin and the pain was excruciating     however just a few days later i got a call telling me that i had got the job and contracted hours too ever since then it has been an absolute dream working with amazing people and in a great environment i ve now finished my university my studies and work overlapped for about  months and i really couldn t be happier i hadn t thought much about my decisions on that day but now when i think back i feel extremely proud for not giving in since it has paid off tremendously     i hope you all have an amazing day and remember to smile

happy,aniebananie1,self.happy,2020-02-07 20:41:33,after a very hard work week one of my tenants called me and made my week  sorry in advance i ve never posted to this sub and this is going to be a little long but i wanted to share this uplifting experience   to preface i work as a building manager dealing with the day to day dealings and issues in a large apartment complex my job can be very draining as well as and emotionally exhausting this week was very hard as i had an issue with a resident being very volatile and many of the residents were upset and unfortunately i am the first face they see when that happens so i get a lot of negative words and insults thrown my way   i came home today and i am on call and one of my tenants names popped up on the after hours phone and i picked up as you do  ready to get another grievance regarding the disruptive tenant what i got instead was completely the opposite i don t usually speak much about my residents however this wonderful person is someone that i feel i need to talk about this tenant is so so lovely she is so sweet and in every interaction she tells me how much she loves living here and that she is so happy with how the place has changed for the better since i took over she asked to extend her lease and told me that i was kind and wonderful i needed to hear that after this week she is so full of kindness and support she works with children with disabilities and her patience and grace comes through in everything she does she even said how grateful she was that i answered the phone even though it was after hours i was off about  hours ago  she also said that she had lived in a complex when she was in her youth and was happy to see more activities that i had started doing to get to know your neighbors better she made my whole day   her and people like her are the reason that the world has safe places and light in a world that can at times feel unrelenting and bleak if you are on this subreddit you are a person who contributes to that and i thank you

happy,Dappl3jack,self.happy,2020-02-07 12:15:06,helping a colleague so there s this girl that i work with and for the last year or two i ve been getting kind of concerned about her not really about little things either  she came to the christmas party with a weird mark on her face and when i pressed her on it later thinking it would be something silly we could joke about she revealed that when she felt bad she would headbutt her wardrobe until the bad thoughts went away   internally i was like holy shit she self harms but obviously externally i spoke to her a bit i couldve done a better job at that  some things came across as generic as fuck  but i m not really an orator and i was very much put on the spot   other things have since come up nothing quite at that level but enough to remind me that things weren t ok with her after every shift when she d be not right i d message her just to check she wasn t going home and doing something really bad stuff like you ok you seemed a bit down today want to go out for a drink with workmate and workmate    anyway one that really stood out to me was that at the end of my shift i went into the kitchen to sort myself out a coffee and she was lying on the floor fully conscious physically fine but just lying there  my internal klaxons went through the roof  i got her sat at a table fetched her a warm drink and went to speak to the manager we arranged a bit of an agreement  she could go home early if i covered her shift which i said yes to she looked rough but we got her on the bus that takes her to right outside her grans house   i finished her shift  thank god for free coffee  and messaged her about what was going on was she ok etc etc and she was pretty vague about the whole thing but we spoke until i was comfortable with her mental state that she wasn t going to do anything stupid   but and this is the important thing i finished that conversation with the sentence don t be a stranger alright talk to me any time   today she messaged me asking if i thought she should take antidepressants i know that this is a difficult thing to hear so i was as tactful and supportive as possible but i told her that antidepressants are each different and only effective with other mental health care as well else she would just depend on drugs to be happy  i reccomended she speak to a therapist counsellor and she agreed   i know the mental health issues aren t fixed and i know that the road to recovery is long and treacherous at times but i am over the moon that this girl is finally seeking help 
happy,Nartarus,self.happy,2020-03-09 04:24:05,three years ago i was at rock bottom but i found friends that helped me trust again and i am so extremly happy about them and where i am today  this made me very happy so i want to share it with you   i got hurt very badly in my past and lost my ability to trust others out of the fear to get hurt again i was struggling almost no friend and constantly mistrusting the few ones i had because some assholes in the past decided to break my trust   but not anymore it started almost three years ago i have managed to meet amazing people including my now best friend who have accepted me as i am even if i am sometimes weird there are so many things they did that just make me tear up from happiness when i think about it   they were the first to remember my birthday outside of my family they surprised me with a birthday cake and a little motivational book and i was just so amazingly happy the little book still has a special place on my desk   they were the first to convince me to try and go to a party i had never gone out before but they even helped me to dress up and do some makeup and made it such an amazing experience i still cherish it today   they accepted that i don t like to get drunk everyone i knew before them always pushed me get drunk to have fun  they just accepted that i don t want to drink and now they even make me some tea when we hang out because they know i will drink the tea while they get drunk it makes me so happy that they not only accept how i am but even prepare something so i feel better   they were there for me when i had a breakdown when i broke down an started to mistrust everyone again and felt like i would fall into a black hole my best friend even called me to make sure i am okay she even offered to go and openly ridicule the person who made me feel this bad and this support just made me so happy to have a friend who supports me even if i am down   i could go on and on but i just want to say that i am very happy and feel very lucky to have let these special people into my life three years ago i thought that i could never trust anyone again and that everyone would just abuse me now i know that this is not true there are amazing people who cherish me and like me the way they are they have taught me to trust others and myself gain and for this i will be forever grateful

happy,matthewsmazes,self.happy,2021-04-24 10:33:46,after over  decades of planning my animation dreams have begun  since i was twelve years old i ve had a dream to animate score and write a film based on recurring dreams i had as a child i am now   for the past  years i have done everything i can to prepare for this goal starting from scratch  it s been a long road with a lot of great experiences but then end goal has always been the same      here s an overview of the road that has finally lead to my being able to pursue this dream    began playing music at age  and went on to study bass in college  in my early  s i got a job at a bank to get a better sense of how funding and costs work  in my mid  s i created this children s book and read a long video https  youtu be sqvkkwu uxs  the process of creating this was my way of making sure i had what it takes to see a project through to completion it ended up getting me addicted to projects  in    i left my finance job for good after getting a book deal drawing mazes extreme mazes mindware series   i then went on to publish a handful of other maze books as i worked on improving my drawing skills this also helped me learn how the art design world works   also in    i got a lucky break while replying to an online posting it lead to this nationally televised set design art work https  youtu be m n jlf bc    from here i was able to start networking in the chicago film scene and got a gig as a stand in for chicago pd from season  through season  this helped me really understand what the film production process looks like from the inside while animation is different in a lot of ways the overall production process on a tv show set has a lot of overlaps    after this i wanted to increase my project management skills because i knew that any film project will eventually require me to lead a team so i combined my design set work and creative energies and began looking for a fitting pm job unfortunately i couldn t land a job in my target industry animation  but i did get work in fast paced creative based industries trade show amp experiential marketing    i was able to pm hundreds of projects over the past  years and it taught me a lot about being able to adjust to problems working with vendors contractors setting workback schedules managing client expectations etc    so last year    i finally saved enough money to build a pc that can handle the d and d softwares i ve wanted to learn for years while i know adobe pretty well from work throughout the years i ve never gotten to truly dive into blender cinema d maya etc     and that brings me to today earlier this year i let my current employer know that i planned on leaving in may to begin my animation career in earnest i ve saved up a modest amount of money to hold me over while i dive into learning for  months i ve signed up for bootcamps bought courses and started testing my skills just to make sure this is what i want to do   so  here s why i m so happy   i created these two animations on my new gear these are my first attempts at animating and i love the process of making them     there s no doubt in my mind that this is what i want to be doing and i was encouraged to see the results of my first attempts    there s a long long way to go but my dream can finally begin    my first background animation  https  drive google com file d  xrtj dqxqmydcoefy vgxpefji fo view usp sharing   my first character animation  https  drive google com file d  hk tey nbys swsirm bftdfqdxt xn view usp sharing        thanks for reading cheers

happy,atomic_bobomb,self.happy,2019-12-08 12:29:49,i thought i would be dead by now but i just turned  and could never be happier  i wanted to kill myself at least once a year i tried i even told my mom just four years ago that i wish i had never been born i have made two solid attempts hospitalized for three days afterwards and recommended to try drugs for my ptsd this was the first ptsd diagnosis ever this year i have had so many more suicidal thoughts probably more than i have had in any year of my life because of a lot of psychological trauma that happened but last night just made me so mad at myself   i got there at   pm with my boyfriend not  minutes later the first person showed up then shortly afterward the second then a third and forth then a fifth and sixth then a seventh eighth the number kept climbing higher and higher i told the venue i didn t expect many people maybe  at most they of course gave away my reservation to another table despite being  minutes early which we weren t aware of so we sat down at the large table that had a reserved sign on it  i don t fault them for that because mixups happen   the staff came over after realizing they gave away my table and asked us to move because the table we sat at was for a group of   not only did  people not show up but i ended up having  people there at one time excluding myself i felt a little good about that because i honestly didn t expect that many people to begin with and clearly neither did the establishment it was all good though because they were really kind at accommodating us and shit happens but wow that moment when you have all these people there just to see you just me that hit me really hard in the heart those people made the effort   i am honestly so overwhelmed with emotion and all of it is actually positive for once i didn t think i would make it this far but i am sure glad i did

happy,JasmineHodgess,self.happy,2020-09-05 17:30:46,what are some suggestions for things to do daily for one to feel happy here are some things i do that work for me     get into nature  take a short walk eat lunch outside go to a park for a half hour even open a window and listen to the rain taking a few minutes to connect with the natural world help me feel grounded and relaxed     meditation  at first it was very difficult to sit still for that long but after the first week i started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head i was perceiving things poorly from past images that i d clung onto    yoga  please look after your body as well as your life follow your internal compass  your intuition if something feels right you ll know even more poignantly like in yoga if something feels wrong you ll know for certain when you re practicing yoga the movements at hand require a level of focus that demands that you be in the present moment the practice pulls you from your thoughts because it is stronger than them getting into your body in this way is an antidote for rumination and a soother of worry there are times to think but during yoga you are only required to move and it requires your full participation    ritual  for me it s making an afternoon cup of tea having a small ritual like this that you do at the same time every day provides a touchstone in the day it s best if the ritual is a healthy one of course i e  not lighting up a cigarette or pouring a drink    avoid drama and the people who cause it  drama is what i call the manufactured junk that causes conflict and unhappiness some people seem like they must always be submerged in drama my husband and i decided long ago that we weren t going to tolerate it we don t befriend people who bring drama and we work to keep it out of our relationship it helps us deal much better with the real ups and and downs of life    try to maximize time spent on activities that induce flow   flow is the term for that magical time when you re so immersed in what you re doing that you don t really notice the time passing we are happiest when we are in flow so when you do something and realize this is happening make a mental note of it and try to build time into your days for similar activities   if you are interested there s a lot out there to get you started i recommend the mindfulness amp yoga apps but please find what suits you if you have any apps or sites you want to share please do    disclaimer  this is not an advertisement i am sharing knowledge of the apps i m not affiliated with any of the links below    apps i use    zenia app great yoga app that sees my movements and tells me when my asanas aren t correct free version sub based   https  get zenia app brf f f    https  get zenia app brf f f     nike training club a great app to diversify your classes and try out new workouts  free   https  apps apple com ru app nike training club id      https  apps apple com ru app nike training club id       headspace meditation amp mindfulness free version sub based   https  www headspace com  https  www headspace com  i think everyone knows this app  fabulous a science based app incubated in duke s behavioral economics lab that will help you build healthy rituals into your life just like an elite athlete  https  www thefabulous co  https  www thefabulous co    find what works for you discard the rest good luck

happy,Oculata,self.happy,2019-12-24 02:54:29,i learned something about my dad today and it made me really happy and i wanted to share it  my dad is a doctor he graduated medical school the year i was born     and trained as a general pediatrician and then worked for more than  years and took care of so many people that i actually ran into the one when i was   miles from home but that is quite a different story  after he closed his practice in nj he moved to florida but just couldn t stop working he didn t have to keep working he just couldn t stop because being a doctor was all he ever wanted to be so he started working in an urgent care center near where he lives in florida  well sort of it s a  minute drive each way which probably isn t a big deal but he s now  years old and he s been doing this for more than  years   so i called him tonight to catch up and wish him a happy hanukkah and asked him what he was up to this week and he said that tomorrow christmas eve he was going to work an  hour shift he said that he always worked christmas eve so that other people who had families and who actually celebrated christmas could be with their families it was the first time he told me that and it s just made me stop and think a couple of things first it made me see again that my dad is just a really good person a really decent and stand up guy he wasn t asked to work christmas eve he doesn t have to work he just does it   second it made me imagine him sitting there in his urgent care center white coat and the same stethoscope he s had for decades slung around his neck sitting in an urgent care center while patients trickle in going from exam room to exam room hunting and pecking away on the computer keyboard because he s  and electronic medical records are just not his thing  and drinking coffee and then after a long long day he ll drive home for a half and hour and then probably fall asleep on the couch watching tv like he did  years ago when i was a kid and i remember him coming home after a long day it s the picture of my dad that i ll always remember   and finally i realized that he doesn t ask for attaboys or accolades or recognition he doesn t do things like this for thanks or praise or best urgent care doc of the month  he just does it because that s who he is and dammit if that just doesn t make me really proud to be his  year old son   so if you re in sarasota florida on christmas eve   and you want to meet a really good guy go poke your head in at the american family urgent care ask for dr blackman my dad   he ll be there waiting to help someone

happy,minimalistcookie,self.happy,2020-08-22 13:16:41,how to increase happiness serotonin in the human brain without drugs   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc        how to increase serotonin in the human brain without drugs   simon n young https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed term young  sn bauthor d amp cauthor true amp cauthor uid       for the last  decades the question of how to manipulate the serotonergic system with drugs has been an important area of research in biological psychiatry and this research has led to advances in the treatment of depression research on the association between various polymorphisms and depression supports the idea that serotonin plays a role not only in the treatment of depression but also in susceptibility to depression and suicide the research focus here has been on polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter but other serotonin related genes may also be involved    https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   in the future genetic research will make it possible to predict with increasing accuracy who is susceptible to depression much less attention has been given to how this information will be used for the benefit of individuals with a serotonin related susceptibility to depression and little evidence exists concerning strategies to prevent depression in those with such a susceptibility various studies have looked at early intervention in those with prodromal symptoms as well as at population strategies for preventing depression    https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   obviously prevention is preferable to early intervention moreover although population strategies are important they are ideally supplemented with preventive interventions that can be used over long periods of time in targeted individuals who do not yet exhibit even nonclinical symptoms clearly pharmacologic approaches are not appropriate and given the evidence for serotonin s role in the etiology and treatment of depression nonpharmacologic methods of increasing serotonin are potential candidates to test for their ability to prevent depression   another reason for pursuing nonpharmacologic methods of increasing serotonin arises from the increasing recognition that happiness and well being are important both as factors protecting against mental and physical disorders and in their own right     https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   conversely negative moods are associated with negative outcomes for example the negative mood hostility is a risk factor for many disorders for the sake of brevity hostility is discussed here mainly in relation to one of the biggest sources of mortality coronary heart disease chd  a meta analysis of  studies demonstrated that hostility is a risk factor for chd and for all cause mortality   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   more recent research confirms this hostility is associated not only with the development of chd but also with poorer survival in coronary artery disease cad patients   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   hostility may lead to decreased social support and social isolation   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   and low perceived social support is associated with greater mortality in those with cad   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   effects are not just limited to chd for example the opposite of hostility agreeableness was a significant protective factor against mortality in a sample of older frail participants   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r     the constitution of the who states health is a state of complete physical mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity    https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   this may sound exaggerated but positive mood within the normal range is an important predictor of health and longevity in a classic study those in the lowest quartile for positive emotions rated from autobiographies written at a mean age of  years died on average  years earlier than those in the highest quartile   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   even taking into account possible confounders other studies found the same solid link between feeling good and living longer    https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   in a series of recent studies negative emotions were associated with increased disability due to mental and physical disorders   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   increased incidence of depression   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   increased suicide   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   and increased mortality   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   up to  decades later positive emotions protected against these outcomes a recent review including meta analyses assessed cross sectional longitudinal and experimental studies and concluded that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   mood may influence social behaviour and social support is one of the most studied psychosocial factors in relation to health and disease   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   low social support is associated with higher levels of stress depression dysthymia and posttraumatic stress disorder and with increased morbidity and mortality from a host of medical illnesses   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r     research confirms what might be intuitively expected that positive emotions and agreeableness foster congenial relationships with others   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r      https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   this in turn will create the conditions for an increase in social support   several studies found an association between measures related to serotonin and mood in the normal range lower platelet serotonin receptor function was associated with lower mood in one study   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   whereas better mood was associated with higher blood serotonin levels in another   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   two studies found that greater prolactin release in response to fenfluramine was associated with more positive mood   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r      https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   the idea that these associations indicate a causal association between serotonin function and mood within the normal range is consistent with a study demonstrating that in healthy people with high trait irritability tryptophan relative to placebo decreased quarrelsome behaviours increased agreeable behaviours and improved mood   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   serotonin may be associated with physical health as well as mood in otherwise healthy individuals a low prolactin response to the serotonin releasing drug fenfluramine was associated with the metabolic syndrome a risk factor for heart disease   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   suggesting that low serotonin may predispose healthy individuals to suboptimal physical as well as mental functioning   nonpharmacologic methods of raising brain serotonin may not only improve mood and social functioning of healthy people  a worthwhile objective even without additional considerations  but would also make it possible to test the idea that increases in brain serotonin may help protect against the onset of various mental and physical disorders four strategies that are worth further investigation are discussed below   the article by perreau linck and colleagues   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r    page   of this issue provides an initial lead about one possible strategy for raising brain serotonin using positron emission tomography they obtained a measure of serotonin synthesis in the brains of healthy participants who underwent positive negative and neutral mood inductions reported levels of happiness were positively correlated and reported levels of sadness were negatively correlated with serotonin synthesis in the right anterior cingulate cortex the idea that alterations in thought either self induced or due to psychotherapy can alter brain metabolism is not new numerous studies have demonstrated changes in blood flow in such circumstances however reports related to specific transmitters are much less common in one recent study meditation was reported to increase release of dopamine   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   the study by perreau linck and colleagues   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   is the first to report that self induced changes in mood can influence serotonin synthesis this raises the possibility that the interaction between serotonin synthesis and mood may be  way with serotonin influencing mood and mood influencing serotonin obviously more work is needed to answer questions in this area for example is the improvement in mood associated with psychotherapy accompanied by increases in serotonin synthesis if more precise information is obtained about the mental states that increase serotonin synthesis will this help to enhance therapy techniques   exposure to bright light is a second possible approach to increasing serotonin without drugs bright light is of course a standard treatment for seasonal depression but a few studies also suggest that it is an effective treatment for nonseasonal depression   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   and also reduces depressed mood in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   and in pregnant women suffering from depression   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   the evidence relating these effects to serotonin is indirect in human postmortem brain serotonin levels are higher in those who died in summer than in those who died in winter   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   a similar conclusion came from a study on healthy volunteers in which serotonin synthesis was assessed by measurements of the serotonin metabolite  hydroxyindoleacetic acid  hiaa in the venous outflow from the brain   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   there was also a positive correlation between serotonin synthesis and the hours of sunlight on the day the measurements were made independent of season in rats serotonin is highest during the light part of the light dark cycle and this state is driven by the photic cycle rather than the circadian rhythm   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r      https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   the existence of a retinoraphe tract may help explain why in experimental animals neuronal firing rates  c fos expression and the serotonin content in the raphe nuclei are responsive to retinal light exposure     https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   in humans there is certainly an interaction between bright light and the serotonin system the mood lowering effect of acute tryptophan depletion in healthy women is completely blocked by carrying out the study in bright light    lux instead of dim light   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r     relatively few generations ago most of the world population was involved in agriculture and was outdoors for much of the day this would have resulted in high levels of bright light exposure even in winter even on a cloudy day the light outside can be greater than   lux a level never normally achieved indoors in a recent study carried out at around latitude   n daily exposure to light greater than   lux averaged about  minutes in winter and only about  minutes in summer   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   among people working at least  hours weekly weekends were included in this group summer bright light exposure was probably considerably less than the winter exposure of our agricultural ancestors we may be living in a bright light deprived society a large literature that is beyond the scope of this editorial exists on the beneficial effect of bright light exposure in healthy individuals lamps designed for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder which provide more lux than is ever achieved by normal indoor lighting are readily available although incorporating their use into a daily routine may be a challenge for some however other strategies both personal and institutional exist  light cafes pioneered in scandinavia have come to the united kingdom   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   and an austrian village that receives no sunshine in the winter because of its surrounding mountains is building a series of giant mirrors to reflect sunlight into the valley   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   better use of daylight in buildings is an issue that architects are increasingly aware of working indoors does not have to be associated with suboptimal exposure to bright light   a third strategy that may raise brain serotonin is exercise a comprehensive review of the relation between exercise and mood concluded that antidepressant and anxiolytic effects have been clearly demonstrated   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   in the united kingdom the national institute for health and clinical excellence which works on behalf of the national health service and makes recommendations on treatments according to the best available evidence has published a guide on the treatment of depression   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   the guide recommends treating mild clinical depression with various strategies including exercise rather than antidepressants because the risk benefit ratio is poor for antidepressant use in patients with mild depression exercise improves mood in subclinical populations as well as in patients the most consistent effect is seen when regular exercisers undertake aerobic exercise at a level with which they are familiar   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   however some skepticism remains about the antidepressant effect of exercise and the national institute of mental health in the united states is currently funding a clinical trial of the antidepressant effect of exercise that is designed to overcome sources of potential bias and threats to internal and external validity that have limited previous research   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r     several lines of research suggest that exercise increases brain serotonin function in the human brain post and colleagues   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   measured biogenic amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid csf of patients with depression before and after they increased their physical activity to simulate mania physical activity increased  hiaa but it is not clear that this was due to increased serotonin turnover or to mixing of csf from higher regions which contain higher levels of  hiaa with lumbar csf or to a combination of both mechanisms  nonetheless this finding stimulated many animal studies on the effects of exercise for example chaouloff and colleagues   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   showed that exercise increased tryptophan and  hiaa in rat ventricles more recent studies using intracerebral dialysis have shown that exercise increases extracellular serotonin and  hiaa in various brain areas including the hippocampus and cortex for example see    https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r    two different mechanisms may be involved in this effect as reviewed by jacobs and fornal   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   motor activity increases the firing rates of serotonin neurons and this results in increased release and synthesis of serotonin   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   in addition there is an increase in the brain of the serotonin precursor tryptophan that persists after exercise   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r     the largest body of work in humans looking at the effect of exercise on tryptophan availability to the brain is concerned with the hypothesis that fatigue during exercise is associated with elevated brain tryptophan and serotonin synthesis a large body of evidence supports the idea that exercise including exercise to fatigue is associated with an increase in plasma tryptophan and a decrease in the plasma level of the branched chain amino acids bcaas leucine isoleucine and valine see   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r      https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   for reviews  the bcaas inhibit tryptophan transport into the brain   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   because of the increase in plasma tryptophan and decrease in bcaa there is a substantial increase in tryptophan availability to the brain tryptophan is an effective mild hypnotic   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   a fact that stimulated the hypothesis that it may be involved in fatigue a full discussion of this topic is not within the scope of this editorial however it is notable that several clinical trials of bcaa investigated whether it was possible to counter fatigue by lowering brain tryptophan with results that provided little support for the hypothesis further exercise results in an increase in the plasma ratio of tryptophan to the bcaas before the onset of fatigue   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r      https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   the conclusion of these studies is that in humans a rise in precursor availability should increase serotonin synthesis during and after exercise and that this is not related to fatigue although it may be related to improved mood whether motor activity increases the firing rate of serotonin neurons in humans as in animals is not known however it is clear that aerobic exercise can improve mood   as with exposure to bright light there has been a large change in the level of vigorous physical exercise experienced since humans were hunter gatherers or engaged primarily in agriculture   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   lambert   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   argued that the decline in vigorous physical exercise and in particular in effort based rewards may contribute to the high level of depression in today s society the effect of exercise on serotonin suggests that the exercise itself not the rewards that stem from exercise may be important if trials of exercise to prevent depression are successful then prevention of depression can be added to the numerous other benefits of exercise   the fourth factor that could play a role in raising brain serotonin is diet according to some evidence tryptophan which increases brain serotonin in humans as in experimental animals   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   is an effective antidepressant in mild to moderate depression   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r      https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   further in healthy people with high trait irritability it increases agreeableness decreases quarrelsomeness and improves mood   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   however whether tryptophan should be considered primarily as a drug or a dietary component is a matter of some dispute in the united states it is classified as a dietary component but canada and some european countries classify it as a drug treating tryptophan as a drug is reasonable because first there is normally no situation in which purified tryptophan is needed for dietary reasons and second purified tryptophan and foods containing tryptophan have different effects on brain serotonin although purified tryptophan increases brain serotonin foods containing tryptophan do not   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   this is because tryptophan is transported into the brain by a transport system that is active toward all the large neutral amino acids and tryptophan is the least abundant amino acid in protein there is competition between the various amino acids for the transport system so after the ingestion of a meal containing protein the rise in the plasma level of the other large neutral amino acids will prevent the rise in plasma tryptophan from increasing brain tryptophan the idea common in popular culture that a high protein food such as turkey will raise brain tryptophan and serotonin is unfortunately false another popular myth that is widespread on the internet is that bananas improve mood because of their serotonin content although it is true that bananas contain serotonin it does not cross the blood brain barrier    lactalbumin a minor constituent of milk is one protein that contains relatively more tryptophan than most proteins acute ingestion of  lactalbumin by humans can improve mood and cognition in some circumstances presumably owing to increased serotonin   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r      https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   enhancing the tryptophan content of the diet chronically with  lactalbumin is probably not practical however increasing the tryptophan content of the diet relative to that of the other amino acids is something that possibly occurred in the past and could occur again in the future kerem and colleagues   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   studied the tryptophan content of both wild chickpeas and the domesticated chickpeas that were bred from them in the near east in neolithic times the mean protein content per mg dry seed was similar for  cultivars and  wild varieties in the cultivated group however the tryptophan content was almost twice that of the wild seeds interestingly the greater part of the increase was due to an increase in the free tryptophan content i e  not part of the protein  in cultivated chickpeas almost two thirds of the tryptophan was in the free form kerem and colleagues   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   argue that there was probably selection for seeds with a higher tryptophan content this is plausible given another example of an early strategy to increase the available tryptophan content of an important food source pellagra is a disorder caused by niacin deficiency usually owing to poverty and a diet relying heavily on corn maize  which has a low level of niacin and its precursor tryptophan cultures in the americas that relied greatly on corn used alkali during its processing e g  boiling the corn in lime when making tortillas  this enhanced the nutritional quality of the corn by increasing the bioavailability of both niacin and tryptophan a practice that prevented pellagra   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   the europeans transported corn around the world but did not transport the traditional alkali processing methods thereby causing epidemics of pellagra in past centuries breeding corn with a higher tryptophan content was shown in the   s to prevent pellagra   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r    presumably it also raised brain serotonin in a recent issue of nature biotechnology  morris and sands   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   argue that plant breeders should be focusing more on nutrition than on yield they ask  could consumption of tryptophan rich foods play a role in reducing the prevalence of depression and aggression in society  cross national studies have reported a positive association between corn consumption and homicide rates   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   and a negative association between dietary tryptophan and suicide rates   https  www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc     r   although the idea behind such studies is interesting any causal attribution must remain speculative given the possible confounds nonetheless the possibility that the mental health of a population could be improved by increasing the dietary intake of tryptophan relative to the dietary intake of other amino acids remains an interesting idea that should be explored   the primary purpose of this editorial is to point out that pharmacologic strategies are not the only ones worthy of study when devising strategies to increase brain serotonin function the effect of nonpharmacologic interventions on brain serotonin and the implications of increased serotonin for mood and behaviour need to be studied more the amount of money and effort put into research on drugs that alter serotonin is very much greater than that put into non pharmacologic methods the magnitude of the discrepancy is probably neither in tune with the wishes of the public nor optimal for progress in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders

happy,black_impala_65,self.happy,2021-06-08 12:37:26,the day i truly felt like i became a dad so to offer some background i took up the responsibility of becoming a single parent last year i had contemplated taking in an older kid not only because i thought i could at least leave them alone during the day when i was at work but also because i knew how often older kids get passed up in the system for babies toddlers and young kids and after getting in touch with my agency i eventually found out about a kid that was actually my neighbor at one point having lived in the same apartment building as me she lived three doors down from me and i remember chatting with her casually a few times because she would just hang out outside her apartment every day i had no idea she was the victim of abuse from her mother and felt terrible i remember the day her social worker introduced me to her i had to remind her of our interactions and once she remembered she had the biggest smile on her face once i took her in and i spent the first week home with her it went fairly well there were some bad habits i had to help break like she used to swear casually just thought it was normal and some other small things but we got over it over the proceeding months and she s been good ever since i trust and love her and she trusts and loves me   so the event in question happened about two months ago i was going to be gone for a business trip for about three weeks and had to leave my daughter with my brother and my niece and nephew she didn t mind staying with them but was understandably upset at the idea of me being gone for so long she wasn t having a breakdown or anything just kind of forlorn and sullen it broke my heart seeing her like that but i made sure to make our last night together as memorable as possible and stayed up way later than i should have just for her sake the next morning i left and it took every fiber of my being to step outside and leave but somehow i did   i kept in touch with her and my sister regularly just to make sure everything was going well needless to say i hated being gone and wanted nothing more than to hop back in my car and go home the thing i left for was so needlessly boring and tedious beyond imagining i mean sure i liked being with my co workers and meeting new people but i would rather be elsewhere of course somehow i got through it though and woke up extremely early the next morning and put petal to the metal to get home don t worry i slept enough and wasn t tired while driving or anything like that  it was like something out of a hallmark movie because when i got to my brother s she literally burst out of the front door and jumped into my arms nearly knocking me over  she acts like i just came home from war or something i said to my brother and all three of us laughed this was the moment i truly felt like a dad because i was just so in the moment for once in my life and didn t think about anything else except her and me it s that thing where we just look at each other and smile not saying anything and we just know how much we care about each other we touched our heads and even i felt myself cry a little bit   that day in particular was the day for me and it mad me realize that for me the hardest thing about being a parent so far isn t having to deal with her bad days or stuff at school or any of that it s knowing i can t always be around    yes she has my brother and other family to count on for support and is close with all of them but the idea of her being gone one day and off to college or wherever she goes frightens me a bit i know it shouldn t but it does nevertheless i try to focus on the here and now as much as i can and do anything and everything for her if i really had to do it all over again i would ve gotten her out of that place and away from her mom much sooner

happy,jalwy,self.happy,2021-06-18 23:17:16,the story of how i fell in love with another woman  throughout high school i dated a handful of guys but none of them were ever serious as i was attracted to them but never really would have considered marriage with any of them during my freshman year of college i was introduced to a guy who played on the baseball team and i quickly fell in love with him after three years of dating he proposed and we wed in a beautiful ceremony at the church both my parents and grandparents had married we soon welcomed a beautiful baby boy and four years later another son   i don t want to focus extensively on the falling of our marriage so i ll try to keep it short and simple after having our second son things became tense my ex no longer seemed to want the responsibility of being a father to our two young boys he stayed out late after work and would go straight to sleep upon arriving home for the sake of our two very young children i stayed in the marriage for as long as i could i eventually learned that he was having multiple affairs and came to the conclusion that i needed to get out   i was granted sole custody of our boys and we moved back home to be closer to my parents occasionally my parents would force me to go on social outings with friends for the sake of my own sanity my hometown friends had made lots of new connections since i had left town so nearly every outing i was meeting new people and making new friends   during one of our girls night out i was seated next to a very tall woman whom i had not met before we ended up talking nearly the entire night away and i instantly felt a bond between us i learned that she was the vice president of a rather large company and that she had worked all the way up from the ceos personal assistant to his number two executive i was beyond impressed and became even more intrigued subsequently i learned she was only a year older than me yet she had never been married and had no children   we exchanged phone numbers and promised to keep in touch i figured that i had just made another friendship but this one felt different she was so down to earth and didn t gossip about others the entire night which was a breath of fresh air she seemed like a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulder and that was exactly the type of person i wanted to befriend during a period where i was already under enough stress   we soon started meeting up just the two of us and i learned even more about her personal life she revealed to me that she was gay and had known since she was just eight years old she had come out of the closet years ago but hadn t had a serious relationship since high school a spouse and kids were something she always wanted but she felt it may never happen i consoled her and opened up more about my own struggles over the past few years   within just a few months of knowing each other we became best friends we did something together nearly every weekend and she would come over to my place after work to play with the kids who quickly came to adore her and give me some rest time  i somehow didn t realize it at the time but she was trying to make the point that she loved my boys and would do anything to be with me and raise them as her own   it was during a lunch outing one afternoon that she revealed her feelings towards me she told me that she didn t want it to change our relationship but felt that it needed to be said that romance was on her mind i told her that i needed to think about it quickly i saw her facial expression go from nervous to sad i started to think about everything in my head at that moment deep down i had developed feelings for her as well it was all just so confusing to me i had never been into another woman like that and besides her i could not find another woman attractive even if i wanted to   i thought about all she had done for me and how great she was with my boys looking at her sad face i grabbed her arm and told her that i wanted to be more than friends her expression changed to a mixture of shock and delight i told her to ask me out she did and we went on our first date the next evening   things only got better from that point on our friends were shocked but beyond ecstatic for us upon hearing the news she held my hand everywhere we went and always made it a point to declare that i was her girlfriend i thought it was the cutest thing that she was obsessed with me that s when i realized that we were probably going to get married i had never had any interest in a woman prior to meeting her and now here i was on the verge of being married to one   she proposed on our one year anniversary we married in the most amazing destination wedding just seven months later i quickly became pregnant and we welcomed our first daughter ten months after the wedding since then we ve welcomed three more daughters and i have a fifth in my belly as we speak three years ago my wife was promoted to ceo of her company despite holding such a powerful position she always puts plenty of time aside for the kids and myself i am beyond proud of her and honestly just honored to be able to do life with such an amazing person   i must say that i don t even see or think about her gender anymore it s all pure love we are soulmates it s a type of love and emotion i never felt with a guy and sure wouldn t ever feel with any other woman i love her for her and that s the most amazing feeling to be in love with someone just purely from the heart

happy,wtfisgoingon2069,self.happy,2021-10-08 09:38:20,how i am almost happy approaching  and depressed ever since i can remember starting to figure some things out take a look if you want some ideas  hey guys just want to share my story i am almost  years old ever since i could remember i ve always been depressed sad and angry even as a kid got into alcohol weed and a lot of sex with random women that i had no desire to be with long term to keep it simple and short i ve eliminated the first two and have been sober for two years i still find my self meeting new women all the time but i try and be conscious of it because it seems like i use sex as a means of coping with depression anger and sadness i meditate every day now and that has helped quite a bit i stay active on a good diet and take vitamin d and creatine everyday both have shown to help with feeling better as a result of all this i am sleeping better at night which has created a dominoe effect on the rest of my life the more recovered i am the stronger mindset i have to take on a new day   please don t ever give up i am starting to realize that life is a process that needs daily maintenance don t rush through anything develop a plan enjoy each step and make adjustments here and there when needed you don t need drugs or other people all you need is within although google and the internet have almost been a god send with connecting with other people hearing their stories and finding articles that are science based that gives me a better idea of what and what not to look for whether it s diet behaviors exercises how to sleep better all that plays a part it s just a big puzzle and i hope each and everyone of you has fun solving it because i truly believe that s what life is about   peace

happy,Dulapeep321,self.happy,2022-01-02 10:56:27,summary of my   and the things i have learnt  hi i m only  years old i m a student whos stuck from lockdown i am extremely bored but i wrote this on my personal diary because i love journalling it would probably give me nostalgia if i reread my diary when i grow up that s why i must not lose it     was one of the most boring year in my life but i grew up alot as a person   i didn t have alot of opportunities to meet new people because i couldn t go to school because of the pandemic i lost my best friend of  years because we grew apart my friend who i met at class seems socially awkward and we only talk about schoolwork and memes i tried to initiate something else as a conversation didn t work but i ve talked to my cousins face to face and was able to socialize they were my best friends ever since we were born because we are neighbors i use omegle and reddit to have online friends i ve only met one   note i still love my friend because he s a true friend to me he s not a good communicator tho but thats ok for me   another negative that i experienced is mental health issues i took lamotrigine and quetiapine for bipolar disorder my mom had postpartum depression and things became difficult   the positive thing is that i had time to discover myself as a person and practiced self love and maturity i ve learned that people are consistently growing up as a person i am trying my best to head to the right direction and focus on myself into becoming happier healthier and into becoming a better person my   may have been filled with boredom anxiety losing a childhood friend and mood swings but i grew up and learnt from my struggles of bipolar and social deprivation from the pandemic   things i ve learnt in      empathy is the best thing to have when forming connections with people   our struggles teach us lessons in life everything happens for a reason   self love is the key to happiness it comes from within not from other people   problems are temporary depression tricked me into believing it would only get worse for me and nobody cares about me   life is like a rollercoaster we all have have ups and downs in life  mine is just a little bit too extreme   everyone dies someday that s why you have to make the best out of your life   money is not the key to happiness   we are constantly growing and maturing as a person make sure we are heading to the right direction   treat yourself with kindness the same way you treat others with kindness   meditation calms your mind

happy,Dulapeep321,self.happy,2021-08-21 11:13:30,how i learnt how to love myself at the age of   i am not the problem i am strong and constantly growing as a person  hi i am a  year old teenager who became introspective and self aware about himself i am from a very unstable family when i was in th grade i had suicidal thoughts feelings that my problems would go on and on and will not stop hated myself but then i realized i had an ambition i always thought of saving somebody from suicide and changing the lives of others i always wanted to become a psychotherapist and write philosophical stuff theories on my personal diary of thoughts which i hide   amp x  b   when i was in th th grade i was kind of a people pleaser too na ve tried to see the good in all repressed my anger in order to avoid conflicts didn t know when things are going too far but then in th grade i realized that boundaries must be created   amp x  b   my parents are not really good parents my mom is emotionally unstable very bossy sometimes gets mad randomly while my dad constantly invalidates my feelings and gaslights me i cannot get in therapy they think its useless both of them constantly fights there is no more understanding agreement between them my mom is very manipulative towards my dad threatens to leave us if she didn t get what she want then my dad would get scared and follow anyways convinced them to get to family therapy didn t work they think its a waste of time they never really understood that relationships could recover beautifully even if i told them that i told my dad the repressed anger and sadness i have been keeping for years ended up getting told to just accept it got invalidated i know that my parents are not perfect in raising me nobody is perfect   amp x  b   someday in the future i will heal myself from this trauma and now i just have to endure that i am from a very dysfunctional family i usually just vent to my best friends or online i really want to move out and go to a university currently in grade   only  more years cant really make new friends or go out due to the pandemic its very strict here so i just have to message or video call my previous friends that i trust   amp x  b   i know that this will probably follow me through my adulthood due to the fact that i never really felt loved so i daydream every night about finding someone who would accept me for who i am understand me help me grow and mature as a person but then i realized i have myself i know that i am an amazing and a lovable person who deserves to be loved people have told me i am soft hearted open minded a great listener never invalidates intelligent and not a judgmental person i confirmed what they said because i finally know my mindset after allowing time for myself   amp x  b    this is how i learnt how to love and know myself    amp x  b    i identified the positive things about me in which i truly believe in regardless of what some people say    amp x  b   i am soft hearted and kind because of my ambitions on becoming a psychotherapist helping people heal themselves save people i know i cant save every person help the world but saving one would mean the world to them   amp x  b   i know i am a great listener and open minded because i would often listen with an open mind and an open heart i don t invalidate because i believe that the person that can know you the most is yourself you shouldn t just brush it off tell that there are many other problems i empathize   amp x  b   i know i am not judgmental because i have this mindset where i view people like a spectrum between bad and good i believe everyone has flaws and it is up to us if we are going to accept them or not depending on the severity of their traits i know that every behavior has a reason so i should be open and know from their perspective sometimes people deserve to be forgiven but i usually don t talk to them afterwards but remove grudges   amp x  b   nd   amp x  b    i identified the negative traits about me and determined if i should improve it or accept it    amp x  b   i know i am a person who can take a lot of personal stuff from people very giving too kind and na ve but now i know that i have attracted a lot of toxic people i focused more on myself and decided to cut them all out and keep the ones who i feel like i can trust and are decent and genuinely wants me to be happy and okay i learnt that its better to have a few close friends than to have a lot of friends started realizing when i was in th grade   improvement    amp x  b   another thing i daydream a lot i can sometimes be very unaware of my surroundings which annoys my parents but i accept that it gives me insights about life makes me know more things deeply gives me encouragement and hope   acceptance    amp x  b   that s all i know for a fact this will follow me from adulthood but it would be my responsibility to heal myself i know that i have myself me and my friends may someday stop reconnecting but i know that i have and i love myself someday i hope to find the one who will love me help me for more improvement idk if i would forgive my parents because i realized that parents are not perfect in raising a child i just have to focus on endurance acceptance and maturity for  more years

happy,Nicolasforero,self.happy,2021-08-20 23:19:23,how to be happy instead of miserable when you become   millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal but few define what happiness means often leading us to chase what our parents friends and role models defined as happiness so when we are back to wearing diapers we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed   in my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and science backed studies about happiness i ve found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isn t it s like an inverse happiness checklist   in it you write what doesn t bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy doesn t include any of the items from the checklist   the inverse checklist serves two purposes it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life   so for example if you conclude money doesn t bring joy but you work from   because hustle is life  then reduce the number of say side projects you have otherwise you ll be frustrated after reaching financial freedom and likely feel physically and mentally exhausted   each person s definition of happiness varies however most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness    your definition of happiness cannot reject distress  we can t control the decisions and behaviors of humans animals or nature otherwise hurricanes and phone thieves wouldn t exist so no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner   to avoid the discomfort from harmful events some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life for example they quit their job to run from their nerve racking boss or switch majors the issue with this list is its potential size it s infinite because any event in our lives can distress us   a more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life and realizing happiness can coexist with events that don t match our definition of a perfect activity day or life for example a harmless event like microsoft word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day or it could become a fun challenge to overcome   when you welcome distress you experience two benefits first you become used to different causes of discomfort reducing their chances of affecting you second you realize distress can and must coexist with happiness      your definition of happiness cannot come from others  most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us leading to repentance during our deathbed for example some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents while others seek minimalism according to a monk s advice   in college psychologists doctors and nurses taught me around   of older people under palliative care regretted their lives choices but you don t need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life so instead change it today   first write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life you can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them second answer the most crucial question  who s someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness    ask yourself one last question  is this goal worth pursuing even though x person shares it    contrast your answer with other items from your checklist so if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside goal  your friends feel the same influence  but your inverse checklist says you don t like being away from the city then stop pursuing that goal    avoid being miserable on your deathbed   while your dna differs from the millions of people who have regretted their life s choices on their deathbeds you may be following another person s definition of happiness just like they did unfortunately the old and sick don t have the strength to change their lives drastically but you do   so start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept one you truly believe    share one item you would add to your inverse happiness checklist below  if you are not comfortable doing it publicly please dm me on twitter at  mrnicolasforero  i m curious to discover what you would add

happy,ugghhno,self.happy,2021-09-20 10:58:19,i finally found a way to get insurance to cover seeing a psychiatrist and i got a promotion while i was at work today i learned that i m actually eligible for health insurance and the largest bill is the first one but after that it s only a few dollars to call them and have a conversation i can get a diagnosis and some medications if needed which is honestly really almost ground breaking for me i ve been going through a lot and my parents refused to actually put me in therapy and what not awhile ago so it s just a great feeling that i can finally do that   another great thing is the fact that my manager came up to me and let me know that she s going to move some people around and possibly give me a higher paying position than she originally planned that honestly was just great to find out especially given the fact that it s a    raise i was struggling for money at the beginning of the year and the fact that i won t have to worry about that as much once i get this position is just amazing i m just super excited and i should be starting around saturday if everything works out

happy,Zyzizzy,self.happy,2021-03-11 02:37:47,i know this probably isn t much to be happy about but my day is starting off amazing already bc me and a couple of teammates went to walmart and to get food and at some point during the ride we rolled over something and my teammates asked what was that to which i jokingly commented  that was a body  however when i had got to walmart i realized i didnt have my wallet or airpods for the most part and began to panic once we got back i only let one teammate know what was going on and immediately we looked all through my room and my dorm then she suggested we take a walk because i mentioned placing my phone on the car and we thought it couldve flew off we walked for like  minutes and my hopes were looking pretty dim and then she decided maybe its best we look back in the room and i agreed with her saying  yea i feel as though if it fell off the car we wouldve noticed and said something like  what was that  then we both shared a look before our face broke out into disbelief and basically ran towards the direction when we originally said that and lucky me there was l my wallet and airpods although they were broke laying on the ground on the side of the rode but i was happy to take what i could get  so it s a good day so far

friends and not once has it ever worked out i ve tried a bit of casual dating here and there but i always felt a bit out of step with how the dating world works   the biggest event that made me feel that something was a bit off was sometime last year when some friends and i were at a bar my friend was explaining how to go about meeting potential dates at bars and the like and he was talking about how you just have to find someone attractive and go talk to them he asked me about the qualities i find attractive in a person or what my type is and i just had absolutely no answers i tried to explain that i don t really care about looks much and that i care more about personality and how i connect with somebody his response was that those are definitely important factors but when it comes to initiating contact there needs to be something that draws you together something that intrigues you about the other person not once in my life had i ever experienced a feeling like that of being drawn to a total stranger so while i understood the concept he was talking about the feelings he described were totally foreign to me   now a few weeks back i was browsing reddit i wish i could remember what sub i was on but i remember it was just some random totally innocuous gaming or meme sub i came across an interesting discussion where people were talking a little bit about this disconnect i ve been feeling and the tendency to be attracted to friends over strangers that s where the word demisexual came up a word i had never heard before   for those unaware a demisexual person is one who requires an emotional bond with another person before they can be sexually attracted to them it s not a matter of the emotional connection being more important or valuing personality over sex appeal or anything like that without the emotional bond attraction just simply doesn t exist at all it s a label that falls on the asexuality spectrum   i related pretty strongly to this sentiment and i started reading more about it the more i read the more i could relate it felt like someone was basically writing about my own life there s quite a few experiences common to demisexual people like being really uncomfortable when someone you don t know well shows romantic interest or flirts with you or finding it really really rare to have a crush or romantic interest in someone and feeling it extremely intensely when you do or just not getting it when people talk about others being attractive or unattractive i related to all of these experiences completely   at this point i am comfortable with saying that i am demisexual   for a long time i thought i was in some sense broken or emotionally damaged for experiencing romance this way for example i would always be down on myself whenever something didn t work out with a friend i was interested in i felt like part of my problem was that i was always getting too emotionally invested before even attempting to act on it but i learned through all of the reading that i was doing that this is a common thing that demisexual people go through due to the way our attraction works for some there is no middle setting between no romantic interest whatsoever and    emotionally invested in the outcome of this romantic pursuit  it s more like a flip of a switch than a spectrum of attraction and interest reading about this and about how this is more about how i am wired and that there isn t something wrong with me for always getting invested in this way brought me a lot of peace   i learned through all this reading that this is an experience shared by many i m not broken at all i just experience love and attraction in a way that s different to most people there s nothing wrong with feeling this way that s just how i m wired   today i told my best friend about this she s the first person i told and in addition to wanting to share it with her i also wanted to tell her as a way of trying on the label if that makes sense i know it felt right to me doing all this reading online but i wasn t totally confident yet i wanted to see if it still felt right when i described myself as demisexual to someone else and explained my experience and it really really did i felt like for the first time ever i could articulate exactly how i experience attraction to others exactly what the disconnect i feel with how most people experience attraction and dating is and exactly why i ve had such a struggle finding someone to connect with in a romantic sense being the amazing friend that she is of course she accepted all of this asked questions and listened to all of my experiences   it felt amazing  i can t overstate how happy i am right now and how genuinely and completely right it felt to describe myself with the label of demisexual i feel like i understand a huge part of myself that i didn t even know existed i am happier right now than i can remember being in months   i still have a long way to go of course this wasn t a magical cure for depression and i am still going to therapy to better understand myself and work through a lot of the other issues i ve been dealing with i m not totally sure if how to come out to certain family and friends and looking for love as a demisexual person comes with its own special set of challenges that i don t yet know how to go about overcoming but i feel like i understand myself in a completely different and deeper sense than i did before and i feel belonging and validation in a way that i didn t before today is the first time i ve felt good about myself in a very very long time and i m just so so happy it s hard to believe all of this came out of a reddit thread completely unrelated to any of this but that things like this can happen is one of the many reasons i love this website now i can honestly say that it s changed my life   if you read all the way here thank you i m just really really excited about all this and i felt like i absolutely had to share

happy,IridiumTrigger,self.happy,2020-05-20 13:17:12,i just realize a piece of advice from long ago is so true a really long time ago someone told me not to be afraid to take risks and be vulnerable because that is what you need to do to make happy memories and get somewhere in life it always made sense to me but i just realized something that highlighted how true it is   i started dating my very first girlfriend my junior year of high school she was a senior she was my sister s good friend and when my sister went off to college we started talking and soon i asked her out i think i knew even at the time that the odds were completely against this relationship she was the number  student in her class destined for ivy league i had another year at school left and we would likely if we stayed together a whole year be doomed to a  year long term relationship if we tried to make it work   i went with my heart and we were madly in love for the next year but of course it ended after she went away i ended up breaking up with her but we both new it was coming i think i narrowly beat her to the punch it broke my heart and hers and at the time i regretted ever letting myself fall in love    years later and i just thought about her for the first time in god knows how long months years however i realize my perspective is totally changed i don t remember what the pain felt like i don t remember missing her and i certainly don t miss her now i don t feel the echo of a hole that was left in my life all those year ago all those relationships ago   the only thing i can really remember is the enormous love i felt for her how sweet and cute she was our first kiss her laying her head on my shoulder or my chest laughing until we couldn t breathe i have no idea about what the joy i felt sneaking out to meet her and laying in a field under the stars all night talking about everything we wanted to do it was so pure and uncomplicated i haven t spoken to her in probably  years i have no idea where she lives what she does what her life is but she is still a part of me and it s a good part   just wanted to share

happy,ACuriousFrenchie,self.happy,2018-12-16 21:09:51,today i celebrate one year without purging  hello everyone   i wanted to share this because i just realized it s been one year since i ve purged for those who don t know purging is a word used by people with eating disorders to reference anything done to get rid of excess calories in may case it was throwing up   i grew up as an overweight kid which caused a lot of self esteem issues and was generally uncomfortable and eventually around  years old i started throwing up to get rid of excess calories at first frankly because i felt so bloated from eating so much but eventually it became just an easy way to clean the slate after binging   thankfully around  years old i lost a ton of weight and along it my bulimia or at least the behavior i was also obsessed with working out i remember going for a  km jog at  pm under the rain in november in canada and constantly dieting frankly i felt fat this was clearly unsustainable and the moment i had my first midterms i started binging again and that freaked me out because i didn t want to be overweight again so i started purging   eventually i balooned back to where i was in a very short amount of time and even hit new records the accessibility of food and the fact i could hide in my apartment alone while doing so made it so easy and i was in a pit my whole life was centered around food it was affecting my relationship my studies everything i felt controlled by food and still feel like that today i was miserable   every week i told myself it ll be different that i ll finally work on all this and get out of it start getting better i begged myself to and every week i ended up binging and throwing up again to the point that whenever i told myself  new week new chance  i would immediately think  just like the weeks before and what changed since then  and frankly i was right there was no reason why it would be different   it came to a point that three years after starting university i called my father crying saying i hit rock bottom and that if i didn t do something i was going to ruin my life i had always been scared of telling my dad because i was scared of disappointing him but to my surprise he was very supportive in fact he told me he faced similar issues in college which was great to hear not because i want anyone else to have bulimia but because i see him as my role model and if he could do it so can i   anyway i decided to see a therapist since then which has helped me tremendously my therapist was just incredible and made me realized so many things but mostly she took me seriously and she didn t judge me like at all i spend my life judging me saying how i m a bad guy and x and y so it was such a relief to have her tell me that i m not   and then one day i stopped binging and the days started piling up to today which added up to a year i finally realized that the harm i was doing to myself throwing up was much greater than the harm of weight gain the most interesting part is that even though i came to my therapist for my eating disorder i don t recall once where we actually discussed it was a true eye opener when she pointed that out   i ve yet to stop binging and so have gained weight during this year since i didn t throw up but i definitely feel on the way of dealing with that too my binges are much smaller and less frequent and i ve already lost  kg from my heaviest weight this summer  although even at my heaviest i was in average happier and better in my skin than i ever was at my lightest   thank you for reading i just wanted to share because i give myself a lot of sh t for not being better as i forget how far i ve come hope this helps some of you guys

happy,OverclockingUnicorn,self.happy,2018-12-09 19:35:09,i don t even care i m working  hour weeks because i love my job  preface i m not great at writing so apologies on the rambly nature of this    i ve never really felt like i ve belonged to a group of people i ve had a few friends here or there throughout my early teens and i m grateful of that  although less grateful of a lot of my fellow peers but that another story   on starting college    yrs in the uk i thought my life would remain fairly the same but little did i know i very quickly found myself surrounded by some of the most awesome friends i could hope for i quickly learned how to become a somewhat normal member of society and went to a few parties and even had a girlfriend for a few months which was honestly an amazing few months fortunately we parted on good terms and are still very good friends now   i honestly don t know what my life would be like without this awesome group of people potentially i wouldn t even be here but again that s a story for another day   however after finishing college i took a gap year before university while all but one of them went to uni or got full time jobs and for the first few weeks i felt myself really missing them i loved being able to come in and be able to be around these people it just made me happy which is something i don t find comes easily   going back to just over a year ago i started a new job at the local theatre and entertainment venue as a casual hours technician i knew i d prefer this job to my previous one retail work very much not for me i only lasted  weeks   it has taken almost a year to get used to it getting to know the team and build relationships with my coworkers and manager i still don t think anyone there would describe me as chatty but i m able to have conversations with them and not feel like i m lost which was certainly the case with my retail job   for the last month or so we have been very busy with it being christmas there are lots of christmas parties in the function rooms and we have been manically setting up and rehearsing for the pantomime as a consequence i ve been racking up some serious hours  and some serious paychecks too   just this week i ve worked  out of  days and have done over  hours any sane person would be done by this point but i m not i can t wait for the rest of december   i really have found a home for my gap year a group of people i see every day can have a good laugh with and enjoy myself while getting paid too  i even seem to have made a few friends and we are going to lego land next week on the only day we don t have any panto shows   i don t always enjoy life i m hardly someone who s always happy  if fact it used to be almost never  and i ll become pretty sad quite easily  i also struggle with mental health issues but have yet to have any formal diagnosis but i am working on that too trying to better understand myself and deciding on what i should do to help move forward work however gives some joy actually quite a lot to be honest to my life i otherwise wouldn t have and i m incredibly thankful of that and of the people that help make it possible   i do worry consistently about going off to university next year having to start from ground zero again trying to find another  hopefully  awesome group of people to spend time with and trying to carry on doing work in an industry i love but would never pursue professionally but i ve still got  more months before that s a reality i ll need to face and hopefully those months will be as enjoyable as the last few have been
